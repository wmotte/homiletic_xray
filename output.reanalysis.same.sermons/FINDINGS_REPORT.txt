REANALYSIS COMPARISON: RUN A vs RUN B
D. Sölle Sermons - Model Output Variability Analysis
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
This analysis compares two independent LLM analysis runs (A and B) on the same
set of D. Sölle sermons across 9 analytical domains to quantify model output
variability and assess reliability.

OVERALL STATISTICS
------------------
Total paired comparisons: 1643
Mean absolute difference: 0.348 points
SD of absolute difference: 0.638 points
Median absolute difference: 0 points
Maximum absolute difference: 5 points

AGREEMENT METRICS
-----------------
Exact matches (difference = 0): 1157 (70.4%)
Within 1 point: 1562 (95.1%)
Overall correlation (Pearson r): 0.929
Overall ICC: 0.929 [0.923-0.936] - Excellent

DOMAIN-LEVEL FINDINGS
---------------------
Ranked by mean absolute difference (highest variability first):

1. narrative: Mean |diff| = 0.61, Correlation = 0.866, Exact matches = 61.9%
2. speech_act: Mean |diff| = 0.39, Correlation = 0.929, Exact matches = 69.4%
3. transactional: Mean |diff| = 0.36, Correlation = 0.940, Exact matches = 73.5%
4. schulz_von_thun: Mean |diff| = 0.34, Correlation = 0.817, Exact matches = 66.4%
5. dekker: Mean |diff| = 0.33, Correlation = 0.921, Exact matches = 71.4%
6. metaphor: Mean |diff| = 0.29, Correlation = 0.873, Exact matches = 78.3%
7. aristoteles: Mean |diff| = 0.29, Correlation = 0.884, Exact matches = 70.1%
8. kolb: Mean |diff| = 0.27, Correlation = 0.938, Exact matches = 72.3%

KEY INSIGHTS
------------
1. CONSISTENCY LEVEL: The overall ICC of 0.929 indicates excellent agreement between runs, suggesting the LLM produces relatively consistent scores
   when analyzing the same sermon content.

2. SYSTEMATIC BIAS: The mean difference (B - A) of 0.004 suggests no systematic bias between runs.

3. DOMAIN VARIABILITY: narrative shows the highest variability (0.61 mean |diff|), while kolb is most stable (0.27 mean |diff|).

4. SCORE TYPE VARIABILITY: Some specific score types within domains show notably
   higher variability than others (see heatmap and summary_by_score_type.csv).

5. PRACTICAL INTERPRETATION: With 95.1% of scores within 1 point
   difference, the model shows acceptable reliability for comparative analysis
   across sermons, though individual scores should be interpreted with caution
   (typical uncertainty of ~0.3 points).

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
- When comparing sermons, focus on differences > 1.3 points for confidence
- Consider averaging multiple runs for high-stakes analyses
- Domain-specific findings should weight reliability levels appropriately
- Absolute scores are less reliable than relative rankings
