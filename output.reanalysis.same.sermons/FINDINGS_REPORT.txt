REANALYSIS COMPARISON: RUN A vs RUN B
D. Sölle Sermons - Model Output Variability Analysis
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
This analysis compares two independent LLM analysis runs (A and B) on the same
set of D. Sölle sermons across 6 analytical domains to quantify model output
variability and assess reliability.

OVERALL STATISTICS
------------------
Total paired comparisons: 1512
Mean absolute difference: 0.327 points
SD of absolute difference: 0.564 points
Median absolute difference: 0 points
Maximum absolute difference: 4 points

AGREEMENT METRICS
-----------------
Exact matches (difference = 0): 1047 (69.2%)
Within 1 point: 1456 (96.3%)
Overall correlation (Pearson r): 0.927
Overall ICC: 0.927 [0.919-0.934] - Excellent

DOMAIN-LEVEL FINDINGS
---------------------
Ranked by mean absolute difference (highest variability first):

1. transactional: Mean |diff| = 0.43, Correlation = 0.917, Exact matches = 71.9%
2. schulz_von_thun: Mean |diff| = 0.34, Correlation = 0.817, Exact matches = 66.4%
3. esthetiek: Mean |diff| = 0.34, Correlation = 0.867, Exact matches = 62.3%
4. dekker: Mean |diff| = 0.33, Correlation = 0.921, Exact matches = 71.4%
5. aristoteles: Mean |diff| = 0.33, Correlation = 0.847, Exact matches = 67.9%
6. kolb: Mean |diff| = 0.27, Correlation = 0.938, Exact matches = 72.3%

KEY INSIGHTS
------------
1. CONSISTENCY LEVEL: The overall ICC of 0.927 indicates excellent agreement between runs, suggesting the LLM produces relatively consistent scores
   when analyzing the same sermon content.

2. SYSTEMATIC BIAS: The mean difference (B - A) of -0.007 suggests no systematic bias between runs.

3. DOMAIN VARIABILITY: transactional shows the highest variability (0.43 mean |diff|), while kolb is most stable (0.27 mean |diff|).

4. SCORE TYPE VARIABILITY: Some specific score types within domains show notably
   higher variability than others (see heatmap and summary_by_score_type.csv).

5. PRACTICAL INTERPRETATION: With 96.3% of scores within 1 point
   difference, the model shows acceptable reliability for comparative analysis
   across sermons, though individual scores should be interpreted with caution
   (typical uncertainty of ~0.3 points).

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
- When comparing sermons, focus on differences > 1.1 points for confidence
- Consider averaging multiple runs for high-stakes analyses
- Domain-specific findings should weight reliability levels appropriately
- Absolute scores are less reliable than relative rankings
