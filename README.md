# Homiletic Feedback Toolkit

A comprehensive analysis of sermons using nine homiletical frameworks.

## Overview

This toolkit analyzes sermons through nine complementary lenses:

1. **Dekker's Theses** - "What is a Sermon?" (Dr. W.M. Dekker's 8 theological criteria)
2. **Aristotelian Modes** - Classical rhetoric (Logos, Pathos, Ethos)
3. **Schulz von Thun** - Four-Sides-Model communication analysis
4. **Kolb's Learning Cycle** - Experiential learning in preaching
5. **Aesthetic Turn** - Contemporary homiletical aesthetics
6. **Transactional Analysis** - Psychological dynamics and manipulation detection (Eric Berne)
7. **Conceptual Metaphor Theory** - Cognitive linguistics analysis of metaphorical mappings (Lakoff & Johnson)
8. **Narrative Semiotics** - Actantial/Greimassian analysis of narrative structure and theological roles
9. **Speech Act Theory** - Illocutionary force analysis (Austin, Searle)

## The Nine Methods: Complementary Perspectives

The nine analytical methods each offer a unique perspective on preaching practice:

**Dekker's Theses** evaluate theological content: Is the sermon scriptural, Christocentric, and existential?

**Kolb's Learning Cycle** assesses pedagogical effectiveness: Are all learning styles addressed and is the listener guided through a complete cycle?

**Aristotelian Modes** diagnose rhetorical power: Is the sermon logically coherent (Logos), emotionally resonant (Pathos), and authentically delivered (Ethos)?

**Schulz von Thun** examines communicative integrity: Is the message congruent and does it land purely on the listener's four ears?

**Aesthetic Turn** judges artistic form: Is the truth carried by narrative and literary craft?

**Transactional Analysis** tests psychological health: Is the communication free from manipulation and does it promote autonomy?

**Conceptual Metaphor Theory** uncovers cognitive mappings: What conceptual metaphors structure the sermon's theology and what are their entailments?

**Narrative Semiotics** reveals narrative roles: Who is the Subject of salvation and where is the hearer positioned in the actantial schema?

**Speech Act Theory** analyzes performative force: Does the sermon merely describe or does it actually bestow grace through declarative speech acts?

Together, these methods form a holistic evaluation:

- **Dekker asks:** "Is it true?"
- **Kolb asks:** "Is it learned?"
- **Aristotle asks:** "Is it persuasive?"
- **Schulz von Thun asks:** "Is it congruent?"
- **Aesthetic Turn asks:** "Is it beautiful?"
- **TA asks:** "Is it healthy?"
- **CMT asks:** "Is it cognitively coherent?"
- **Narrative Semiotics asks:** "Is it grace-structured?"
- **Speech Act Theory asks:** "Does it perform what it proclaims?"

A sermon can be theologically sound (Dekker: high) yet fail to reach different learning styles (Kolb: low), lack emotional impact (Aristotle: low Pathos), be aesthetically flat (Aesthetics: low), or be psychologically manipulative (TA: low). By using all methods, the preacher gains a complete picture of strengths and weaknesses.

## The Nine Analytical Frameworks

### 1. Dekker's Theses (Theological)
Analyzes sermons against Dr. W.M. Dekker's 8 criteria for "What is a Sermon?":
- Specific Bible passage as foundation
- Exegesis of original context
- Concrete contemporary application
- Interwoven exposition and application
- Three parts: misery, redemption, gratitude
- Two ways: seriousness of choice
- Christocentric grace
- Depth and length (minimum 20 minutes)

**Best for:** Theological integrity, biblical fidelity

### 2. Aristotelian Modes (Rhetorical)
Classical rhetorical analysis:
- **Logos** - Rational architecture and logical coherence
- **Pathos** - Emotional resonance and affective power
- **Ethos** - Credibility and authenticity of the preacher
- Rhetorical balance assessment

**Best for:** Communication effectiveness, persuasive power

### 3. Schulz von Thun (Communication)
Four-Sides-Model analysis:
- **Factual Content** (blue) - The theological "Sache"
- **Self-Revelation** (green) - Preacher authenticity
- **Relational Aspect** (yellow) - Preacher-congregation dynamics
- **Appeal** (red) - Call vs. promise (Law vs. Gospel)

**Best for:** Communication psychology, relationship dynamics

### 4. Kolb's Learning Cycle (Pedagogical)
Experiential learning in preaching:
- Concrete Experience - Engagement and identification
- Reflective Observation - Problem analysis
- Abstract Conceptualization - Theological framing
- Active Experimentation - Application and practice
- Integration with Osmer's practical theology

**Best for:** Educational effectiveness, transformative learning

### 5. Aesthetic Turn (Performance)
Contemporary homiletical aesthetics with three integrated domains:

**Domain A: Poetics of Language (Micro-Aesthetics)**
- Imagery and metaphor - sensory, living language vs. dead clichés
- Care and precision - stewardship of language, avoiding jargon
- Musicality and rhythm - oral quality, sentence variation

**Domain B: Dramaturgy of Structure (Macro-Aesthetics)**
- Narrative arc (plot) - dynamic journey vs. static points
- Text-context integration - "reframing" biblical strangeness
- Openness vs. closedness - sermon as "open work of art"

**Domain C: Performance Aesthetics (Embodiment)**
- Authenticity and presence - congruence of message and person
- Voice use and silence - creating "space for grace"
- Liturgical embedding - sermon as part of worship drama

**Key Concepts:** Distinguishes authentic emotion from kitsch (pre-chewed sentiment), evaluates "space for grace" vs. closed manipulation, assesses whether sermon creates new "optics" through reframing.

**Best for:** Artistic quality, performative power, authenticity, avoiding religious kitsch

**NB:** Aesthetic ratings related to EMBODIMENT are ignored. Future research may use data from video recordings - if available - to incorporate physical parameters such as body movement.

### 6. Transactional Analysis (Psychological)
Based on Eric Berne's Transactional Analysis, this framework exposes psychological dynamics and potential manipulation ("games") in preaching:

**Ego State Analysis:**
- **Parent Ego State** - Critical Parent (CP) vs. Nurturing Parent (NP)
  - Freedom from coercive judgment and "must" language
  - Healthy, non-smothering care and support
- **Adult Ego State** - Rational, here-and-now communication
  - Invitation to critical thinking and autonomous faith
- **Child Ego State** - Adapted Child (AC) vs. Free Child (FC)
  - Freedom from fear-based compliance
  - Authentic joy, wonder, and spontaneity

**Transaction Analysis:**
- Primary transaction style (Parent-Child, Adult-Adult, etc.)
- Communicative purity vs. ulterior motives
- Detection of crossed or hidden transactions

**Games Analysis:**
- Detection of psychological "games" (NIGYSOB, Blemish, etc.)
- Formula G analysis: Con → Gimmick → Switch → Payoff
- Absence of manipulative patterns

**Drama Triangle:**
- Preacher roles: Rescuer, Persecutor, Victim
- Congregation positioning
- Escape possibilities toward autonomy

**Best for:** Psychological health, detecting manipulation, promoting Adult-Adult communication, avoiding guilt-driven rhetoric

### 7. Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Cognitive)
Based on Lakoff & Johnson's cognitive linguistics, this framework analyzes the conceptual metaphors that structure theological understanding:

**Metaphor Domain Analysis:**
- Identification of source and target domains
- Mapping structure between concrete and abstract concepts
- Coherence and conflict between metaphorical systems

**Entailment Analysis:**
- Cognitive implications of metaphorical choices
- Theological implications (intended and unintended)
- Ethical and pastoral entailments
- Risk of problematic inferences

**Vitality Assessment:**
- Dead metaphors vs. living metaphors
- Conventional vs. novel metaphorical expressions
- Strategies for revitalizing theological language

**Best for:** Understanding how language shapes theological cognition, identifying hidden assumptions, ensuring metaphorical coherence

### 8. Narrative Semiotics (Structural)
Based on Greimas's actantial model, this framework analyzes the narrative structure and role assignments in sermons:

**Actantial Schema:**
- **Subject** - Who acts toward the goal (God/Christ or human?)
- **Object** - What is sought (salvation, transformation, obedience?)
- **Sender** - Who mandates the quest (divine initiative?)
- **Receiver** - Who benefits (congregation's position)
- **Helper** - What aids the quest (Spirit, faith, community)
- **Opponent** - What opposes (sin, death, world)

**Grammatical Analysis:**
- God-as-Subject vs. human-as-subject sentence count
- Modal analysis: Devoir (duty), Vouloir (will), Savoir (knowledge), Pouvoir (ability)
- Active voice vs. passive voice distribution

**Semiotic Square:**
- Primary theological oppositions
- Movement through contraries and contradictions
- Resolution strategies

**Best for:** Diagnosing moralizing sermons, ensuring God remains the Subject of salvation, positioning hearers as receivers of grace

### 9. Speech Act Theory (Performative)
Based on Austin and Searle's speech act theory, this framework analyzes the illocutionary force and performative dimension of preaching:

**Illocutionary Analysis:**
- **Assertives** - Describing, explaining, teaching
- **Directives** - Commanding, requesting, inviting
- **Commissives** - Promising, pledging, guaranteeing
- **Expressives** - Praising, lamenting, thanking
- **Declaratives** - Absolving, blessing, pronouncing

**Constative vs. Performative:**
- Constative surplus: Too much describing, not enough doing
- Performative deficit: Missing declarations and promises
- Balance between teaching and bestowing

**Address Analysis:**
- Person distribution (first, second, third person)
- Temporal orientation (past, present, future)
- Direct address vs. third-person distance

**Best for:** Ensuring sermons perform what they proclaim, moving from "talking about" God to "speaking for" God, sacramental effectiveness

## Scoring Philosophy

All frameworks use **strict academic grading** (1-10 scale):

- **1-3**: Serious deficiencies, fundamental problems
- **4-5**: Weak to mediocre, clear improvement needed
- **6**: Satisfactory - meets basic requirements
- **7**: Good - consciously handles criteria effectively
- **8**: Strong - stands out, few refinements needed
- **9-10**: Exceptional - model sermon (very rare)

**Important:** A score of 6 means "functions reasonably" - not excellent. Scores of 7+ are reserved for sermons that truly excel.

**Anonymous (Hervormd).** Sermons from Reformed congregations (*Hervormde Gemeenten*) in the Netherlands, delivered during morning services on January 11, 2026. These congregations are formally part of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (PKN), but retain their traditional name and generally represent the more conservative wing of the denomination. The recordings were collected via [Kerkomroep](https://www.kerkomroep.nl) from multiple provinces across the Netherlands. A single date was chosen to ensure no overlap between preachers. Place names and church names have been anonymized. All sermons have been carefully reviewed for correct punctuation and speech errors, ensuring a fair comparison with printed sources.
