# Homiletic Feedback Toolkit

A comprehensive analysis of sermons using five homiletical frameworks.

## Overview

This toolkit analyzes sermons through five complementary lenses:

1. **Dekker's Theses** - "What is a Sermon?" (Dr. W.M. Dekker's 8 theological criteria)
2. **Aristotelian Modes** - Classical rhetoric (Logos, Pathos, Ethos)
3. **Schulz von Thun** - Four-Sides-Model communication analysis
4. **Kolb's Learning Cycle** - Experiential learning in preaching
5. **Aesthetic Turn** - Contemporary homiletical aesthetics

## Features

- ✅ **5 Analytical Frameworks** - Comprehensive multi-perspective sermon evaluation
- ✅ **English Prompts** - Professional, theologically rigorous analysis prompts
- ✅ **Batch Processing** - Analyze multiple sermons automatically
- ✅ **JSON Output** - Structured, parseable results for further analysis
- ✅ **Strict Grading** - Academic rigor with 1-10 scoring (7+ is exceptional)
- ✅ **Detailed Feedback** - Quotes, strengths, improvement points, and overall assessment

## The Five Analytical Frameworks

### 1. Dekker's Theses (Theological)
Analyzes sermons against Dr. W.M. Dekker's 8 criteria for "What is a Sermon?":
- Specific Bible passage as foundation
- Exegesis of original context
- Concrete contemporary application
- Interwoven exposition and application
- Three parts: misery, redemption, gratitude
- Two ways: seriousness of choice
- Christocentric grace
- Depth and length (minimum 20 minutes)

**Best for:** Theological integrity, biblical fidelity

### 2. Aristotelian Modes (Rhetorical)
Classical rhetorical analysis:
- **Logos** - Rational architecture and logical coherence
- **Pathos** - Emotional resonance and affective power
- **Ethos** - Credibility and authenticity of the preacher
- Rhetorical balance assessment

**Best for:** Communication effectiveness, persuasive power

### 3. Schulz von Thun (Communication)
Four-Sides-Model analysis:
- **Factual Content** (blue) - The theological "Sache"
- **Self-Revelation** (green) - Preacher authenticity
- **Relational Aspect** (yellow) - Preacher-congregation dynamics
- **Appeal** (red) - Call vs. promise (Law vs. Gospel)

**Best for:** Communication psychology, relationship dynamics

### 4. Kolb's Learning Cycle (Pedagogical)
Experiential learning in preaching:
- Concrete Experience - Engagement and identification
- Reflective Observation - Problem analysis
- Abstract Conceptualization - Theological framing
- Active Experimentation - Application and practice
- Integration with Osmer's practical theology

**Best for:** Educational effectiveness, transformative learning

### 5. Aesthetic Turn (Performance)
Contemporary homiletical aesthetics with three integrated domains:

**Domain A: Poetics of Language (Micro-Aesthetics)**
- Imagery and metaphor - sensory, living language vs. dead clichés
- Care and precision - stewardship of language, avoiding jargon
- Musicality and rhythm - oral quality, sentence variation

**Domain B: Dramaturgy of Structure (Macro-Aesthetics)**
- Narrative arc (plot) - dynamic journey vs. static points
- Text-context integration - "reframing" biblical strangeness
- Openness vs. closedness - sermon as "open work of art"

**Domain C: Performance Aesthetics (Embodiment)**
- Authenticity and presence - congruence of message and person
- Voice use and silence - creating "space for grace"
- Liturgical embedding - sermon as part of worship drama

**Key Concepts:** Distinguishes authentic emotion from kitsch (pre-chewed sentiment), evaluates "space for grace" vs. closed manipulation, assesses whether sermon creates new "optics" through reframing.

**Best for:** Artistic quality, performative power, authenticity, avoiding religious kitsch


NB: Aesthetic ratings related to EMBODIMENT are ignored. Future research may use data from video recordings - if available - to incorporate physical parameters such as body movement.

## Scoring Philosophy

All frameworks use **strict academic grading** (1-10 scale):

- **1-3**: Serious deficiencies, fundamental problems
- **4-5**: Weak to mediocre, clear improvement needed
- **6**: Satisfactory - meets basic requirements
- **7**: Good - consciously handles criteria effectively
- **8**: Strong - stands out, few refinements needed
- **9-10**: Exceptional - model sermon (very rare)

**Important:** A score of 6 means "functions reasonably" - not excellent. Scores of 7+ are reserved for sermons that truly excel.
