    "sermon_start_end": "We have on our plate today two lepers and a Psalm. I Consider the cases of the two lepers. The first leper is Syrian commander, Naaman. This means he was a high-ranking general in the Syrian army, a political general [...] The ex-lepers know that the world is open to divine compassion. God is not yet finished with the healing work. And, dear sisters and brothers, neither are we!",

  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a clear, narrative-driven exposition of the Naaman and Markan leper stories. The 'Sache' (theological core) is the restorative power of God that overcomes chaos. However, the exegesis remains largely on the surface level of plot summary. While the connection to Psalm 30 is creative, the dogmatic depth regarding the nature of 'cleansing' versus 'healing' is thin. The preacher correctly identifies the 'living Christ' (Barth) as the source of life, but the transition from historical narrative to modern metaphor is rapid, potentially bypassing the 'scandal' of the particularity of the biblical text in favor of a generalized 'healing juice' theology.",
      "quotes": [
        "The story does not tell us how the healing happened, wanting us only to be amazed at the cure.",
        "Leprosy in the Bible becomes a metaphor for all kinds of diseases and malfunctions.",
        "The force of life overwhelmed the power of death."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear structural parallelism between the two biblical stories.",
        "Effective use of Psalm 30 as a liturgical response to the narratives."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Deepen the Christological 'Sache' beyond 'healing juices'.",
        "Address the tension of the 'not yet' more rigorously to avoid a prosperity-adjacent theology."
      ],
      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The language is accessible, though the 'healing juices' metaphor may feel slightly informal for the subject matter."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a personality that values empathy and social awareness. There is a conscious attempt at solidarity ('I assume that you are like me; none of you likely has leprosy'), yet the 'I' remains somewhat detached, acting more as a curator of stories than a witness of personal transformation. The self-revelation is controlled and professional. There is a hint of 'Selbstdarstellung' in the rhythmic, almost poetic listing of modern 'leprosies', which suggests a preacher who is comfortable with rhetorical flourish but perhaps avoids deeper personal vulnerability.",
      "quotes": [
        "I assume that you are like me; none of you likely has leprosy.",
        "I dare extrapolate from these leper stories one more step.",
        "We sense it in our bones..."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive with Compulsive traits. The preacher seeks harmony and closeness through shared metaphors of suffering (Depressive) but maintains a very tight, structured 'I-II-III-IV' logic to keep the emotional content contained (Compulsive).",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is largely subservient to the text, though the rhetorical style occasionally draws more attention to the preacher's skill than the text's raw power.",
      "strengths": [
        "Avoids narcissistic over-sharing.",
        "Maintains a professional, pastoral distance while remaining empathetic."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could benefit from more 'Selbstenthüllung'—where does the preacher themselves stand in the 'night' of verse 5?",
        "Reduce the reliance on repetitive rhetorical structures."

    },
    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teaching-Solidary'. The preacher addresses the congregation as 'dear sisters and brothers' and attempts to meet them in their various 'leprosies'. However, the list of modern ailments (HIV, bad investments, phony feelings) feels somewhat like a diagnostic checklist. This can create a 'paternalistic' distance where the preacher identifies the congregation's problems from the safety of the pulpit. The 'We-definition' is inclusive but lacks a specific local 'hook', making the relationship feel somewhat generic.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now I know this is not your story.",
        "Some of you figure you are a phony...",
        "Dear sisters and brothers, neither are we!"
      ],
      "relationship_noise_check": "The assumption 'none of you likely has leprosy' could be seen as dismissive of literal physical suffering, though intended metaphorically.",
      "attitude_indication": "Solidary-Teaching: The preacher positions themselves alongside the hearer but maintains the authority to define the hearer's 'leprosy'.",

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily toward 'Hope' and 'Action'. The theological balance between Zuspruch (Promise) and Anspruch (Demand) is skewed toward the end. The sermon begins with the gift of healing (Zuspruch) but concludes with a heavy appeal to 'enact the healing juices' (Anspruch). This risks turning the Gospel into a new law: the duty to heal the world. The Barthian concern here is that the 'Acting Subject' shifts from God/Jesus to the 'followers of Jesus' in the final section, potentially burdening the hearer with the task of 'cleansing the lepers' of the world.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is the task of the followers of Jesus to enact the healing juices...",
        "And, dear sisters and brothers, neither are we [finished]!",
        "The Psalm is an offer for all healed lepers to sing."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Starts with Zuspruch (God heals), ends with a strong Anspruch (We must heal). The transition is abrupt.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Moderate. The final call to action ('neither are we!') can feel like a moral imperative that overshadows the rest of the Psalm's focus on God's intervention.",
      "strengths": [
        "The appeal to sing (praise) is a healthy, non-pressured response to grace.",
        "Connects faith to social responsibility."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Ensure the 'Promise' remains the foundation even in the final call to action.",
        "Clarify that the 'healing' is God's work through us, not our own project."

  "congruence_and_disruptions": {
    "congruence_judgment": "The sermon is largely congruent, though the shift from the 'miraculous' biblical healings to the 'metaphorical' modern leprosies creates a slight communicative friction.",
    "dominant_side": "Red (Appeal) – Despite the narrative start, the sermon's trajectory is aimed at mobilizing the hearer's perspective and action.",
    "disruptions": "The 'metaphorical' leap in Section IV acts as a disruption; it risks de-contextualizing the biblical text to the point where the 'Blue' side loses its historical-theological weight.",
    "healing_disruption": "The list of 'leprosies' serves as a mild disruption, forcing the hearer to confront their own hidden 'lesions'."

  "reception_simulation": {
    "the_factual_ear_hears": "God healed people in the past through Elisha and Jesus; Psalm 30 is a song for such occasions.",
    "the_relational_ear_hears": "The preacher sees my struggles (addiction, marriage, failure) and wants me to feel included in the community of the 'healed'.",
    "the_appeal_ear_hears": "I need to stop being a 'phony', wait for the morning, and start working on healing the world's structures.",
    "the_self_revelation_ear_hears": "The preacher is a socially conscious, rhetorically skilled individual who views faith primarily as a 'performance of transformation'."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 5.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a competent piece of homiletical work that successfully bridges ancient text and modern experience through the use of metaphor. From a Schulz von Thun perspective, it is structurally sound but leans heavily on the 'Appeal' ear toward the end. Theologically, it follows a Barthian emphasis on God as the source of life, but it risks 'psychologizing' the Gospel by turning leprosy into a catch-all metaphor for any human dissatisfaction. The 'Riemann' diagnosis suggests a preacher who provides a safe, structured environment (Compulsive) while seeking to alleviate the congregation's pain (Depressive). The communicative 'Sache' is clear, but the 'Yellow' side (Relationship) remains somewhat distant due to the repetitive use of 'Some of you' rather than a shared 'We' in the struggle. The transition from the 'Gift' of healing to the 'Task' of the church is theologically traditional but communicatively demanding.",
    "barthian_warning": "High risk of psychologization. By turning leprosy into 'wistfulness' or 'poor investments', the radical 'Otherness' of God's intervention is reduced to a therapeutic renovation of life.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Strong narrative flow and structural clarity.",
      "Effective integration of the Psalter as a 'script' for the congregation.",
      "High level of empathy in the modern applications."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce the 'laundry list' of metaphors to focus on one or two deeply explored existential realities.",
      "Strengthen the 'Blue' side by exploring the theological necessity of the 'Priest' and 'Ritual' mentioned in the text.",
      "Shift the final appeal from human 'task' back to the 'Acting Subject' of God to avoid moralism."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A satisfactory sermon that communicates clearly but lacks the 'exceptional' depth required for a higher score. It serves the congregation well but stays within safe communicative boundaries."
