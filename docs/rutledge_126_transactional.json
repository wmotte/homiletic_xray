    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in liturgical preaching. By utilizing a strong Adult ego state, the preacher processes the 'here-and-now' realities of war and technology to invite the listener into a physical, communal reality. The use of the Nurturing Parent creates a safe 'Family' environment without the smothering dependency of 'I'm Only Trying To Help You.' The preacher avoids the Drama Triangle by identifying herself as a 'fellow hostage' and pointing to the Eucharist as a reality that exists independently of the preacher's or the listener's 'feelings.'",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The critique of the 'virtual communion wafer' woman could border on a 'Parental' judgment if not handled with the current level of self-awareness."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements and the 'raising questions' technique to maintain the Adult-Adult contract. Ensure that the 'Family' metaphor remains inclusive and does not inadvertently create an 'Us vs. Them' (Ain't It Awful) dynamic regarding the 'outside' world."
