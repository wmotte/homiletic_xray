      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is exceptionally strong in evoking concrete, visceral experiences. It moves from the high art of Mozart to the raw, relatable fear of a child facing a parent.

    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of a narrative-visionary approach that excels in the first half of Kolb's cycle. It effectively identifies a deep-seated human problem—the fear of a devouring deity—and uses psychological and cultural analysis to make this problem felt. The transition to the theological solution (Abstract Conceptualization) is clear but lacks exegetical depth, relying instead on the emotional power of the Franklin Graham story to carry the weight of the 'reversal.' The primary deficiency is the lack of Active Experimentation; the sermon provides a profound internal shift but fails to equip the hearer with concrete ethical or practical steps for their daily life. It is a 'priestly' sermon that comforts but does not 'prophetically' direct action.",

      "Use a 'Declarative' structure for the middle section to provide a firmer logical foundation for the 'reversal' theory."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a highly effective piece of visionary preaching that successfully navigates the 'feeling' and 'watching' phases of Kolb's cycle. It is particularly strong in its descriptive-empirical and interpretive tasks (Osmer). However, it remains incomplete as a learning cycle due to the absence of concrete application. The preacher succeeds in changing the hearer's 'vision' of God but leaves the 'hands' of the hearer unguided. For a more holistic impact, the preacher should aim to move from the 'space of grace' into the 'walk of faith' with specific ethical challenges."
