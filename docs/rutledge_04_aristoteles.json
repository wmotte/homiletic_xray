  "aristotelian_modes_analysis": {
    "logos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a strong, traceable rational architecture that bridges systematic theology (Barth) with biblical exegesis. The preacher establishes a clear 'Advent' framework for 'Ordinary Time,' creating a logical dialectic between 'waiting and hastening.' The argument moves systematically from the historical-critical difficulties of the text to a symbolic interpretation of the bridesmaids as the church. The logic is deductive: if the church is the community of the 'last times,' then it must possess 'stored-up' spiritual reserves. The connection between the Charleston tragedy and the parable is not merely emotional but serves as a logical proof of the sermon's thesis regarding the 'oil' as the witness of the Spirit.",
      "quotes": [
        "Advent is the dialectic between the waiting and the hastening, the faithful confidence that strains forward toward the day and the long endurance that’s required to wait for it.",
        "Matthew has arranged this link between the last judgment and the crucifixion in a most artful and intentional way.",
        "The reason it still makes sense, biblically speaking, to think of them as virgins is that Paul writes to the Corinthian church as follows..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear theological framework using Karl Barth’s eschatology.",
        "Effective refutation of 'moralistic' readings of the parable.",
        "Strong structural link between the Matthean text and the contemporary event."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition from scholarly commentary critiques to the main point is slightly discursive.",
        "The 'oil' metaphor could be defined with even more logical precision earlier in the text.",
        "The conclusion relies on a short phrase ('With him!') which, while rhetorically effective, could benefit from a tighter logical summary."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The Logos is anchored in systematic theology, providing a robust intellectual scaffolding that prevents the sermon from becoming purely sentimental."
    },
    "pathos": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The Pathos is exceptionally high due to the gravity of the Charleston massacre, yet it remains non-manipulative. The preacher avoids 'cheap' emotion by critiquing the 'premature' forgiveness seen at Columbine, which actually deepens the emotional weight of the Mother Emanuel response. The imagery of the 'middle of the night' and the 'guttering lamps' creates a palpable sense of existential urgency. By contrasting the 'mystification' of secular reporters with the 'hope' of the victims, the preacher evokes a profound sense of awe and spiritual gravity in the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "They have been in the middle of the night for a long time.",
        "Our society is broken, pretty much, but there will be a time when these times will be made right.",
        "They were standing out in the courtyard of their horribly violated church, and they were singing 'Let My Little Light Shine.'"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Masterful use of a high-stakes contemporary tragedy to illustrate biblical truth.",
        "Avoidance of sentimentality through a critique of 'premature' forgiveness.",
        "Effective use of sensory and situational darkness to mirror the 'waiting' of the church."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The initial humor regarding 'bridesmaids aren't virgins anymore' creates a slight tonal jar with the later gravity.",
        "The description of the 'wedding feast' could be more vividly painted to contrast the darkness.",
        "The emotional transition from the 'haggling over bride-price' commentary to the Charleston victims is abrupt."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The Pathos is 'heart-pathos' rooted in real-world suffering and supernatural resilience, making the gospel's hope feel earned rather than assumed.",
      "emotional_tone": "Solemn, expectant, and ultimately defiant hope."
    },
    "ethos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher establishes Ethos through humility and intellectual honesty. By admitting to 'struggling with this sermon' and acknowledging the limitations of white comprehension regarding the black church's experience, the speaker gains credibility as a witness rather than an expert. The Ethos is further strengthened by the preacher's long-term engagement with the Epistles and Old Testament, positioning them as a seasoned traveler returning to the Gospels. There is a clear sense of the preacher standing *under* the judgment and hope of the text alongside the congregation.",
      "quotes": [
        "When I started struggling with this sermon ten days ago, I wondered how in the world I was going to illustrate it.",
        "These are adults who have seen ugliness in human character that white people cannot even comprehend.",
        "It is not to the point to be told that the bridegroom is late because he is haggling over the bride-price! Not only is this sort of thing very discouraging for the preacher..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Honesty about the difficulty of the task and the limitations of the speaker's perspective.",
        "Authority derived from a deep immersion in the theological tradition (Barth, Scripture).",
        "Solidarity with the suffering church rather than a detached academic stance."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The personal anecdote about being a virgin 50 years ago, while authentic, borders on over-sharing for some liturgical contexts.",
        "The critique of 'progressive American Christians' could be perceived as slightly partisan, potentially alienating some hearers.",
        "Could include more 'we' language in the struggle for 'oil' to avoid sounding like a distant observer of the AME church."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The Ethos is that of a 'witness to a witness,' gaining authority by pointing to the lived faith of others while maintaining personal theological integrity.",
      "authenticity": "High level of vulnerability regarding the limits of white experience and the difficulty of preaching the text."

    "dominant_mode": "Pathos",
    "suppressed_mode": "None",
    "balance_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon achieves a rare and powerful balance. While Pathos is the most striking element due to the Charleston context, it is strictly disciplined by a Logos that refuses to let the sermon become a mere eulogy. The Ethos supports both: the preacher’s humility allows the Pathos of the AME church to shine through without the preacher getting in the way. The three modes reinforce each other: Barth's theology (Logos) explains the AME church's reaction (Pathos), which the preacher witnesses to with integrity (Ethos).",
    "consequences_of_imbalance": [
      "If Logos were weaker, the sermon would feel like an exploitative use of a tragedy.",
      "If Pathos were weaker, the sermon would seem cold and indifferent to the 'broken society' mentioned.",
      "If Ethos were weaker, the preacher would sound like they are 'lecturing' on a pain they do not understand."
    ],
    "recommendation_for_balance": "Maintain the current balance but perhaps tighten the opening 'commentary' section to get to the 'heart' (Pathos) more quickly."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_rhetorical_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a high-quality sermon that successfully navigates the tension between a difficult biblical parable and a devastating national tragedy. It avoids the common pitfalls of moralism and sentimentalism by grounding its appeal in a robust eschatological framework. The preacher uses the 'oil' in the lamps as a metaphor for the 'witness of the Spirit' and the 'mind of Christ' developed through long-term communal practice. The rhetorical power comes from the contrast between the 'darkness' of the event and the 'light' of the faith displayed by the victims. It is intellectually stimulating, emotionally resonant, and delivered with a credible, humble voice.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Integration of systematic theology (Barth) with current events.",
      "Nuanced handling of the theme of forgiveness.",
      "Strong symbolic interpretation of the 'oil' as spiritual reserve."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Tonal consistency in the introduction.",
      "Streamlining the critique of biblical commentaries.",
      "More direct application to the specific local congregation's 'oil' supply."
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Witnessing-Visionary",
    "audience_analysis": "Appeals to both the 'head' (theologians/students) and the 'heart' (those grieving or seeking hope in a broken world).",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Continue using 'witness' Ethos when discussing social issues.",
      "Experiment with more vivid descriptions of the 'Kingdom' to balance the 'Darkness'.",
      "Keep the dialectical structure (Waiting/Hastening) as it provides excellent Logos."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an excellent example of how to preach 'apocalyptically' in a way that is existentially relevant. It scores high because it does not settle for easy answers, instead pointing to a 'superhuman' maturity found in the community of faith. Through the lens of the Rhetorical Triangle, it is a well-balanced, sober, and effective piece of homiletical work."
