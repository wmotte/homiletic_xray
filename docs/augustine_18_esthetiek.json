    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon relies on the central biblical metaphor of the 'two roads,' but fails to expand it with fresh sensory detail. The imagery remains largely conceptual and binary. While it mentions 'swarms of people' and 'highways,' it does not paint the scene of the road itself—there is no 'dust,' no 'sweat,' no 'thorns.' It operates on what Paul Scott Wilson would call 'telling' rather than 'showing.' The metaphors are 'dead' in the sense that they are used as labels for vices rather than evocative windows into reality. The imagery serves a didactic function rather than an aesthetic one, lacking the 'cinematic' quality required for a higher score.",
      "quotes": [
        "Just as our earthly roads are called highways because they’re much used and, consequently, offer many attractions...",
        "Bypass the road of impurity, which also is wide because it services all the unchaste.",
        "Fear hell despite the hordes who gleefully dive into it."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Consistent use of the central 'road' metaphor to provide a visual anchor.",
        "Effective use of the 'horde' image to create a sense of social pressure.",
        "Clear spatial orientation (wide/narrow, life/death)."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Incorporate sensory details: what does the 'narrowness' feel like? Is it a mountain path or a cramped alley?",
        "Avoid using metaphors as mere synonyms for lists of sins.",
        "Develop the 'attractions' of the highway to make the temptation more vivid and relatable."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Predominantly 'telling'. The preacher explains what the roads represent rather than showing the experience of walking them."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably clear and economical, reflecting Marilyn Chandler McEntyre’s 'stewardship of language' through its lack of fluff. However, it suffers from a repetitive use of moral categories (impurity, greed, avarice) that borders on jargon. The precision is 'legal' rather than 'poetic.' It defines the 'broad road' by its occupants rather than its nature. While the sentences are well-constructed and the logic is easy to follow, it lacks the nuance of human experience, opting for broad generalizations about 'vast throngs' and 'the just.' It is honest language, but it lacks the 'loving precision' that does justice to the complexity of the hearer's struggle.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now, exactly what is that roomy thoroughfare, the one used solely by vices and evil passions?",
        "Is searching for the road to salvation compatible with yielding to intemperance, all the while showing up for religious services?",
        "The road to life is likewise concealed in alms and charitable deeds."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "High level of clarity; the message is impossible to misunderstand.",
        "Economical sentence structure with no wasted words.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "Reduce the reliance on a standard list of vices (the 'Canaanite' language of the time).",
        "Introduce more nuanced descriptions of the 'apathetic' seeker.",
        "Use more precise verbs to describe the 'finding' and 'searching' process."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Heavy use of traditional moral-theological jargon (vice, intemperance, avarice, unchaste). While clear in context, it feels formulaic."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a strong rhetorical rhythm, likely designed for oral delivery to a congregation. It utilizes parallelism and antithesis (wide/narrow, life/death, few/many) which creates a natural cadence. The use of rhetorical questions in §3 provides a staccato rhythm that builds tension. There is a 'preacher’s flow' that makes the text feel like a performance rather than a document. While not 'poetic' in a literary sense, its repetitive structures function like a chant or a steady drumbeat, which is aesthetically effective for its hortatory purpose. It avoids the 'paper language' of academic treatises.",
      "quotes": [
        "One narrow, the other wide; one leading to life, the other to death.",
        "Why so many seekers and so few finders? Because not everyone searches for it with equal diligence.",
        "Follow the small number of the just rather than the multitude of sinners."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent use of antithesis to create a balanced, rhythmic structure.",
        "Effective rhetorical questions that drive the oral delivery forward.",
        "Strong, authoritative 'beat' to the prose."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Vary the sentence length more; the constant binary rhythm can become monotonous.",
        "Incorporate more alliteration or assonance to make key phrases more memorable.",
        "Soften the 'staccato' of the warnings with more 'legato' passages of promise."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Strong oral language. It is clearly written to be heard and felt as a speech."
    },
    "average_score_language": 6.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is functional, clear, and rhetorically rhythmic, but lacks poetic depth. It excels in clarity and oral cadence (musicality), making it a strong piece of traditional rhetoric. However, it fails to provide fresh imagery, relying instead on 'dead' metaphors and moral categories. It is a 'sober-Reformed' style avant la lettre: direct, unadorned, and focused on the 'Word' as a tool for moral correction. It lacks the 'aesthetic surplus' that turns a moral lecture into a transformative work of art."
  },
  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The structure is largely static. It begins with the biblical text and immediately moves into an explanation of the two roads. There is no 'upsetting of the equilibrium' or 'homiletical plot' as described by Lowry. The sermon functions as an expanded definition rather than a journey. While it attempts to create tension by asking 'Why so many seekers and so few finders?', it resolves this immediately with a moral explanation. The energy remains constant throughout—a steady level of warning—rather than building to a climax or a surprising turning point. It is a 'three-point' structure in spirit, even if not in explicit numbering.",
      "quotes": [
        "As you can see, the Lord teaches that there are two roads lying before us...",
        "Now, exactly what is that roomy thoroughfare...?",
        "My brothers, if you want to seek and discover the one right path, you must love..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Logical progression from the general (the two roads) to the specific (the hidden nature of the narrow way).",
        "The conclusion provides a clear, albeit predictable, summary.",
        "The use of the Psalm at the end provides a liturgical 'resting point'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Start with a contemporary 'problem' or 'conflict' rather than a direct quote to create immediate tension.",
        "Create a 'turning point' where the difficulty of the narrow road is met by the grace of God, rather than just more effort.",
        "Develop a narrative movement where the hearer feels they are 'traveling' during the sermon."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "Static explanatory structure. It defines categories rather than moving through a plot."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The integration is 'top-down.' The biblical text is the undisputed authority, and the 'context' (the life of the hearers) is brought under its judgment. There is little 'reframing' in Cilliers' sense; the sermon confirms the existing moral frame of the audience rather than offering a surprising new lens. The 'context' is addressed through a list of generic sins (drunkenness, greed) which likely fit the audience, but the connection feels forced and 'preachy' rather than organic. The 'strangeness' of the text—the fact that God's way is 'narrow'—is used as a threat rather than an aesthetic mystery to be explored.",
      "quotes": [
        "Just as our earthly roads are called highways...",
        "Nowadays many people, simply because they are members of the Church, appear to be seeking salvation.",
        "Is one seeking the road to salvation if he sheds his brother’s blood...?"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear application to the life of the church member.",
        "The 'highway' analogy bridges the ancient text with the hearer's physical reality.",
        "Honest confrontation with the discrepancy between church membership and lifestyle."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Respect the 'strangeness' of the narrow road—why is it hidden? Explore the mystery rather than just the difficulty.",
        "Avoid 'springboarding' from the text into a pre-packaged list of moral failures.",
        "Offer a 'new frame' where the narrow road is seen as beautiful, not just difficult."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "No significant reframing. It confirms a traditional moral/binary frame."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 3,
      "analysis": "This is a highly 'closed' work of art. Following Ciska Stark’s criteria, there is almost no room for the hearer’s own interpretation or the 'ambivalence of existence.' The sermon is monovalent: there is one right way and one wrong way. Questions are asked only to be immediately answered by the preacher. The ending is prescriptive ('you must love and faithfully safeguard') rather than invitational. It treats the hearer as a student to be instructed or a wanderer to be warned, rather than a 'mature conversation partner.' There is no room for the 'already/not yet' tension; it is a sermon of 'do this and live.'",
      "quotes": [
        "As you can see, the Lord teaches that there are two roads...",
        "All these vices lead straight to death—which is why those who walk that road can’t simultaneously be looking for the road to life.",
        "If you want to seek and discover the one right path, you must love and faithfully safeguard the virtues..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Provides absolute clarity and certainty for the hearer.",
        "Strong sense of urgency and importance.",
        "Unambiguous call to action."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Leave some questions unanswered to stimulate the hearer's reflection during the week.",
        "Acknowledge the difficulty and 'gray areas' of the narrow road to increase polyvalence.",
        "End with an invitation to God's grace rather than a final command."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Closed/Monovalent. The sermon is a 'sealed' system of moral truth."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 4.0,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is architecturally sound but aesthetically rigid. It follows a traditional homiletic pattern of 'text-explanation-application' without any narrative arc or dramaturgical tension. It is a 'closed' work that leaves little room for the hearer's agency or the mystery of grace. The movement is purely logical and moralistic, lacking the 'event' character that Immink emphasizes. It functions as a map rather than a journey, providing clear directions but failing to inspire the traveler with the beauty of the destination."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids religious kitsch, not through aesthetic depth, but through a certain 'ascetic' harshness. It does not offer 'cheap comfort' or 'happy endings'; in fact, it does the opposite by emphasizing how 'few' are saved. There are no sentimental stories or manipulated emotions. However, it flirts with a different kind of kitsch: the 'cliché of the binary.' The 'broad road' and 'narrow road' are used as pre-chewed categories. It lacks 'authentic aesthetic depth' because it doesn't wrestle with the pain of the narrow road, but it is certainly not 'sentimental.' It is a 'sober' warning, which is the antithesis of kitsch sentimentality.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The somewhat clichéd 'gleeful dive' into hell, which simplifies the complexity of human sin into a cartoonish image.",
      "The formulaic list of 'vices and evil passions' which can feel like a pre-packaged religious script."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The stark admission that the narrow way 'seems hidden and invisible'—this touches on a real existential difficulty.",
      "The questioning of church members' sincerity: 'Is searching... compatible with yielding to intemperance?'"
    ],
    "recommendation": "To increase depth, move beyond the 'binary cliché' and describe the psychological and spiritual 'hiddenness' of faith with more vulnerability."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 3,
    "analysis": "In Cilliers' terms, this sermon 'closes space.' It is dominated by moralization and the 'imperative.' The 'Space for Grace' is restricted by the heavy emphasis on human 'diligence,' 'zeal,' and 'good will' as the conditions for finding the road. God is the 'Savior' who warns, but not the 'Actor' who carries the traveler. The mystery of the 'Holy' is replaced by the clarity of the 'Moral.' There is no room for the 'simul iustus et peccator'—one is either on the road to life or the road to death. By making the road 'hidden' and dependent on 'merit,' the sermon risks creating despair rather than opening a space for the 'unmerited' gift of grace.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are not sustained; they are resolved into a binary choice.",
    "mystery_respected": "No; the 'hidden' nature of the road is immediately explained away as a lack of human diligence.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Moralization prevails almost entirely over grace.",
    "recommendation": "Reintroduce the 'Divine Actor.' Show how the 'narrow gate' is opened by Christ for those who *cannot* find it on their own."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 4.8,
    "summary": "Aesthetically, this sermon is a product of 'Classical Rhetoric' placed in the service of 'Moral Parenesis.' It prioritizes clarity, authority, and binary logic over polyvalence, imagery, and narrative movement. While it possesses a strong oral rhythm (musicality) and avoids the 'kitsch' of cheap sentimentality, it fails the 'Aesthetic Turn' on several fronts. It is a 'closed work' that leaves no room for the hearer's interpretation, and it 'closes space' for grace through heavy moralization. The 'form' is that of a stern warning, which perfectly matches its 'content,' but this form is aesthetically thin—it lacks the 'surplus' of meaning that characterizes a truly 'open work of art.' It is a functional, 'sober' sermon that achieves its goal of instruction but fails to 'reframe' reality in a way that evokes wonder or aesthetic delight.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rhetorical clarity and logical consistency.",
      "Strong oral rhythm and use of antithesis.",
      "Absence of sentimental kitsch; it takes the 'seriousness' of life and death at face value."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Transition from 'telling' to 'showing' by using sensory imagery to describe the two roads.",
      "Open the structure to allow for the 'ambivalence of existence' and the hearer's own interpretation.",
      "Shift the focus from human 'merit' and 'diligence' to the 'Space for Grace' provided by God's action."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Hortatory / Classical Rhetorical",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Pre-Aesthetic Turn' style of Thurneysen (vertical authority), but lacks the 'Reframing' of Cilliers or the 'Openness' of Stark.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who seek clear moral boundaries and authoritative direction; less appealing to those seeking existential exploration or aesthetic wonder.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a 'Lowry-esque' plot: start with the 'hiddenness' of the road as a source of frustration.",
      "Use one concrete, contemporary story of a 'narrow' choice to ground the abstract vices.",
      "End with a 'Space for Grace'—a moment of silence or a prayer that leaves the outcome in God's hands."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically 'closed' and 'monovalent' discourse. While it demonstrates strong stewardship of language and a rhythmic oral quality, it lacks the 'poetic power' and 'dramaturgical movement' required for a high aesthetic rating in contemporary homiletics. It is a 'map' that is clear but lacks the beauty of the 'landscape' it describes."
