    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon relies heavily on the imagery provided by the biblical text (Isaiah 53) rather than generating original metaphors. The preacher uses evocative phrases like 'Calvary’s stark shame and fatal bruise,' which aligns with Paul Scott Wilson's emphasis on sensory language. However, the preacher's own commentary tends toward the abstract ('central commitment,' 'moral integrity of the universe'). The imagery is 'borrowed' rather than 'created' within the homiletical movement. While the 'root out of dry ground' is vivid, it is a citation, not a homiletical painting. The preacher 'tells' the meaning of the image rather than 'showing' a new scene.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The language is dignified and academic, but it flirts with 'Canaanite' jargon of a different sort—scholarly abstraction. Phrases like 'brief compass' and 'likeness of his resurrection' are precise in a theological sense but lack the 'loving language' McEntyre advocates for. The preacher uses 'surely' and 'represents' as rhetorical crutches to force meaning onto the text. There is a lack of nuance regarding the human experience of 'shame'; it is treated as a category rather than a felt reality. The stewardship of language is functional but lacks the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed tradition.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a steady, almost processional cadence. The use of the Isaiah passage provides a natural poetic rhythm that the preacher attempts to match. There is a decent use of parallelism ('thrilled and haunted', 'certified and guaranteed'). However, the sentence structure is somewhat monotonous, leaning toward the 'paper language' of an essay. It lacks the staccato energy required for a truly oral 'event' (Immink). The flow is predictable, which may soothe the hearer but fails to arrest them rhetorically.",

    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a formal, academic sobriety. It leans heavily on the aesthetic power of the biblical text (Isaiah) while the preacher's own voice remains largely abstract and conceptual. While the imagery of the 'fatal bruise' is striking, the overall poetics are hindered by a 'telling' style that prioritizes ethical definitions over sensory evocation. The rhythm is steady but lacks the dynamic variation necessary for a high-impact oral performance, resulting in a text that feels more like a theological lecture than a poetic event."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon lacks a clear 'upsetting of the equilibrium' (Lowry). It begins with a statement of fact rather than a problem or a 'trouble' page. The movement is deductive: a thesis is stated (Romans 6), illustrated (Isaiah 53), and then summarized. There is no palpable tension or 'plot' that carries the hearer from a state of need to a state of grace. It feels like a static meditation. The 'turning point' is intellectual rather than experiential. As a fragment, it is difficult to see a full arc, but the existing structure is linear and predictable.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The 'context' here is largely missing or implied as a general 'commitment to moral integrity.' There is no specific 'reframing' (Cilliers) of a contemporary situation. The biblical world is respected in its 'strangeness,' but the bridge to the hearer's world is built with very thin material ('twenty centuries'). The synthesis is more between two texts (Romans and Isaiah) than between the Text and the World. The hearer is told that this commitment 'haunts' them, but they are not shown *how* it intersects with their specific modern anxieties.",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is largely 'sealed shut' (Stark). It defines the 'likeness of his death' with certainty ('represents, surely...'). There is little room for the hearer's own struggle with shame or the 'ambivalence of existence.' The conclusion is a closed theological statement: Jesus' way was 'certified and guaranteed.' This leaves no space for the 'not yet' or the mystery of the cross. It approaches the hearer as a student to be instructed rather than a participant in an 'open work of art.' The polyvalence of the 'man of sorrows' is reduced to a single ethical category.",

    "average_score_structure": 4.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is largely static and deductive. It lacks a compelling narrative arc or a 'plot' that engages the hearer's curiosity or sense of need. The integration of text and context remains at a high level of abstraction, failing to 'reframe' the hearer's reality in a concrete way. Furthermore, the sermon's closed, definitive tone limits the 'openness' of the work, transforming the mystery of the Passion into a moral certainty that leaves little room for the hearer's active interpretation or spiritual struggle."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully avoids the most common forms of religious kitsch. It does not offer 'cheap comfort' or a 'happy ending' that ignores the reality of suffering. By focusing on 'stark shame' and 'fatal bruise,' it maintains a level of authentic aesthetic depth. However, the phrase 'moral integrity of the universe' borders on a different kind of kitsch—intellectualized sentimentality—where complex divine action is reduced to a tidy philosophical principle. It avoids 'sentiment' but risks becoming 'dry,' which is the opposite of kitsch but also a form of aesthetic failure.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential for 'guaranteed by God' to sound like a simplistic, pre-chewed solution.",

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 5,
    "analysis": "The sermon creates a 'Space for Grace' primarily through its biblical citations, which evoke the mystery of the suffering servant. However, the preacher's own commentary tends to 'close' this space through moralization. By framing the cross as a 'commitment to moral integrity,' the preacher turns a divine event into a human ethical task. The 'vertical dimension' (Thurneysen) is somewhat flattened into a horizontal 'way of life.' The 'mystery' is explained away as a 'summation.' While it isn't dogmatically sealed in a harsh way, it is ethically sealed in a way that might burden the hearer.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'shame' and 'integrity' is introduced but resolved too quickly by the word 'guaranteed'.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the 'man of sorrows' is largely translated into the understandable category of 'moral commitment'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Moralization prevails; the cross is presented as a model for our commitment rather than a space of God's radical, unavailable grace.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'shame' of the cross to remain unresolved for a moment. Instead of 'moral integrity,' speak of the 'scandal' of grace that works through weakness."

    "overall_aesthetic_score": 5,
    "summary": "This sermon fragment represents a 'Sober-Reformed' or 'Academic-Mainline' aesthetic style. It is characterized by high linguistic precision and a serious, formal tone that respects the biblical text. Its primary aesthetic strength lies in its refusal to engage in kitsch or superficial emotionalism. However, it suffers from a lack of 'homiletical movement.' The structure is static, and the language, while dignified, is overly abstract. The preacher 'tells' the hearer what the cross means ('moral integrity') rather than 'showing' the event of grace in a way that allows the hearer to see their own reality reframed. The aesthetic experience is more akin to reading a well-constructed essay than participating in a transformative oral event. It lacks the 'polyphony' and 'openness' that Stark and Cilliers advocate for, resulting in a message that is clear but perhaps not 'moving' in the deep, aesthetic sense of the word.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Avoidance of religious kitsch and cheap sentimentality.",

    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Thomas G. Long's 'Preacher as Witness' in its focus on the text, but lacks Paul Scott Wilson's 'Imagery' and Lowry's 'Plot'.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to an educated, intellectually-inclined congregation that values theological sobriety over emotional fervor.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Practice 'Show, Don't Tell': instead of saying 'moral integrity,' describe a situation where that integrity is tested.",
      "Use the 'Four Pages' model to ensure the 'trouble' of the text is felt before the 'grace' is announced.",
      "Incorporate oral rhetorical devices (repetition, varying sentence length) to move away from 'paper language'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a solid example of mid-century homiletical sobriety. It is intellectually honest and linguistically careful, but it lacks the 'aesthetic turn's' emphasis on performance, imagery, and openness. It functions as a teaching moment rather than a 'happening' of the holy. To move from a 5 to a 7 or 8, the preacher must dare to let the language become more poetic and the structure more dramatic, allowing the 'Space for Grace' to be something the hearer experiences rather than just hears about."
