      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon attempts to ground abstract theological concepts in concrete imagery, but often does so through literary metaphors rather than specific, lived-out anecdotes. While it mentions 'street people' and 'government buildings,' these function more as archetypes than as a shared 'slice of life' experience for the immediate hearer. The emotional connection is primarily intellectual-imaginative rather than visceral-experiential.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher consistently asks the hearer to pause and consider 'why' these images matter and how they contrast with the 'bland and domesticated' God usually preferred. There is a clear cultural critique of the desire for safety and the reality of systemic exploitation.",
      "quotes": [

      "analysis": "The sermon is theoretically robust. It provides a clear 'big idea': the character of God determines the quality of human existence. The exegesis of Isaiah 25 is systematic, and the theological move to Matthew's 'wedding garment' is logically argued as a requirement of response to God's character.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of a 'Visionary-Declarative' approach that prioritizes theological imagination and logical consistency. It successfully challenges the hearer's 'domesticated' view of God by providing a robust, multi-faceted biblical alternative. However, it falls short of completing the Kolb cycle because it lacks concrete, practical application (Active Experimentation). The preacher excels at 'Interpretive' and 'Normative' tasks but provides little 'Pragmatic' guidance. Consequently, while the hearer's 'Head' and 'Heart' are engaged through powerful metaphors like the 'sea monster' and 'demolition squad,' their 'Hands' are left without specific direction. The sermon is intellectually stimulating and spiritually evocative but remains somewhat detached from the mundane, daily 'how-to' of Christian discipleship.",

      "Use 'Pragmatic' language (e.g., 'This means tomorrow morning you could...') to balance the 'Visionary' metaphors."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a sophisticated theological exploration that effectively uses the 'Homiletic Window' to move between vision and declaration. It is highly successful in its 'Normative' task, establishing a clear biblical vision of God's character. However, from a Kolb perspective, it is an incomplete learning cycle. The transition from 'Abstract Conceptualization' to 'Active Experimentation' is the primary point of failure; the 'insistence' of the title is not matched by 'instruction' in the text. To move from a score of 6.5 to an 8, the preacher must bridge the gap between the 'wild God' and the 'daily walk' with specific, actionable handles for the congregation."
