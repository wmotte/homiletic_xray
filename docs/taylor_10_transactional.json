    "summary": "This sermon is an exceptionally healthy piece of communication. It avoids the common homiletical trap of using the Critical Parent to shame the listener into 'loving more.' Instead, it uses the Adult ego state to analyze the human condition and the Nurturing Parent to validate the reality of suffering. The preacher treats the congregation as autonomous peers capable of 'enlightened, aggressive' action.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement.",

      "Could incorporate more Free Child spontaneity to balance the heavy Adult/Parent reflections on death.",
      "The 'drunken man' anecdote, while effective, borders on using a 'stereotype' as a prop."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'We' instead of 'You' to maintain the Adult-Adult level and avoid the Persecutor role. Keep grounding theological concepts in 'here-and-now' reality."
