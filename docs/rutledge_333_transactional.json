  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust. It avoids the common trap of using Good Friday to induce Adapted Child shame. Instead, it uses the Adult ego state to analyze the human need for justice and the Parent ego state to offer a protective, cosmic solution. By linking the 'payment' to social justice rather than just individual 'fault-finding,' it bypasses the NIGYSOB game.",
    "strengths": [
      "Deconstruction of the 'Wrathful Father' (Persecutor) archetype.",
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement with historical and social data.",
      "Validation of the human need for 'closure' and 'justice' without shaming."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Somebody has got to pay' motif still flirts with a Parent-enforced 'Moral Order' that can trigger latent guilt.",
      "The distinction between suburban 'personal issues' and systemic 'justice' could be perceived as a Critical Parent 'shaming' of the affluent listener."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize the 'shared will' of the Father and Son to prevent the listener from falling into a Victim/Persecutor view of the Trinity."
