All the truly intelligent, urbane, sophisticated people [...] Submit to him this day, with joy, and know in your heart that the words will sound for you as they did for that other sinner of Bethany so long ago: “Lazarus, come forth.” AMEN."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon centers on Ezekiel 37, but it frequently drifts into generalities about the 'central myth' of Christianity. While it identifies the uniqueness of God acting for His own name's sake, it risks becoming a topical speech about faith vs. secularism.",
      "quotes": [
        "The lessons appointed for this fourth Sunday in Lent put the life-and-death themes of our faith before us in the most uncompromising fashion.",
        "I’m going to read you a gospel verse from Ezekiel... 'It is not for your sake... but for the sake of my holy name'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more sharply on the specific imagery of the 'dryness' of the bones as a unique diagnostic of the human condition that cannot be found in other texts."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher identifies the Babylonian exile and the corporate nature of Israel as the 'valley of bones.' However, there is no evidence of linguistic depth (Hebrew) or rigorous theological exegesis beyond a surface-level reading of the narrative.",
      "quotes": [
        "The valley of bones represents the whole nation of Israel, the covenant community, gone hopelessly astray because of persistent idolatry."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the specific theological weight of the Hebrew 'ruach' (breath/spirit/wind) to deepen the exposition of how God recreates."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Strong contemporary engagement with cultural figures (McInerney, Dinnage). The application is concrete in its critique of the 'zeitgeist' and the psychological state of the dying, avoiding vague moralism.",
      "quotes": [
        "Even more seductive... is the idea presently popular — even within the church — that you can soak up the rituals of the church without actually believing in anything.",
        "Jay McInerney’s mother was terrified that her eternal destiny hung in the balance because of her betrayal of her husband."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the 'cultural elite' as the primary foil; apply the text more directly to the specific 'dryness' found within the local congregation's spiritual life."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon alternates between cultural commentary and biblical text. While not a strict 'block' structure, the transitions sometimes feel like the text is an illustration for the cultural story rather than the text 'expounding' the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "What interests me today is its connection to the “central myth” and the message of Ezekiel.",
        "And so we come to the one passage in Ezekiel that almost everyone has heard about..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Allow the biblical imagery to dictate the structure of the contemporary analysis more fluidly, rather than using the McInerney story as a parallel track."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon excels in depicting 'misery' (sin as a sickness unto death) and 'redemption' (God acting for His name's sake). It avoids 'soft' misery by taking the mother's fear of judgment seriously.",
      "quotes": [
        "Holding back on the bad news about our sinful condition is a sure way to rob the good news of its dazzlement.",
        "The good news is that God’s ultimate purpose of mercy for humanity is not for our sake... it is for the sake of his holy name."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The 'gratitude' (sanctification/response) phase is somewhat truncated; the sermon ends on the call to come forth without exploring the life of gratitude that follows."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon acknowledges the possibility of being lost and the reality of judgment, which Dekker values. However, it leans heavily toward the 'eternal' loss without sufficiently addressing the 'temporal' loss of a life not answering God's call now.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ezekiel leaves us in no doubt about the inevitability and the severity of God’s judgment.",
        "She was right to be afraid. She knew she did not “deserve” a free pass into eternal bliss."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher should more explicitly present the 'two ways' as a present choice for the hearer, not just a retrospective on a dying woman."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon correctly identifies that grace is outside of human merit, rooted in the nature of God, and finds its climax in the person of Christ (Lazarus/Easter).",
      "quotes": [
        "What happens to us in spite of ourselves when we put our trust in the Lord Jesus is that his righteousness reaches out and snatches us.",
        "Jesus himself cannot be explained away... his death cannot be explained away."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the transition from Ezekiel's 'God's holy name' to 'Christ' is more dogmatically grounded in the doctrine of the two natures as Dekker suggests."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At roughly 18.5 minutes, the sermon falls just short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum for 'depth.' While it touches on significant themes, the brevity limits the 'breadth' required for true homiletical depth.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section (Thesis 2) to reach the 20-minute threshold and provide the necessary 'breadth' for the 'depth' of the subject matter."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's formal requirements regarding length and linguistic exegesis. It relies heavily on cultural anecdotes (McInerney) which, while effective, occasionally overshadow the specific uniqueness of the Ezekiel text. However, it strongly aligns with Dekker's demand for a non-subjective gospel—emphasizing that God acts for His own sake—and maintains a sharp, unshrinking view of human misery and the necessity of grace.",
    "strengths": [
      "Theological refusal to 'soften' the gospel or human sin.",
      "Clear identification of God as the sole actor in redemption (extra nos).",
      "Effective critique of the modern zeitgeist and 'highbrow' skepticism."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (under 20 minutes) to achieve required depth.",
      "Lack of explicit engagement with original biblical languages or rigorous exegesis.",
      "The specific 'uniqueness' of Ezekiel 37 is sometimes lost in general talk of 'myth' and 'faith'."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a substantial attempt at a sermon that takes both God and man seriously. However, according to Dekker's strict criteria, it remains a 'strong speech' that narrowly misses the formal definition of a sermon due to its brevity and lack of exegetical depth."
