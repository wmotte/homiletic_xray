Submit to him this day, with joy, and know in your heart that the words will sound for you as they did for that other sinner of Bethany so long ago: “Lazarus, come forth.” AMEN."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon centers on Ezekiel 37, but it treats the passage more as a representative of a 'central myth' than as a unique word that can be found nowhere else. The preacher correctly identifies the specificity of the 'dryness' and the 'exile,' but the sermon leans heavily on the general theme of resurrection found in John 11 and Paul's epistles.",
      "quotes": [
        "The lessons appointed for this fourth Sunday in Lent put the life-and-death themes of our faith before us in the most uncompromising fashion.",
        "The valley of bones represents the whole nation of Israel, the covenant community, gone hopelessly astray because of persistent idolatry."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more on the specific mechanics of Ezekiel’s vision—the command to prophesy to the breath vs. the bones—to find the unique 'Ezekielian' angle on God's sovereignty that differs from the Lazarus account."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher acknowledges the Babylonian exile and the communal nature of the 'bones' (the house of Israel). However, there is no evidence of engagement with the original languages or the specific theological structure of Ezekiel's book beyond a general 'poetic' reading.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ezekiel, like Revelation, requires that you not be literal-minded.",
        "This reflects a saying of the Hebrews in their Babylonian exile: 'Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off'."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the 'poetic imagination' to a more rigorous exegesis of the covenantal failure and the specific meaning of 'Ruach' (Spirit/Breath/Wind) in the Hebrew context."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the sermon's strongest point. The use of Jay McInerney’s memoir provides a concrete, contemporary bridge to the text. It avoids generalities by addressing specific cultural skepticism and the reality of death and guilt.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jay McInerney’s mother was terrified that her eternal destiny hung in the balance because of her betrayal of her husband.",
        "All the truly intelligent, urbane, sophisticated people are somewhere else this morning..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application doesn't rely solely on literary anecdotes; connect the 'dryness' more directly to the specific spiritual state of the local congregation in Connecticut."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon moves back and forth between the McInerney story and the Ezekiel text. While not strictly separated into 'lecture' and 'moral,' the transitions are sometimes more thematic than organic.",
      "quotes": [
        "What interests me today is its connection to the “central myth” and the message of Ezekiel.",
        "And so we come to the one passage in Ezekiel that almost everyone has heard about..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Try to let the text 'expound' the hearer simultaneously, rather than using the story as a parallel illustration of the text's themes."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon takes 'misery' (sin and death) very seriously, refusing to offer 'warm fuzzies.' Redemption is clearly placed outside of human merit. Gratitude is less explicitly developed but implied in the call to 'submit with joy.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Holding back on the bad news about our sinful condition is a sure way to rob the good news of its dazzlement.",
        "It is not for your sake... but for the sake of my holy name."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The 'gratitude' section (the third part) remains somewhat underdeveloped; the sermon ends on the miracle of life but could more clearly outline the life of service that follows."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher explicitly mentions the 'severity of God’s judgment' and the reality of being 'lost.' However, the sermon ultimately leans toward a more universalizing hope, potentially softening the 'two ways' toward the end.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ezekiel leaves us in no doubt about the inevitability and the severity of God’s judgment.",
        "She was in one sense right to be afraid. She knew she did not 'deserve' a free pass into eternal bliss."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Clarify the 'narrow way' as a contemporary call to decision, rather than just a theological category of God's judgment."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "The sermon is strongly Christocentric. Christ is the telos, and the preacher explicitly defends the doctrine of grace as something 'outside' human righteousness, which aligns perfectly with Dekker’s Barthian requirements.",
      "quotes": [
        "His righteousness reaches out and snatches us from the very jaws of death and brings us, undeserving as we are, into his eternal presence.",
        "Christ is the telos of the sermon... grace is the deepest of our life."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Maintain the distinction between the Spirit in Ezekiel and the Spirit in John more sharply to avoid collapsing the Old Testament's specific witness too quickly into the New."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 1,650 words, the sermon likely clocks in under 17 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for true depth.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section (Thesis 2) to provide the necessary 'breadth' to reach the 20-minute threshold."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a serious theological engagement that avoids the pitfalls of moralism and 'warm fuzzy' preaching. It falls short primarily in its brevity and its somewhat loose exegetical rigor regarding the Hebrew context of Ezekiel. It succeeds in making the 'misery' of the human condition concrete through modern literature and correctly identifies Christ and His grace as the only solution.",
    "strengths": [
      "Theologically sharp rejection of human-centered righteousness.",
      "Effective use of contemporary cultural markers (McInerney, New York Review of Books) to ground the sermon.",
      "Strong emphasis on the 'extra nos' (outside ourselves) nature of salvation."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (under 20 minutes) to achieve the 'breadth' Dekker demands.",
      "Exegesis is subordinated to 'poetic imagination' rather than rigorous study.",
      "The 'two ways' are mentioned but the sermon risks a soft landing that may diminish the urgency of the choice."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition regarding its substantive focus on the 'One Lord' and the 'Three Parts,' but it fails the formal requirement of length and the academic rigor of exposition. It is a strong speech, but a slightly underdeveloped sermon."
