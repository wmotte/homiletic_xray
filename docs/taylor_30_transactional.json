  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of 'Parental' preaching. While it aims for a theological 'Payoff' of grace, it achieves this by first systematically breaking down the listener's Adult ego through shaming and the induction of guilt. It relies on the Drama Triangle, casting the listener as the Persecutor of Christ and then as a helpless Victim of sin, with Christ/The Church as the Rescuer. This creates a cycle of dependency rather than an Adult-Adult encounter with the Divine.",

      "High emotional resonance and use of cultural 'Free Child' elements (Spirituals).",
      "Strong Adult-level observation of social hypocrisy."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Heavy reliance on shaming (Critical Parent).",
      "Lack of invitation for the listener to respond as a responsible, thinking Adult."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as 'fellow travelers' (Adult-Adult) rather than 'sinners in need of a lecture' (Parent-Child). Instead of telling them they are 'hideous,' ask questions that allow their own Adult to observe the reality of their lives and the invitation of grace."
