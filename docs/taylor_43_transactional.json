It identifies a common 'Game' played in churches (the 'Unworthiness' trap) and uses Adult-level linguistic analysis to dismantle it. By validating the real-world experience of economic and emotional 'insufficiency,' the preacher builds a bridge of empathy (Nurturing Parent) before offering a theological solution that promotes autonomy rather than dependency on religious 'boosters' or 'superstitions.'",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use Adult-to-Adult education to empower the congregation to read texts for themselves, as seen in the 'unworthy vs unworthily' section."
