    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in 'painting the picture' (Wilson). Taylor avoids abstract dogmatics by grounding the Palm Sunday narrative in sensory reality. He uses the 'optics' of the donkey, the 'tobacco-brown walls' of Jerusalem, and the 'screaming storm' to make the message visible. The imagery of the 'first streaker' (Isaiah) and the 'iron pan' provides a gritty, historical texture that prevents the sermon from becoming religious kitsch. The description of the Arc of Titus and the Roman soldiers riding into the Holy of Holies creates a cinematic climax that makes the 'Ichabod' moment palpable. The imagery is not merely decorative but serves as the primary vehicle for the theological weight of 'lost opportunity.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The tobacco-brown walls that still surround Jerusalem stand guard around her.",
        "Watch a screaming storm come lashing its way through a city, or go somewhere where a violent wind is blowing.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Taylor exhibits high stewardship of language (McEntyre). He avoids 'Canaanite jargon' in favor of a dignified, rhythmic prose that feels both timeless and urgent. His precision is most evident in the social commentary section, where he uses statistics and legal observations to ground the gospel in the 'New York' context. However, there is a slight tendency toward rhetorical expansion ('deteriorating process of age', 'debilitating and deteriorating') which, while rhythmic, occasionally sacrifices lean precision for oral effect. His word choice is deliberate, moving from the 'ludicrous' donkey to the 'apostate' city with surgical accuracy.",
      "quotes": [
        "What kind of twentieth-century smartness is it, and what kind of sophisticated wisdom is it...",
        "I do not know of five cases, in the history of this country, in which a white person has been executed for killing a black person.",

        "The 'tobacco-brown' descriptor is excellent but could be more precisely linked to the era's atmosphere.",
        "The transition between the capital punishment section and the 'lost opportunity' theme is somewhat abrupt."

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 9,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest aesthetic feature. Taylor utilizes the 'musicality of the Word' (Immink) through masterful parallelism and cadence. The use of anaphora ('In our risings and in our fallings...', 'Cares about...') creates a liturgical flow that carries the listener. The rhythm is not monotonous; it shifts from the staccato of the social critique to the legato of the final reflection on God's tears. The sermon is clearly composed for the ear, with a natural 'breath' in the sentence structure that facilitates oral delivery. It avoids 'paper language' entirely, sounding like a living performance even in text.",
      "quotes": [
        "In our risings and in our fallings, in our successes and in our failures, in our victories and in our defeats, in our joys and in our sorrows, in our laughter and in our tears.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The rhythm in the middle section on capital punishment is slightly more 'prosaic' than the surrounding sections.",
        "The 'If thou hadst known' refrain is powerful but could be varied slightly more in its third iteration.",
        "Ensure the 'Ah, boy, girl' section doesn't slip into a predictable sing-song cadence."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Pure oral language; the text breathes with the rhythm of a spoken event."
    },
    "average_score_language": 8.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is a sophisticated blend of high-rhetorical dignity and concrete, sensory detail. Taylor avoids the trap of 'beautifying writing' by ensuring that every rhythmic flourish serves the gravity of the 'lost opportunity' theme. His imagery is cinematic, particularly in the historical reconstructions of Jerusalem's fall. The musicality is exceptional, utilizing classical rhetorical devices to create a sense of inevitability and emotional resonance. It is a prime example of language stewardship where the form (rhythm/image) is the content (grace/judgment)."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry) that moves from the 'weird procession' of Palm Sunday to the 'awful word' of judgment, finally resting in the 'Savior's tears.' The 'upsetting of equilibrium' occurs early with the mystery of the donkey and the risk of violence. The turning point is the shift from the 'callous city' to the 'weeping God.' However, the lengthy excursion into capital punishment and racial injustice, while ethically powerful, creates a structural 'bulge' that momentarily stalls the narrative momentum of the Luke text before returning to the Mount of Olives.",
      "quotes": [
        "What an almost weird procession this would have been...",
        "I'd be willing to stop this sermon right now, if anybody is ready to stand up with some proof.",
        "There is but one other word to be spoken this morning... He beheld the city, and wept."

      "strengths": [
        "Strong opening that creates curiosity about the 'mystery' of the day.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The social commentary section on capital punishment feels like a 'sermon within a sermon' that disrupts the arc.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Taylor is a master of 'reframing' (Cilliers). He refuses to let Jerusalem remain a museum piece, constantly blurring the lines between 'old Jerusalem' and 'new New York.' The integration of the racial realities of the American legal system with the 'seething passions' of Roman-occupied Judea is a brilliant aesthetic move. He respects the 'strangeness' of the donkey and the prophets' drama while making them immediate. The sermon offers a new frame: the hearer is not just a spectator of a parade, but a citizen of a city currently facing its own 'day of visitation.'",
      "quotes": [
        "For the Roman soldiers in an occupied land were naturally skittish and nervous, and crowds are excitable.",
        "I do not know now whether I'm speaking about old Jerusalem or new New York.",
        "Our whole American culture... is dedicated to the improvement of every form of life... except our spirits."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Seamless 'reframing' of biblical nationalism into modern social justice.",
        "Honors the historical 'strangeness' of the text (the donkey, the drama).",
        "Direct application to the 'middle-aged man' and 'young woman' creates personal integration."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection between 'capital punishment' and 'Palm Sunday' is thematic (violence) but could be more exegetically grounded.",
        "The 'Ichabod' reference assumes a high level of biblical literacy in the hearer.",
        "Could explore the 'peace' mentioned in the text more deeply as a bridge between the two contexts."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing; the biblical text becomes a lens through which to view the American racial and spiritual crisis."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward a 'closed' structure in its moral warnings ('use the time'), yet remains 'open' (Stark) through the central image of the weeping Christ. By ending with the mystery of divine tears rather than a list of 'five things to do,' Taylor leaves space for the hearer to inhabit the 'between' (Cilliers) of judgment and grace. However, the social commentary section is quite 'monovalent'—it leaves little room for alternative interpretations of the data presented. The 'openness' is found in the existential questions about God's care, which are raised but left to resonate in the hearer's own experience of suffering.",
      "quotes": [
        "Where does nonviolence become violence? ... Well, we'll not settle that.",
        "If thou hadst known... but now.",
        "Does God care? ... It says to me yes, God cares."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The ending on 'hope' in 'tears' is an evocative, open image.",
        "Acknowledges the 'mystery' of the Palm Sunday arrangements.",
        "Leaves the question of 'God's care' as an invitation to personal experience."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'if thou hadst known' section can feel somewhat fatalistic/closed.",
        "The moralizing advice to 'boy, girl, teenager' is quite prescriptive.",
        "Could allow more room for the 'ambivalence' of the crowd's reaction."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly closed in its social/moral diagnosis, but aesthetically open in its final christological image."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon's structure is a sophisticated 'Homiletical Plot' that balances historical reconstruction with urgent contemporary application. While the narrative arc is occasionally strained by a lengthy (though powerful) social-ethical digression, it successfully returns to a profound emotional and theological climax. The integration of text and context is a masterclass in 'reframing,' making the ancient city of Jerusalem a mirror for modern New York. The movement from the 'weird' donkey to the 'weeping' Savior provides a satisfying and aesthetically rich journey."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Taylor avoids religious kitsch by refusing 'cheap comfort.' He sustains the 'pain of suffering' by vividly describing the destruction of Jerusalem and the reality of racial injustice. The 'happy ending' is not a shallow resolution but a 'lofty concept' found in tears. He distinguishes between 'sentiment' and 'emotion' by grounding God's care in the 'silent, inward weeping' at a tomb. There is no 'pre-chewed' emotion here; the tension of 'lost opportunity' is allowed to hurt before the 'Space for Grace' is opened. The use of the 'streaker' and the 'jackass' further de-sanitizes the narrative, protecting it from the 'pious kitsch' of typical Palm Sunday pageantry.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'sunny side of the street' metaphor is the closest the sermon comes to a clichéd sentiment.",
      "The 'sweet singer' and 'royal prophet' descriptions are slightly conventional."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The raw challenge to the congregation regarding the execution of black vs. white citizens.",
      "The description of God's intelligence matched against the 'little, dark, muddy corner of the cosmos'."

    "recommendation": "Maintain the gritty historical and social realism to continue grounding the high-rhetorical flourishes."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened primarily through the 'optics' of the weeping Christ. Taylor moves beyond 'moralization' (though it is present) to a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) where the 'Holy happens' in the encounter with a God who cares. He sustains the tension between the 'Ichabod' (glory departed) and the 'Hosanna' (save now). The mystery of God is respected; God is not 'explained' but 'witnessed' through the symmetry of nature and the empathy of the Savior. The sermon ends not with a task, but with a 'hope' situated in a 'concept of divinity' that is 'lifted by tears.'",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between the 'callous city' and the 'weeping Savior' is held until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'mystery' of the Palm Sunday arrangements and the 'beyond understanding' nature of God are explicitly stated.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the final third, though the middle section is heavily weighted toward moral/social imperative.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure the 'if thou hadst known' warning doesn't overshadow the 'but now' of grace's availability in the present moment."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the African American 'Prince of Preachers' style, characterized by rhythmic excellence and prophetic reframing. Taylor successfully navigates the 'aesthetic turn' by making the Word sensory and performative. The poetics of his language—specifically his use of cadence and vivid historical imagery—elevates the sermon far above a mere lecture. While the structural arc is slightly burdened by a social-ethical excursion, the integration of the 'then' and 'now' is executed with such rhetorical skill that it creates a powerful 'event' (Immink) for the hearer. The sermon avoids kitsch by embracing the 'terrible' nature of judgment and the 'brotherly' nature of divine sorrow. It opens a significant 'Space for Grace' by concluding with the image of a God whose power is most clearly seen in his tears. It is a work of 'sober beauty' that uses high rhetoric to serve a radical message of social and spiritual urgency.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful rhetorical rhythm and musicality (Domain A3).",
      "Prophetic reframing of biblical narrative into contemporary social crisis (Domain B2).",
      "Authentic emotional depth that avoids religious kitsch (Kitsch Diagnosis)."

      "Tighter structural integration of the social polemic into the narrative arc.",
      "Reduction of redundant 'doublet' phrasing to increase linguistic precision.",

    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Rhythmic (A blend of high-rhetorical cadence and social-realist imagery).",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson and the 'Reframing' phenomenology of Johan Cilliers.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who value both intellectual rigor (social critique) and emotional resonance (rhythmic litany).",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'open' metaphorical endings to allow the hearer more interpretive space.",
      "Utilize the 'Four Pages' structure to more evenly balance 'Trouble' and 'Grace' throughout the sermon.",
      "Read the text aloud to identify and prune 'paper language' redundancies."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically superior performance that demonstrates how form and content can be inseparably linked. Through the 'aesthetic turn,' Taylor transforms a familiar Palm Sunday text into a haunting and hopeful encounter with the 'weeping God.' Its primary achievement lies in its ability to be simultaneously a work of art and a prophetic witness, proving that 'sober beauty' can indeed carry the weight of both social judgment and divine grace."
