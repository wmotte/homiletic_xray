    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust, moving from a Nurturing Parent/Free Child invitation into an Adult assessment of social reality. It avoids the common trap of using religious dogma (Critical Parent) to shame the listener. Instead, it uses the 'Mystery of Infancy' to validate the listener's desire for a 'fresh start,' promoting psychological growth and autonomy. The transition to 'iniquity' is handled as a reality-check (Adult) rather than a shaming tactic.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong activation of the Free Child's capacity for wonder.",
      "Healthy Nurturing Parent that encourages hope without creating dependency.",
      "Balanced view of reality (Adult) that includes both joy and social suffering."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The shift to 'making war' against sin could be softened to avoid a sudden Critical Parent 'must' which might trigger the Adapted Child's guilt.",
      "More Adult-to-Adult dialogue on *how* to address the disparities mentioned."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' ego state to connect the 'Mystery' to concrete actions, ensuring the call to justice feels like a choice made by a free agent rather than a 'must' imposed by a Critical Parent."
