    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "While theologically sophisticated and rhetorically engaging, the sermon is psychologically regressive. it utilizes a 'Critical Parent' framework to create a 'siege mentality' in the listeners. By framing secular intellectualism as a symptom of 'rebellion' and 'superiority,' the preacher discourages Adult-Adult dialogue with the world. The call to 'believe in order to understand' functions as a mechanism to bypass the listener's critical faculties, fostering dependency on the preacher’s interpretation of 'the Word.'",

      "Dismissal of the Adult ego's need for reality-testing and objective inquiry."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the secular critique as a valid 'Adult' challenge rather than 'Childish rebellion.' Invite the congregation to hold their faith and their intellectual doubts in a tension that promotes growth rather than demanding the 'suspension of disbelief' as a prerequisite for belonging."
