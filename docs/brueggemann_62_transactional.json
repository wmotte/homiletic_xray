        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "Coercion is largely absent; instead, the preacher critiques the 'small-minded moral scrupulousness' of the CP. However, there is a subtle 'must' regarding the need to learn the second language of praise.",

    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a rare example of psychologically healthy homiletics. It uses the Adult ego state to dismantle the toxic Critical Parent/Adapted Child dynamic often found in religious settings. By validating the listener's 'integrity' (Adult/FC) before introducing the 'mystery' of God, it avoids the shame-based manipulation typical of 'Bait & Switch' sermons. It promotes what TA calls 'Autonomy'—the capacity for awareness, spontaneity, and intimacy.",

      "Validation of the listener's reality and integrity.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the 'Rich Young Ruler' could be seen as a slight 'Switch' to a more demanding Parent position.",
      "The term 'submission' carries heavy AC baggage and could be further clarified to ensure it isn't heard as 'knuckling under'."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' language to maintain Adult-Adult parity. Ensure that the 'yielding' described is presented as a Free Child's response to beauty, rather than an Adapted Child's response to overwhelming power."
