  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is a sophisticated example of 'Bait and Switch.' It begins with an Adult-to-Adult intellectual exploration of light, which builds trust. It then switches to a Critical Parent-to-Adapted Child transaction, using a 'diagnostic' phase to induce guilt. While the final 'payoff' is intended to be the 'beauty of grace,' the psychological path to get there relies on making the listener feel small and incompetent. This creates a dependency on the preacher's 'Rescuer' narrative rather than fostering true Adult autonomy.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of Adult ego position for logical clarity.",
      "Engages the Free Child through poetic and aesthetic language.",
      "Clear, non-smothering Nurturing Parent in the teaching sections."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Avoid 'mind-reading' the congregation's motives (e.g., 'You won't do this because...').",
      "Reduce the 'Critical Parent' diagnostic traps that force listeners into 'Adapted Child' shame."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Instead of telling the audience they are 'dirty' or 'not growing,' present the 'Adult' data and allow the listener to perform their own self-assessment. Replace 'I would submit the light hasn't come on' with 'One might ask themselves if the light has come on,' respecting the listener's autonomy."
