A few weeks ago I had to preach a funeral sermon to [...] Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I, the Lord, have rebuilt the ruined places, and replanted that which was desolate; I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will do it. AMEN."

    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on a specific Bible passage. It treats Ezekiel as a collection of themes (Word of God, sending, story-telling) rather than a single pericope. By jumping from chapter 1 to 36, it loses the specificity Dekker demands. It treats the Bible as a 'prodigious story' rather than recreating a specific text into a current word.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you can show me anything else in world literature like the book of Ezekiel, I would like to see it.",
        "The entire Bible is founded upon these words: 'Thus says the Lord God.'",

      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one specific pericope (e.g., 2:1-7) and find what is unique to that encounter that cannot be found elsewhere in the Bible, rather than using it to illustrate general Barthian dogmatics."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is a basic awareness of the original context (exiles in Babylon), but it is used more as a backdrop for a literary or psychological discussion than a rigorous linguistic or historical exposition. The mention of 'son of man' vs 'mortal' is a footnote rather than a driver of the sermon's movement.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ezekiel speaks during the mournful time when the people were in exile in pagan Babylon.",
        "In Ezekiel, 'son of man' simply means 'human being.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exposition of the Hebrew 'Ben-Adam' within the specific context of the priestly Ezekiel's call, rather than pivoting immediately to Freud or Barth."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the 'zeitgeist' of New York City and the feeling of intellectual superiority among secular elites. This aligns with Dekker's requirement for knowledge of cultural philosophy and psychology. However, it risks becoming a general speech about 'secularism' rather than an application of the specific Ezekiel text.",
      "quotes": [
        "The polite silence of many of my secular friends... is actually a mask... for their feelings of superiority.",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured as a series of reflections on the concept of 'The Word' rather than an interwoven movement where the hearer is 'expounded' by the text. The application to the NYC context feels like a frame around the text rather than something emerging from the inner movement of the exegesis.",
      "quotes": [
        "For all of us who recognize this situation... the book of the prophet Ezekiel has a message.",
        "Tonight, you hear the voice of One speaking."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Misery is present in the form of 'rebelliousness' and the 'heart of stone.' Redemption is found in the 'new heart' and 'new spirit.' However, the misery is somewhat intellectualized as 'secular resistance' rather than the deep ontological misery before God that Dekker/Heidelberg Catechism envision.",

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on 'rebellion' and 'refusing to hear,' but it lacks the 'seriousness of the destination' Dekker demands. The possibility of being truly lost (temporally or eternally) is softened by the focus on the 'power of the story.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Whether they hear or refuse to hear... they will know that there has been a prophet among them.",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "While the sermon mentions 'bearing witness to Jesus Christ,' Christ is not the telos of the specific Ezekiel passages as they are handled. He is an add-on at the beginning and end, rather than the goal toward which the specific text moves.",
      "quotes": [
        "I find these words very comforting as I go about my work of bearing witness to Jesus Christ.",
        "In these words, your eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1650 words, the sermon would likely take 16-17 minutes. According to Dekker's Thesis 8, a sermon under 20 minutes cannot achieve the necessary depth. The breadth of the text (chapters 1 to 36) further compromises depth.",
      "improvement_point": "Increase the length to at least 20 minutes by narrowing the textual focus and deepening the theological and psychological 'boring' into a single passage."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily due to its lack of textual specificity and insufficient length. It functions more as a thematic lecture on the 'Word of God' using Ezekiel as an illustration rather than an exposition of a specific pericope. While it shows a strong grasp of the 'zeitgeist' (Thesis 3), it fails to let the specific text say what can be found 'nowhere else.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective use of humanities (Freud, psychology) to diagnose the contemporary hearer's spiritual state.",
      "Clear Barthian foundation regarding the priority of God's speech."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Textual fragmentation: jumping across 36 chapters prevents specific exposition.",
      "Insufficient duration: fails the 20-minute threshold for depth.",
      "Lack of 'Two Ways' urgency: the consequences of rebellion are not sharply defined."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate religious address with strong cultural observations, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense because it lacks pericope-specificity and the required breadth for depth."
