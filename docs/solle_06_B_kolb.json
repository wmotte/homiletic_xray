      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon lacks a primary 'slice of life' or immediate personal experience for the local hearer. It operates on a global-political level. While it mentions Soweto and school children, these remain historical-geographical references rather than immersive experiences. The emotional connection is intellectualized through the lens of solidarity rather than felt through narrative empathy.",

      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher pauses to ask 'why' and 'for whom,' challenging the standard interpretation of 'for all.' It offers a sharp cultural and ideological critique of 'normal exegesis' and 'bourgeois' tricks. It forces the hearer to look at the text from the perspective of the 'other.'",

        "Für wen ist ein Text geschrieben worden? Wer fand sich in einer bestimmten Passage repräsentiert?",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a clear 'big idea': the gospel is partisan and class-specific. However, actual biblical exegesis is thin; the preacher assumes the text is known and moves immediately to systematic-theological application. The logic is deductive and grounded in Liberation Theology frameworks rather than a fresh discovery from the biblical text itself.",

It operates almost exclusively in the realm of reflection and abstraction. It lacks a grounding in the concrete, lived experience of the immediate congregation and fails to provide specific, actionable steps for the 'active experimentation' phase. The language is academic and sociological, which serves the 'Assimilating' learner well but leaves the 'Accommodating' and 'Converging' learners without a clear path forward. It is a strong theological essay, but a structurally unbalanced sermon.",

    "conclusion": "The sermon is a potent example of 'Prophetic Discernment' (Osmer) and 'Declarative' preaching (Anderson). It successfully deconstructs bourgeois hermeneutics but fails to reconstruct a holistic learning path for the hearer. Its primary value lies in its intellectual provocation. To become a more effective instrument of transformation, it must move beyond the 'Head' and 'Eyes' to engage the 'Heart' and 'Hands' through narrative and concrete application. It is a high-quality theological lecture, but a mediocre experiential learning event."
