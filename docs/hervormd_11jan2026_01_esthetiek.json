    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes the biblical imagery of the wedding at Kana effectively but stays largely within the bounds of the text's own metaphors. There is a clear attempt to 'show' the abundance of the wine and the transformation of the purification jars. However, the sensory depth is somewhat limited; we hear about the 'stench' or 'taste' only by implication. The preacher successfully connects the 'small piece of bread' to the 'wedding of the Lamb,' creating a bridge between the physical elements on the table and the eschatological vision. The imagery of the 'pubescent son' taking distance is a rare moment of modern psychological imaging that adds a human layer, though it remains brief. Overall, the imagery is functional and clear but lacks the 'surprising' or 'fresh' quality that Cilliers or Wilson advocate for higher scores.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' typical of the Reformed tradition. There is a high degree of stewardship of language (McEntyre); words are chosen with theological precision. The preacher avoids excessive 'Canaanite' jargon, or where used (e.g., 'teken en zegel'), it is placed within a clear liturgical framework. The distinction between the 'mother' as a person and as a symbol of the 'synagogue' is handled with intellectual care. The sentence structure is balanced, avoiding the 'sloppy thinking' Grözinger warns against. However, the language remains somewhat safe and conventional, lacking the poetic 'edge' that would elevate it to an 8.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a steady, rhythmic flow suitable for a liturgical setting. There is a noticeable use of parallelism and short, punchy sentences that create a sense of invitation ('Kom, kom...'). The cadence is meditative, which fits the 'Avondmaal' context. However, it occasionally falls into 'paper language,' particularly in the middle sections where the exegesis becomes more explanatory. The rhythm is predictable—a 'legato' of reflection—without enough 'staccato' moments of action or surprise to truly grip the ear. It is pleasant but not musically compelling.",

    "summary_language": "The language of the sermon is characterized by clarity, theological precision, and a respectful, sober aesthetic. It avoids the pitfalls of 'kitsch' by remaining grounded in the biblical text and the liturgical moment. While the imagery is functional and the rhythm is steady, the poetics remain somewhat conventional. It is a 'safe' aesthetic that prioritizes communication over artistic provocation. The 'stewardship of language' is high, but the 'poetic power' is moderate."

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with the 'equilibrium' of the table, introduces the 'upsetting' problem (the wine is gone), and moves toward the 'turning point' where Jesus transforms the water. The preacher successfully maintains tension by exploring the 'strangeness' of Jesus' response to his mother. The movement from the 'first-century wedding' to the 'eternal wedding' provides a sense of progression. The energy is sustained until the final invitation, which serves as the resolution. It is not a static three-point sermon but a dynamic journey through the text.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in 'reframing' (Cilliers). It takes the ancient text of Kana and frames the current 'Avondmaal' table through it. The preacher avoids a simple 'moral of the story' and instead invites the congregation to see their own reality (their doubts, their 'lack of wine') in the light of Jesus' abundance. The connection between the 'Galilee of the nations' and the 'inclusive table' is a creative synthesis that respects the text's strangeness while making it contemporary. The 'reframing' of the purification jars as 'vessels of joy' is the aesthetic highlight of the structure.",
      "quotes": [
        "Deze bruiloft helpt ons op weg om het feest van Jezus te begrijpen.",

      "reframing_present": "The sermon offers a new frame: the table is not a place of 'purification' but a 'wedding feast' of abundance."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is largely an 'open work of art' (Stark) in its conclusion, inviting the hearer to the table regardless of their state. It acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (doubt, sin). However, the exegetical sections are somewhat 'closed'—the preacher provides the symbolic meaning (Mother = Synagogue) rather than letting the polyvalence of the image work on the hearer. The 'answers' are provided quite quickly. While the invitation is open, the interpretation of the text feels somewhat 'sealed' by traditional dogmatic categories.",
      "quotes": [
        "Het beeld dat wij van Jezus hebben is altijd te klein.",
        "Mogen wij vol verwondering kijken waar Hij ons brengt.",

      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Leave more room for the hearer to interpret the 'mother' figure before providing the 'synagogue' label.",
        "End some sections with questions rather than explanations to increase polyvalence.",
        "Allow the 'silence' of the bride and groom in the text to speak more to the hearer's own hiddenness."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "A mix: the theological application is open, but the exegetical interpretation is relatively monovalent."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is strong, particularly in its narrative movement and reframing. The sermon avoids a static structure and instead creates a 'happening' (Immink) where the biblical story flows into the liturgical celebration. The integration of text and context is the sermon's greatest structural strength. While the interpretation is somewhat traditional and 'closed' in parts, the overall arc is one of opening space for the hearer to encounter the 'sovereign Jesus'."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'pre-chewed' emotions and 'happy endings' that ignore the 'pain of suffering.' The preacher explicitly mentions the 'hard' distance Jesus takes from his mother and the 'earnestness' of the table. There is no manipulative sentimentality; the joy described is a 'theological joy' rooted in the 'hour' of the cross. By sustaining the tension of the 'not yet' and the 'sovereignty' of Jesus, the sermon maintains authentic aesthetic depth.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None identified; the sermon avoids clichéd 'Jesus is your best friend' language.",
      "The 'pubescent son' metaphor borders on being a modern cliché but is used here to emphasize 'hardness' rather than sentiment."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The acknowledgment that 'our image of Jesus is always too small.'",
      "The focus on the 'hard' distance between Jesus and his tradition."

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a textbook example of 'opening space for grace' (Cilliers). It systematically deconstructs 'moralization' and 'legalism' (the purification jars) and replaces them with the 'unavailable' gift of wine. The emphasis on Jesus' sovereignty—that he is not in our power—creates a 'space' where God can truly be God. The final invitation is a pure proclamation of grace that requires no human 'work.'",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'old tradition' and the 'new wine' is well-sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of Jesus' identity and his 'hour' is respected and not over-explained.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails completely; moralization is explicitly rejected in the conclusion.",

  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically coherent and theologically sound 'event.' Its primary strength lies in its 'Reframing'—the ability to take a well-known biblical narrative and use it to transform the congregation's perception of the Lord's Supper. It moves from a 'closed' ritual of purification to an 'open' feast of grace. While the language is sober and lacks high poetic ornamentation, its 'stewardship' and precision provide a solid foundation for the 'holy to happen.' The sermon avoids the trap of religious kitsch by honoring the 'hardness' of Jesus' words and the 'gravity' of the cross. It successfully creates a 'Space for Grace' by emphasizing the sovereignty of Christ over human tradition and religious effort. The narrative arc is effective, leading the hearer from a 'problem' of lack to the 'abundance' of the Kingdom.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Theological 'Reframing' of purification jars into vessels of grace.",
      "Authentic, non-kitsch tone that respects the 'hardness' of the Gospel.",
      "Strong narrative integration of the biblical text with the liturgical moment."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase sensory imagery ('Show, don't tell') to create a more cinematic experience.",
      "Vary the rhythmic cadence to avoid a monotonous meditative flow.",
      "Allow for more interpretive 'openness' in the exegetical sections."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed with a Narrative-Reframing core.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Gerrit Immink (Performance of the Sacrament).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to hearers who value theological depth, liturgical order, and a 'quiet' but radical proclamation of grace.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more vivid, 'earthy' metaphors for human need.",
      "Use more 'staccato' rhetorical moments to punctuate key turning points.",
      "Trust the images to speak for themselves before explaining their symbolic meaning."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a strong example of contemporary Reformed homiletics that has successfully navigated the 'aesthetic turn.' It prioritizes the 'beauty of simplicity' and the 'power of the Word' over superficial decoration. By focusing on the 'event' of grace and the 'reframing' of reality, it achieves a high level of aesthetic integrity. It is a '7'—a very good, effective sermon that serves as a reliable vehicle for the 'Space for Grace,' though it stops short of the poetic virtuosity required for an 8 or 9."
