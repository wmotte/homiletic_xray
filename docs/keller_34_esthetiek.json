    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily as a pedagogical tool rather than a poetic immersion. Keller employs 'functional imagery'—the surgeon’s scalpel, the Internet fraud, the father picking up the son—to clarify abstract concepts of revelation and assurance. While effective for comprehension, the imagery lacks the 'thick' sensory texture advocated by Paul Scott Wilson. The biblical world is not 'painted' in vivid detail; rather, it is explained. The shekinah glory is mentioned but remains more of a theological category than a sensory experience for the hearer. The 'show, don't tell' balance tips toward 'telling' the meaning of images rather than letting the images speak for themselves.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Word of God... goes right down like a surgeon’s scalpel.",
        "The shekinah glory cloud that nobody could stand in front of... the brilliance and the superlativeness.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Keller exhibits high stewardship of language, consistent with McEntyre’s criteria. He avoids 'Canaanite' jargon by defining terms (e.g., 'polymeros', 'polytropos', 'shekinah') or translating them into contemporary psychological categories like 'significance' and 'self-worth'. His word choice is precise, particularly when distinguishing between 'indentured servanthood' and 'chattel slavery'. The language is economical; there is little 'fluff'. He nuances human experience—such as the Saturday night anxiety of the preacher—with a precision that avoids platitudes. This precision serves the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed tradition, where clarity is an aesthetic virtue.",
      "quotes": [
        "Polymeros means at many times, but polytropos... actually means piecemeal, in pieces.",
        "He who through preaching is righteous shall die a thousand deaths every Saturday night.",
        "It is not only a misconstrual but a reductionistic and, frankly, misleading thing to say the Bible condones slavery."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent translation of theological concepts into contemporary psychological vocabulary.",
        "High degree of nuance in handling sensitive historical/cultural topics.",

        "Could utilize more varied vocabulary beyond the 'significance/self-worth' loop."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Theological jargon is present but always 'unpacked' for a secular or skeptical audience, making it accessible without losing depth."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is clearly 'oral language', but it leans toward the didactic rather than the poetic. The rhythm is that of a lecture or a persuasive conversation. There is a frequent use of staccato sentences for emphasis ('God speaks. God speaks immediately.'), which creates a sense of urgency. However, the musicality is limited; there is little use of alliteration, assonance, or varied cadence that would elevate the prose to a 'musical' event. It is 'paper language' in the sense that it is highly structured and logical, though the delivery (performance) likely softens this. It lacks the 'legato' of contemplative reflection.",
      "quotes": [
        "God speaks. God speaks immediately. God speaks penetratingly.",
        "Lay your deadly doing down / Down at Jesus’ feet.",

      "strengths": [
        "Strong use of repetition for rhetorical emphasis.",

        "Increase the use of rhetorical figures like parallelism to enhance memorability.",
        "Vary sentence length more intentionally to create a more 'musical' ebb and flow.",
        "Incorporate more poetic passages to balance the heavy didactic sections."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Oral language, but specifically 'didactic-oral'. It sounds like a teacher, not a poet."
    },
    "average_score_language": 6.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by exceptional clarity and intellectual precision, serving a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic. Keller excels at 'stewardship of language' by translating ancient concepts into modern idioms without losing theological weight. However, the poetics are secondary to the logic. Imagery is functional rather than immersive, and the rhythm is more argumentative than musical. It is a language of 'convincing' rather than 'enchanting'. The aesthetic power lies in the 'aha!' moment of a well-turned explanation rather than the 'wow' of a beautiful image."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' as described by Lowry. It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium'—the cultural objection that the Bible is obsolete. This creates a tension that the rest of the sermon seeks to resolve. The movement is not a static three-point list but a journey from 'Problem' (Is the Bible outdated?) to 'Theological Solution' (Christ as final word) to 'Personal Application' (The Word as living power). The 'turning point' occurs when Keller shifts from defending the Bible's status to describing the experience of the Word's power in his own life. The energy remains high because the stakes—personal relationship with God—are clearly defined.",
      "quotes": [
        "How do we respond to that? Well, the place to go... is the book of Hebrews.",
        "I’ve seen innumerable situations like that as a pastor, but here’s what I want you to know.",
        "The reason I’m not going to stop there is this. Some of you are disappointed."

      "strengths": [
        "Clear movement from external cultural objections to internal spiritual reality.",
        "Effective use of 'objection-handling' to maintain intellectual tension.",
        "The personal anecdote about the Saturday night 'thousand deaths' serves as a powerful dramatic climax."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition between the 'apologetic' section (slavery/polygamy) and the 'experiential' section is somewhat abrupt.",
        "The conclusion could be more 'open'; it returns quickly to a summary of the points.",
        "The 'three parts' are announced early, which can sometimes make the journey feel too 'mapped out'."

      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey that uses an apologetic framework to create a narrative of discovery."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest aesthetic feature. Keller masters Cilliers' 'reframing'. He takes the 'strangeness' of Hebrews (sacrifices, high priests, 'piecemeal' revelation) and reframes it within the modern search for 'significance' and 'self-worth'. The synthesis between the ancient text and the contemporary context (Internet fraud, bankruptcy law, psychological anxiety) feels organic. He respects the text's historical distance while showing its immediate relevance. He doesn't just 'apply' the text; he uses the text to provide a new lens through which the hearer views their own restlessness and cultural assumptions.",
      "quotes": [
        "In the Old Testament slavery was what we today would call a form of bankruptcy law.",
        "We’re all looking for significance. We all want self-worth... but what are we doing?",
        "If you leave things out of the Bible that offend you, how will God ever be able to offend you?"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of the concept of 'righteousness' as 'self-worth'.",
        "Honest engagement with 'hard' texts (slavery) rather than smoothing them over.",
        "The context of modern skepticism is used as a foil to highlight the text's radicality."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could explore the 'context' of the original Hebrews audience more to show the parallel in their 'restlessness'.",
        "The 'reframing' of slavery, while intellectually satisfying, could be more empathetically grounded.",
        "Ensure the 'reframing' doesn't become too predictable (always moving to psychological categories)."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes. It successfully reframes the Bible from a 'rulebook to be updated' to a 'living voice that confronts and heals'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward 'closedness' in its logic but 'openness' in its invitation. As an 'open work of art' (Stark), it is somewhat monovalent; Keller has a very specific interpretation he wants the hearer to accept. The logic is 'sealed'—if A, then B. However, the sermon opens up in the final third, where the 'mystery' of God's love is presented. By admitting his own struggle with motives, Keller creates a space for the hearer to step into their own ambivalence. The ending is a prayer that invites rather than a moralistic 'must' that commands, though the path to that invitation is strictly paved with logical propositions.",
      "quotes": [
        "I’m not saying God doesn’t lead you like that. I’m just saying you can’t be sure.",
        "Are you saying that God can’t speak today? ... I don’t think you know what you’re talking about.",
        "Father... help us to accept your Word even where it offends us."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The personal confession of the preacher creates an 'entry point' for the hearer's own failure.",
        "The 'openness' to God's unpredictable 'piercing' of the heart.",
        "The final invitation to 'behold the glory' is an aesthetic call to wonder."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'objection-answer' format can feel like a closed courtroom drama; leave more room for the 'unanswered'.",
        "The tone can occasionally feel 'corrective' ('I don't think you know what you're talking about'), which may close the hearer off.",
        "Allow for more polyphony—different ways the 'Word' might sound to different people."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent in its teaching, but polyvalent in its experiential invitation."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is expertly crafted to lead a modern skeptic from intellectual resistance to spiritual surrender. The structure is dynamic, utilizing a 'problem-resolution' arc that keeps the hearer engaged. The integration of text and context is a masterclass in 'reframing', making ancient Hebrew categories feel like modern psychological necessities. While the logical structure is 'closed' and authoritative, the experiential climax provides enough 'space' for the hearer to encounter the 'Holy' as an event. It is a structure that prioritizes 'persuasion' as a path to 'encounter'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. Keller avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by speaking honestly about the 'thousand deaths' of ministry and the 'scary' nature of God's all-seeing eye. He rejects 'sentiment' (pre-chewed emotions) in favor of 'authentic emotion' grounded in the 'piercing' of the Word. The comfort offered is not 'cheap'; it is only accessible through the 'pain' of being 'uncovered and laid bare'. He specifically warns against 'deifying' natural feelings (the Whitefield example), which is a direct critique of kitsch. The depth is found in the 'sober' reality of the cross.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The father/son story is on the edge of kitsch, but is saved by its specific theological application to Romans 8.",
      "The 'magic thing' reading of the Bible is mentioned only to be rejected."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The confession of 'dying a thousand deaths' due to prideful motives.",
      "The stark description of being 'pierced' by the law: 'it slew me'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Continue to lean into the 'piercing' and 'uncovering' aspects of the text to prevent the 'grace' sections from becoming overly sentimental."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'reframing' of the human condition as one of 'restlessness' and 'deadly doing'. By sustaining the tension of the 'account' we must give to God, Keller makes the 'Sabbath-rest' of Christ feel like a genuine opening of space. However, the highly logical, apologetic 'framing' of the first half of the sermon can feel 'crowded' with arguments, potentially leaving less space for the 'unavailable' mystery. The 'Space for Grace' is most palpable in the final section where the focus shifts from 'the Bible' as a document to 'Jesus' as a beautiful, pierced Savior.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between 'God's sight' and 'our hearts' is sustained until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "Partially. While God's love is treated as a mystery, the 'mechanics' of revelation are explained quite thoroughly.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. The sermon explicitly rejects 'deadly doing' and moralism in favor of 'resting' in Christ's finished work.",
    "recommendation": "Allow for more silence or 'wordless' moments in the prose to let the 'Space for Grace' breathe without immediate logical explanation."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of the 'Sober-Reformed' style, where beauty is found in the clarity of truth and the precision of 'reframing'. It avoids the 'visual excess' of kitsch and the 'vertical' coldness of pure dialectical theology by grounding the 'Word' in the human experience of restlessness and the psychological need for significance. The poetics are functional, serving the larger dramaturgical goal of moving the hearer from skepticism to adoration. The sermon's aesthetic power lies in its 'transparency'—the preacher uses language not to draw attention to his own 'art', but to 'show' the beauty of Christ. While it lacks the high-poetic 'musicality' of some traditions, its 'stewardship of language' and 'dramaturgical arc' create a compelling 'event' where the 'holy happens' through the medium of clear, persuasive speech.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of ancient theological categories for a modern audience.",
      "Authentic, anti-kitsch engagement with the preacher's own spiritual struggle.",
      "Clear, dynamic narrative arc that sustains intellectual and emotional tension."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase sensory 'imagery' to move beyond functional analogies.",
      "Enhance the 'musicality' and rhythmic variety of the prose.",
      "Create more 'open space' by reducing the density of logical argumentation in the first half."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Apologetic-Experiential",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Form follows Text' of Thomas Long (Hebrews' high-christological argument is mirrored in the sermon's structure).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals most to 'The Skeptical Intellectual' and 'The Restless Achiever' who value clarity, honesty, and logical coherence over emotional sentimentality.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'Show, Don't Tell' by describing a biblical scene for 2 minutes without explaining its meaning.",
      "Use more varied sentence structures to create a more 'legato' feel in the reflective sections.",
      "Incorporate a 'moment of silence' or an 'open question' at the end to increase the 'Opera Aperta' quality."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically successful 'event' that honors the Reformed emphasis on the 'Word' while embracing the 'Aesthetic Turn' through its focus on perception and reframing. It avoids the pitfalls of kitsch and moralism, opening a genuine 'Space for Grace' by pointing to the 'unsurpassable beauty' of Christ. Its primary aesthetic achievement is the translation of 'Dogma' into 'Drama'—making the finality of the Bible not a static truth to be defended, but a living voice to be encountered."
