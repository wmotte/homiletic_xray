  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses 2 Samuel 12 as a primary narrative, but it fails Dekker's test of finding what is 'NOWHERE else in the Bible.' Instead of mining the specific literary or theological depth of the Nathan-David encounter, the preacher treats it as a general illustration of 'accountability' and 'confession.' The inclusion of Elijah, Jeremiah, and general New Testament parables dilutes the specificity of the chosen text.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is not really a sermon about the President after all. This is a sermon about you and me.",
        "The Bible shows us in a thousand different ways that God’s judgment is an instrument of his mercy."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus exclusively on the unique psychological and theological trap Nathan sets for David. Avoid jumping to other prophets to prove a general 'biblical theme' of accountability."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is largely replaced by storytelling. There is no evidence of the 'Hebrew and Greek' requirement or a deep dive into the theology of the Books of Samuel. The historical context of Israel's kingship vs. prophetic office is touched upon but remains superficial, serving the contemporary analogy rather than the text's own world.",
      "quotes": [
        "King David has committed adultery with Bathsheba... David, like various presidents of the United States, contrives to cover up his sin."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Examine the specific covenantal implications of David's sin in the context of the Davidic promise, rather than treating it as a moral failure analogous to modern politics."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the 'zeitgeist' (the Clinton scandal and the role of the media), which Dekker values. However, it risks becoming a 'speech about refugees' (or in this case, presidents) rather than a sermon. The transition to the hearer's life at the end becomes somewhat general ('marriage', 'human relationships').",
      "quotes": [
        "Jay Leno plays the role of national exorcist every night...",
        "What really makes the difference in human relationships — especially in marriage — is a readiness to admit fault."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the application to the congregation as specific as the application to the President. Move beyond 'being sorry' to the specific 'misery' of the hearer's own 'hidden' sins."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured as a commentary on a newspaper article, followed by a retelling of the Bible story, followed by a moral conclusion. While the contemporary context is woven throughout, the 'exposition' and 'application' feel like parallel tracks rather than a single movement where the text 'expounds' the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "I’m taking off from another newspaper column sent me by my sister.",
        "So this is not really a sermon about the President after all. This is a sermon about you and me."

      "improvement_point": "Start with the text's own movement and let the contemporary situation be judged by the text, rather than using the text to comment on the situation."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'misery' (sin/failure) and 'redemption' (forgiveness/grace) are present. However, the 'misery' is somewhat softened by the term 'human frailty,' which the preacher critiques but then partially adopts by calling everyone 'fellow bad characters.' Redemption is clearly outside the self ('pardoning our offences').",
      "quotes": [
        "Bad characters are the only kind of characters God has to work with...",
        "His purpose toward you is unconditionally loving. That is the foundation on which we stand."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect. David’s sin wasn't just 'frailty'; it was a calculated abuse of power and murder. The sermon should reflect that gravity to make grace more 'urgent'."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon avoids the 'seriousness of being lost.' While it mentions 'judgment,' it immediately softens it as a 'course correction.' The possibility of 'temporal loss' (society perishing) is hinted at regarding political accountability, but the 'narrow way' vs. 'broad way' is not a sharp edge here.",
      "quotes": [
        "Judgment does not mean everlasting condemnation, as we are conditioned to think; it means a course correction..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the reality that David *could* have been lost. The 'two ways' require a real possibility of destruction, not just a 'correction' in the context of 'unconditional love'."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned at the beginning and the very end, but he is not the 'telos' (goal) that the entire sermon moves toward. He appears more as a theological necessity to wrap up the argument about forgiveness rather than the living Lord through whom the text is unlocked.",
      "quotes": [
        "...the only person that can forgive sins committed against others — the Son of God himself.",
        "...the Lord Jesus Christ himself was called the Son of David."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Integrate the 'Two Natures' more robustly. How does Christ, as the true King, fulfill what David destroyed? Make Christ the necessity of the sermon, not just the conclusion."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 18 minutes (1850 words), the sermon falls just short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. This lack of 'breadth' results in a somewhat hurried transition from the political scandal to the personal application, sacrificing 'depth' in the exegesis.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section (Thesis 2) to provide the 'breadth' required for theological 'depth'."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s ideal primarily because it functions more as a moral-political commentary than a rigorous 'exposition and application' of a specific text. It relies heavily on contemporary anecdotes (Clinton, Billy Graham, Cal Thomas) and uses the Bible as a source of supporting illustrations rather than the generative Word. The exegesis is thin, and the 'Two Ways' are significantly softened by an emphasis on 'unconditional love' that lacks the sharp edge of biblical judgment.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong awareness of the 'zeitgeist' and the courage to address contemporary moral crises directly.",
      "Clear articulation of grace as something 'outside' human merit (Thesis 7).",
      "Effective use of narrative to engage the listener's attention."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specific, text-grounded exegesis; the sermon could have been preached without 2 Samuel 12 by using almost any other story of sin.",
      "Softening of 'misery' and 'judgment' into 'frailty' and 'course correction,' undermining the seriousness of the 'Two Ways'.",
      "Insufficient length to achieve the 'depth' Dekker demands."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an engaging religious speech, but according to Dekker’s strict formal definition, it is not yet a 'sermon.' It lacks the specific 'NOWHERE else' quality of the biblical text and prioritizes 'access' to the political conversation over the 'recreation' of the written Word into a new, current, proclamatory word."
