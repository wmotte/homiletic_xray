    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes strong, evocative imagery to ground abstract theological shifts. The metaphor of 'snakes in a sheet' provides a visceral starting point, while the recurring image of 'wagons in a circle' effectively communicates a defensive, closed posture. Brueggemann (or the author) uses the 'two pots in the kitchen' anecdote to provide a tactile, domestic image of religious scrupulosity. The imagery serves the 'show, don't tell' principle by making the resistance to change feel physical rather than just intellectual. However, the imagery remains largely focused on the 'trouble' (the walled city) rather than painting a vivid picture of the 'grace' or the 'new territory' mentioned at the end.",

    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is precise in its choice of verbs—'haunted,' 'shattered,' 'shred,' 'tremble.' There is a clear stewardship of words that aim to disrupt. However, the sermon occasionally slips into contemporary socio-political shorthand ('a Black or a gay') which, while aiming for inclusivity, can feel like a list of categories rather than nuanced human experiences. The term 'othering' is used in a slightly idiosyncratic way (meaning 'embracing the other' rather than the sociological 'marginalizing the other'), which might cause brief confusion. The precision is highest when deconstructing the 'hegemonic governance' of the tradition.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jerusalem is a safe, honored place of well-being and certitude.",
        "A foundation-shaking, ideology-shattering, peace-disturbing decision.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a rhythmic, almost percussive quality. Brueggemann is known for this 'staccato' style. The use of repetition ('haunting voice,' 'nonconforming neighbors') acts as a refrain that anchors the listener. There is a sophisticated variation in sentence length: short, punchy declarations followed by longer, more complex explanatory clauses. The cadence builds toward the end, mimicking the 'adventure' it describes. It is clearly written for the ear, with a natural flow that suggests a spoken performance rather than a dry essay.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jerusalem is a venue for contestation.",
        "No more putting the wagons in a circle!",
        "That combination, haunting voice and nonconforming neighbors, provided 'no small dissension and debate'."

      "strengths": [
        "Excellent use of repetition to build rhetorical momentum.",
        "Effective variation between short, declarative sentences and longer rhythmic phrases.",
        "The text has a palpable 'pulse' that mirrors the 'trembling' of the city."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition to the 'five-year plan' breaks the poetic rhythm slightly with more bureaucratic phrasing.",

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Distinctly oral language; the rhythm and structure are designed for the pulpit."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is rhetorically potent and sensory. It avoids the 'sober-Reformed' dryness by embracing a more 'Poetic-Prophetic' style. The imagery of the walled city and the kitchen pots provides a concrete floor for the high-altitude theological concepts. While it occasionally flirts with sociological lists, the stewardship of language is high, with every verb chosen to maximize the 'disruptive' intent of the text. It is a text that breathes and moves, clearly intended to be heard as an 'event' rather than read as a document."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' via Peter’s vision. It introduces a conflict between the 'walled city' of Jerusalem and the 'nonconforming neighbors.' The turning point is the realization that the apostles must 'shred' tradition to follow the Spirit. The movement from the static past (wagons in a circle) to the open future (adventure) is well-executed. However, the 'five-year plan' section feels like a slightly abrupt shift from the cosmic/biblical drama to congregational pragmatics, which momentarily stalls the narrative energy.",
      "quotes": [
        "The early church must have been haunted...",
        "The conference scheduled there... is about to disrupt all of that.",
        "Apostles do not simply reiterate; they go into new territory."

        "Smooth the transition between the 'apostolic adventure' and the 'five-year plan'.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. It performs a classic 'reframing' (Cilliers). Psalm 122 is usually read as a song of peaceful arrival; here, it is reframed as a site of 'contestation.' The biblical struggle of Acts 15 is seamlessly integrated with modern struggles over identity and inclusion. The 'strangeness' of the biblical text (snakes, pots) is respected but made immediately relevant. It doesn't just apply the text; it lets the text 'haunt' the current context, forcing the listener to see their own 'walled cities' through the lens of the Jerusalem council.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jerusalem is a venue for contestation.",
        "It is like that when a new nonconforming member is admitted to the table, whether a woman or a Black or a gay...",
        "As a result Jerusalem will never be the same again."

      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant juxtaposition of Psalm 122 and Acts 15.",
        "The concept of 'reframing' is literally the engine of the sermon.",
        "The application feels like an organic necessity of the text, not an add-on."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The mention of 'Palestinians' in a sermon about Jerusalem is highly charged; it could be explored with more nuance to avoid being a mere 'trigger' word.",
        "Connect the 'peace of Jerusalem' more deeply to the 'shalom' mentioned earlier.",
        "Ensure the 'reframing' doesn't become a predictable 'liberal' trope."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing; the sermon fundamentally changes how the listener perceives 'Jerusalem' and 'Peace'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "As an 'Open Work of Art' (Stark), the sermon is mixed. It is polyvalent in its use of 'Jerusalem' as both a physical city and a state of mind. It invites the hearer to imagine 'unimaginable forms.' However, the list of specific groups (women, Black, gay, etc.) and the 'five-year plan' can feel somewhat prescriptive, closing down the 'mystery' of the adventure by defining its parameters too narrowly. The ending is rhetorically 'open' ('No more putting the wagons in a circle!'), but the moral imperative is quite clear and singular.",
      "quotes": [
        "...anticipates nonconformist neighbors who by their presence open up for us futures that take unimaginable form.",
        "The peace of Jerusalem... will consist in an open-ended venture.",
        "No more putting the wagons in a circle!"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The concept of 'adventure' inherently suggests openness.",
        "Acknowledges the 'fear and hostility' as valid parts of the process.",
        "Ends on a call to imagination rather than a specific set of rules."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Allow more room for the 'resistance' to be heard without immediately labeling it as 'wagons in a circle'.",
        "Leave the 'five-year plan' more as a metaphor for growth rather than a literal suggestion.",
        "Avoid 'sealing' the gospel into a specific political agenda too quickly."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly open, but with a strong moral/political 'seal' that directs the interpretation."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is effective, moving from a 'haunted' past to a 'daring' future. The integration of the Psalm and Acts is masterly, providing a structural tension that sustains interest. The sermon functions as a 'performance' of the very adventure it describes—breaking down the walls of traditional interpretation to let in new meanings. While the 'five-year plan' slightly disrupts the narrative flow, the overall arc is one of liberation and movement, successfully avoiding a static three-point structure."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully avoids religious kitsch. It does not offer 'cheap comfort' or easy 'happy endings.' Instead, it speaks of 'shredding tradition,' 'fear and hostility,' and 'contestation.' The emotions evoked are authentic (haunting, trembling) rather than sentimental. It takes the 'pain' of the tradition-shattering seriously. The only risk of kitsch is the 'five-year plan' which flirts with corporate-optimism, but the overall tone remains prophetic and gritty.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential 'happy ending' of the five-year plan making the 'impossible possible' (borderline).",
      "The list of 'others' could be seen as a modern cliché if not handled with the depth of the 'haunting' metaphor."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission that the decision 'shredded' the tradition.",
      "The description of Jerusalem as a place of 'contestation' rather than simple peace."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the 'haunting' and 'trembling' aspects to ensure the 'adventure' doesn't sound like a simple 'church growth' strategy."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by framing it as a 'haunting' and an 'adventure' that is 'unavailable' to those who keep the wagons in a circle. Cilliers' 'Space for Grace' is present in the 'between'—the space between the walled city and the new territory. However, the strong moral imperative toward inclusion (the 'must') slightly crowds the space where grace acts as a free gift. The 'mystery' of the Gentile inclusion is well-maintained, but the modern application is more 'task-oriented' than 'gift-oriented'.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between tradition and Spirit are sustained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the 'haunting voice' is respected and not fully explained away.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the biblical analysis; moralization increases in the contemporary application.",
    "recommendation": "Focus more on the 'Spirit' as the actor in the 'adventure' to keep the vertical dimension of grace prominent."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of the 'Prophetic-Imagistic' style. It excels in 'reframing' reality, taking a familiar liturgical setting (Jerusalem/Psalm 122) and disrupting it with the 'haunting' narrative of Acts. The poetics of language are robust, characterized by active verbs and spatial metaphors that make the theological shift feel like a physical journey. The sermon avoids the 'kitsch' of easy religious answers by emphasizing the 'shredding' and 'trembling' involved in the apostolic adventure. While it occasionally leans into modern sociological categories that can feel less 'poetic' than the biblical imagery, the overall effect is one of 'sober beauty' and rhetorical power. It creates a 'space for grace' by inviting the listener out of their 'walled city' and into an 'open-ended venture.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful reframing of Psalm 122 through the lens of Acts 15.",
      "Rhythmic and percussive language that creates a sense of urgency.",
      "Strong, concrete imagery (wagons, pots, snakes) that grounds the message."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Smooth the transition from prophetic imagination to pragmatic 'five-year plans'.",
      "Deepen the sensory description of the 'new territory' to balance the 'walled city' imagery.",
      "Ensure modern inclusive lists feel like 'human encounters' rather than 'sociological categories'."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Imagistic / Narrative-Dramatic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Show don't tell).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to listeners who value intellectual challenge, social justice, and poetic disruption over traditional comfort.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with even more 'open' endings that leave the 'adventure' to the hearer's imagination.",
      "Use more 'legato' passages to contrast with the 'staccato' rhythm, allowing for moments of quiet reflection.",
      "Explore the 'sensory' world of the 'other' more deeply to increase the 'show' factor."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a high-quality homiletic event. It successfully moves the hearer from a state of 'certitude' to a state of 'imagination.' Through the careful stewardship of language and a dynamic narrative arc, it demonstrates that the 'how' of the sermon (its disruptive, haunting form) is perfectly aligned with its 'what' (the disruptive, haunting gospel). It is an aesthetically coherent work that honors the Reformed tradition's focus on the Word while embracing the 'aesthetic turn' toward perception and performance."
