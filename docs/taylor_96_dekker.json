      "score_1_to_10": 1,
      "findings": "The text is entirely absent. The sermon functions as a commemorative speech or a sociopolitical lecture. It fails Dekker's first thesis completely: there is no Bible passage being recreated into a current, proclamatory word.",

      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select a specific pericope (e.g., Amos 5 or Galatians 3) and allow that text to dictate the content rather than using a historical figure as the primary 'text'."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 1,
      "findings": "There is no exegesis of Scripture. The 'exegesis' performed is historical and sociological, focusing on the American civil rights movement and the biography of Martin Luther King Jr. and Charles Albert Tindley.",
      "quotes": [
        "When we realize that in the 1930s and 1940s the United States Senate, mind you, was debating whether there should be... anti-lynching legislation"

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part of the text, though it is application of a 'dream' rather than a 'Word'. It is concrete, naming specific politicians, cultural trends (television series), and the zeitgeist of the 1980s.",

        "We have seen in recent years a joining of the political right to the Christian right, along with slick television packaging of religious pitchmen for greed"

      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "Because there is no biblical exposition, there can be no interwoveness between text and hearer. The hearer is drawn into a historical narrative, not the 'present of revelation'.",

        "What Dr. King and those who were associated with him did was to heave the nation forward"

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The category of 'misery' is strongly present as 'racism' and 'greed'. However, 'redemption' is largely viewed through social progress or the 'stamina' of a community rather than a Trinitarian act of God. It is more human-centric than human-oriented before God.",

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon addresses 'being lost in time' (social destruction), which Dekker allows. However, it lacks the ultimate seriousness of the 'narrow way' in a salvific sense. The choice is presented as a struggle for social decency.",

      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the 'Hebrew-Christian motivation' and in a closing hymn, but He is not the telos. He is an inspiration for a cause rather than the God-man who is the only goal of the sermon.",

        "Given the spiritual informing, the Hebrew-Christian motivation, which lay at the back of all that Martin King was"
      ],

      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "At over 2,000 words, the sermon has the 'breadth' Dekker requires. It allows for a complex historical and psychological analysis.",

  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "According to Dekker’s criteria, this text is not a sermon. It fails the most fundamental requirement: the exposition and application of a specific Bible passage. It functions as a sophisticated, historically-informed political speech with religious undertones. While it excels in analyzing the zeitgeist and the 'misery' of racism, it lacks the 'present of revelation' because it does not recreate the written Word of God.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete contemporary analysis of the 'zeitgeist' and cultural pathologies.",
      "Serious treatment of 'misery' (racism/greed) as a collective reality.",
      "Adherence to the required length for depth."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Total absence of a biblical pericope as the starting point.",
      "Lack of theological exegesis (Hebrew/Greek/Dogmatics).",
      "Christ is a secondary figure/motivation rather than the telos.",
      "Redemption is framed as social progress rather than divine grace."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon. It is a lecture on civil rights. To become a sermon in Dekker's sense, it must be completely restructured around a specific Bible passage that says something about this situation that cannot be found anywhere else."
