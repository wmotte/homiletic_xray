    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon relies heavily on the biblical imagery provided by Jeremiah rather than generating original metaphors. The preacher effectively utilizes the 'shrub in the desert' versus the 'tree by the stream' contrast, even adding a geographical nuance regarding the Judean wilderness. However, the contemporary imagery is largely drawn from pop culture and news (Botox, Tiger Woods, Halliburton), which serves as illustration but lacks the sensory depth of 'living metaphors.' The imagery is more illustrative than evocative; it explains the human condition but rarely makes the hearer 'smell the salt land' or 'feel the cool water.' According to Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell,' the sermon leans toward telling the meaning of the biblical images rather than allowing the images to perform the work themselves.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably clear and professional, avoiding dense academic jargon while maintaining theological weight. The preacher demonstrates 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre) by defining the 'operating system' of the New Testament. There is a sober precision in describing Jeremiah’s state of mind ('indignation to submission to lament'). However, the use of celebrity names (Britney Spears, Tiger Woods) dates the text significantly and risks a 'tabloid' feel that slightly undermines the 'sober-Reformed' beauty. The precision is highest when discussing the biblical text and slightly lower when generalizing about contemporary 'human folly.' The sentence structure is disciplined and hits the core of the 'human dilemma' without unnecessary decoration.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Old Testament is the operating system of the New.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a steady, didactic rhythm. It feels like a lecture-sermon, which is appropriate for a conference but lacks the poetic cadence of a liturgical event. There are moments of rhetorical power, particularly the 'And yet... and yet' transition, which creates a dramatic pause. The use of lists (the 'long saga of idolatry...') provides a staccato rhythm that emphasizes the weight of sin. However, much of the prose is 'paper language'—logical, sequential, and explanatory. It lacks the 'legato' of contemplative preaching or the rhythmic drive of a prophetic call. The musicality is functional rather than aesthetic; it serves the clarity of the argument but does not 'sing' the Gospel.",

        "And yet … and yet.",

    "average_score_language": 6.3,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by 'sober clarity.' The preacher values precision and stewardship of language, avoiding obscure jargon in favor of a direct, teaching-oriented style. While the imagery is largely borrowed from the biblical text, it is applied with geographical and contextual accuracy. The musicality is functional, serving the logical progression of the 'human dilemma' to the 'divine solution.' The primary aesthetic weakness lies in the 'telling' nature of the prose and the dated pop-culture references, which lack the timeless poetic power found in the works of preachers like Grözinger."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Lowry-esque' plot: it begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' by introducing the 'desperately corrupt' heart. The tension is sustained through a series of contemporary examples that prove the 'human dilemma.' The preacher intentionally creates a 'stone wall'—a point of despair—before leaping to Jeremiah 31. This 'turning point' is theologically and structurally sound. The movement from the 'shrub in the desert' to the 'New Covenant' provides a satisfying resolution. However, the 'leap' over 13 chapters is a bit abrupt, and the energy slightly dips during the list of celebrity scandals, which feels like a detour rather than a progression of the arc.",

        "We are up against a stone wall here. The human heart is desperately corrupt and beyond self-help.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The integration is a 'reframing' (Cilliers) of modern celebrity culture and corporate ethics through the lens of Jeremiah’s 'corrupt heart.' The preacher successfully connects the 6th-century B.C. fall of Jerusalem to 9/11, which provides a powerful frame for the audience. However, the connection to Britney Spears and Tiger Woods feels somewhat 'stuck' in 2009 and lacks the 'surprising yet natural' synthesis of a truly aesthetic integration. It feels more like 'application' than 'reframing.' The transition from the 'then' of the Judean wilderness to the 'now' of NPR interviews is organic, but the 'strangeness' of the biblical text is occasionally smoothed over to fit the moral point about 'good people speaking up.'",
      "quotes": [
        "He lived through the Babylonian invasion... which for him would have been like our 9/11.",

      "reframing_present": "Partially. It frames modern scandals as symptoms of the 'Jeremianic' heart, but the 'New Covenant' reframing is more declarative than transformative."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward a 'closed' structure. While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' in the first half (Jeremiah’s pain), the second half resolves the tension quite neatly. The preacher uses the New Covenant as a definitive 'answer' to the 'stone wall.' There is little room for the hearer to struggle with the 'not yet' of the New Covenant; it is presented as a 'transaction' that has already 'changed everything.' Following Ciska Stark’s 'open work of art,' this sermon is more monovalent than polyvalent. It tells the hearer what to think ('we can say to ourselves...') rather than inviting them into the mystery of the law written on the heart.",
      "quotes": [
        "Everything is changed for us. There is a new promise written in the blood of Christ.",
        "I am not the same person that I was.",
        "The New Testament (the New Covenant) simply does not work without the Old Testament."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The sermon takes the 'trouble' of the human heart seriously, which provides some initial openness.",
        "The use of the 'Collect' connects the sermon to the broader liturgical life of the hearer.",

        "Leave more room for the 'already/not yet' tension—how do we live when the heart still feels 'deceitful'?",

        "Avoid prescriptive internal dialogue ('we can say to ourselves...') to allow the hearer more autonomy."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Closed. It functions as a theological demonstration with a clear, resolved conclusion."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is logically sound and follows a clear movement from 'trouble' to 'grace.' The preacher successfully creates a sense of crisis (the 'stone wall') that requires the New Covenant as a resolution. The integration of text and context is functional, using 9/11 and corporate ethics to bridge the gap. However, the structure is quite 'closed,' offering a neat theological transaction that leaves little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or the 'mystery' that Cilliers and Stark advocate for. It is a 'teaching' structure that prioritizes clarity over aesthetic openness."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids religious kitsch by refusing to offer 'cheap comfort.' The preacher spends significant time in the 'ruthless and relentless' depiction of the human condition, which prevents the 'happy ending' from feeling unearned. By acknowledging that Jeremiah’s life was 'largely a misery,' the preacher avoids the 'kitsch of the successful life.' However, the transition to the New Covenant risks a slight 'theological kitsch'—the idea that 'everything is changed' can feel like a pre-chewed solution if not balanced with the reality that we still live in a 'world that groans.' The celebrity examples (Britney, Tiger) border on 'sensationalist kitsch,' but they are used to illustrate a bleak truth rather than to evoke cheap sentiment.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The somewhat 'neat' resolution that 'Everything is changed for us' without acknowledging the ongoing struggle of the 'deceitful heart'.",
      "The use of celebrity 'downfalls' as a quick way to evoke a sense of 'madness' in the heart."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The honest admission: 'Do you — do I — think we can stand up to that? I know I can’t.'",
      "The description of Jeremiah’s 'unceasing pain' and 'incurable wound' as a genuine human experience."

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is opened by the preacher’s vulnerability ('I know I can't') and the 'titanic' nature of the biblical word. The sermon respects the 'God-intoxicated' nature of the prophet. However, space is partially closed by the didactic 'teaching' tone and the 'operating system' metaphor, which makes grace sound like a technical requirement for a theological system. The 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) requires a sense of the 'unavailable' and the 'mysterious,' whereas this sermon seeks to explain and 'leap over' the difficulties of the text to reach a clear conclusion.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained well in the first half but resolved perhaps too quickly and cleanly in the second half.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the 'heart' is acknowledged, but the 'New Covenant' is explained as a 'transaction,' which reduces mystery.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails, but it is a 'systematic grace' rather than a 'phenomenological' encounter with the Holy.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'New Covenant' passage to breathe. Instead of explaining it as an 'operating system,' describe it as a 'new landscape' the hearer is invited to walk in."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically 'sober' and 'clear' work that excels in its theological integrity and linguistic precision. It avoids the pitfalls of superficial beautification, opting instead for a 'teaching' aesthetic that respects the 'titanic' weight of the biblical text. The preacher successfully creates a 'dramaturgy of the heart,' moving the hearer from the 'stone wall' of human corruption to the 'living water' of the New Covenant. While the imagery is largely derivative of the scripture, it is applied with a keen eye for contemporary relevance (9/11, corporate ethics). The sermon’s primary aesthetic limitation is its 'closed' and 'didactic' nature; it functions more as a theological demonstration than an 'open work of art.' The resolution of the 'human dilemma' is theologically correct but aesthetically 'neat,' potentially leaving the hearer with a 'pre-chewed' solution rather than a space to encounter the 'Holy' in their own ambivalence.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Theological precision and 'stewardship of language' that avoids jargon.",
      "Strong narrative arc that takes the 'trouble' of sin seriously before proclaiming grace.",
      "Effective 'reframing' of historical tragedy (Jerusalem) through modern tragedy (9/11)."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase 'showing' over 'telling' in the imagery, especially regarding the New Covenant.",
      "Open the structure to allow for the 'already/not yet' tension of the Christian life.",
      "Replace dated pop-culture references with more timeless human experiences."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Academic-Declarative with Narrative-Dramatic elements.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Thomas G. Long (the preacher as witness to the text's form) and Paul Scott Wilson (Four Pages structure of trouble/grace).",
    "audience_analysis": "Clergy and lay leaders who appreciate theological clarity, biblical depth, and a 'no-nonsense' approach to the human condition.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'poetic-imagistic' ending that leaves the hearer in the 'Space for Grace'.",
      "Use the 'inter-esse' (Cilliers) to explore the space between the 'deceitful heart' and the 'written law'.",
      "Incorporate more sensory details to make the 'New Covenant' a visceral reality."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a solid, aesthetically 'good' (6.2) example of Reformed-leaning homiletics. It honors the Word and the human condition with equal seriousness. While it lacks the 'polyphonic' openness of a Starkian work or the 'poetic power' of a Grözinger, it provides a clear, trustworthy, and aesthetically disciplined path from the despair of the 'inside out' to the hope of the 'New Covenant.' It is a sermon of 'sober beauty' that serves the congregation by telling the truth about both sin and grace."
