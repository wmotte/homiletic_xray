    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively utilizes the vivid imagery of Revelation, translating apocalyptic symbols into relatable concepts. Keller excels at 'painting' the city as a space of density and the bride as a figure of personal beauty. He follows Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don’t tell' by contrasting the 'stench' of reality with the 'crystal clear' river of life. However, some metaphors remain slightly intellectualized; he explains the image of the city more than he allows the hearer to inhabit its sensory atmosphere. The imagery of the 'wedding dress' covering flaws is a strong aesthetic move that bridges the gap between abstract righteousness and visual experience.",
      "quotes": [
        "I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem... prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.",
        "They stared at me like cows stare at a new gate.",
        "The moment Jesus Christ rose from the dead, he punched a hole in the concrete slab between fantasy and reality."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of the 'City' metaphor to explain human relational density.",
        "The 'concrete slab' metaphor provides a tactile sense of the barrier between worlds.",
        "Vivid contrast between 'wedding dresses' and 'bathing suits' to illustrate personal transformation."

        "Incorporate more sensory language regarding the 'river of life' (sound, temperature).",
        "Reduce the reliance on literary analogies (Tolkien, Updike) to allow the biblical images to breathe on their own.",
        "Deepen the 'Lamb' imagery beyond its historical-theological explanation into a more visual scene."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "The sermon leans toward 'telling' through intellectual explanation, but uses 'showing' effectively in its key illustrations (the death camp, the wedding dress)."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Keller demonstrates high stewardship of language, consistent with McEntyre’s principles. He avoids 'Canaanite' jargon, or where he uses it (e.g., 'Alpha and Omega', 'Lamb'), he provides precise, culturally accessible definitions. His word choice is economical and deliberate. He nuances the human experience of suffering and hope without falling into platitudes. The distinction between 'transcendent' and 'realistic' hope is handled with philosophical precision, ensuring that the language does justice to the complexity of the human condition in a modern urban environment.",
      "quotes": [
        "The debilitating dilemma of human nature is we want relationships and we’re afraid of relationships.",
        "To be known fully and loved fully, to be naked and unashamed, would be joy unlimited.",
        "Christianity is so much more pessimistic than any human pessimism and yet so much more optimistic than any human optimism."

      "strengths": [
        "High precision in defining theological terms for a secular audience.",
        "Avoidance of sentimental clichés in favor of psychological depth.",
        "Careful nuance in the 'already but not yet' tension."

        "Some sentences are slightly long for oral delivery, though clear in structure."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Religious jargon is systematically dismantled and 'reframed' into psychological or sociological categories (e.g., 'sin' as 'hiding/fig leaves')."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The rhythm is that of a teacher or a witness rather than a poet. There is a clear cadence in his 'problem-solution' sentence structures, but it lacks the lyrical quality of a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic found in more contemplative preaching. The use of hymns at the end provides a necessary musical lift, but the prose itself is more staccato and argumentative. It is highly effective for 'oral event' clarity (Immink), but less so for aesthetic 'flow' or poetic resonance. The repetition of 'What is this?' and 'Look at this' provides a rhythmic structure that keeps the listener engaged.",
      "quotes": [
        "Above me I hear them thumping. Out there I hear the sirens. I hear the buzz.",
        "Not too mundane but at the same time not too naïve. It needs to be multidimensional.",
        "Naked, come to thee for dress / Helpless, look to thee for grace."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong use of parallelism in the 'already/not yet' sections.",
        "Effective use of short, punchy sentences to create urgency.",
        "The inclusion of poetry/hymnody compensates for the prose's analytical tone."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The prose could benefit from more alliteration or assonance to increase memorability.",
        "Vary sentence structure more to avoid the 'lecture' rhythm.",
        "Allow for more 'legato' moments of reflection between the analytical points."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Primarily oral language; the sermon is clearly designed for a live audience with its direct address and conversational markers."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by high precision and intellectual clarity. Keller avoids religious kitsch by grounding his imagery in psychological reality and cultural critique. While not overtly 'poetic' in a traditional sense, the 'stewardship of language' is evident in how he translates ancient symbols into the vernacular of the modern city. The imagery is effective but serves the argument rather than existing for its own aesthetic sake. It is a 'witness' style that values clarity and honesty over baroque decoration."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by upsetting the equilibrium of the modern idea of progress, moves into the 'trouble' of suffering (the death camp, the sick couple), and builds toward the 'turning point' of the resurrection. The movement from 'The hope they needed' to 'The hope they got' creates a palpable sense of progression. However, the structure is somewhat predictable (the classic three-point move), which slightly diminishes the 'event' character of the sermon as a journey of discovery.",
      "quotes": [
        "They stared at me like cows stare at a new gate. Like, 'What?'",
        "The moment Jesus Christ rose from the dead, he punched a hole in the concrete slab...",
        "So what should we do with it? I’ll tell you two things to do."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong opening that connects the Apostles' Creed to the 'end of history'.",
        "Effective use of conflict (the young couple's health issues) to drive the need for the gospel.",
        "Clear resolution that links the future hope to present action."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'three headings' announcement at the start makes the structure a bit too 'closed'.",
        "The transition to the final 'how to' section feels slightly more like a list than a narrative climax.",
        "The tension could be sustained longer before the 'substitution' explanation."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey that occasionally reverts to a static three-point structure for clarity."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. Keller masters Cilliers' 'reframing'. He takes the 'strangeness' of Revelation (lambs, cities in dresses) and frames it within the context of New York density, modern fantasy literature (Tolkien), and secular philosophy (Sartre). He respects the 'then' of the original readers while making the 'now' of the modern hearer feel addressed. The integration is organic; the text isn't just a springboard, but the lens through which the modern world is re-evaluated.",
      "quotes": [
        "Those of you who live in New York City know what it’s like to live in a place that is incredibly people dense.",
        "Tolkien, being a Christian, said it’s because we have a memory trace deep in our souls.",
        "If you are a modern person, you probably believe in historical progress..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant use of the 'City' context to explain the theological concept of heaven.",
        "Reframing the 'Lamb' through the lens of substitutionary hope in a way that challenges modern individualism.",
        "Using secular literature (Updike, Sartre) to validate the biblical narrative."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could explore the 'sea' imagery (Rev 21:1) more deeply in relation to modern chaos.",
        "The historical context of the original readers (persecution) could be more vividly 'painted'.",
        "The application to 'social policies' could be more nuanced."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "The sermon offers a profound new frame, viewing the city not as a burden of density but as a prototype of heavenly love."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is intellectually 'open'—inviting skeptics to explore the resurrection—the theological structure is quite 'closed'. Keller provides definitive answers to the problems he raises. Following Stark’s 'open work of art', there is less room for the 'ambivalence of existence' once the 'substitution' logic is applied. However, the ending invitation to 'glory in thy name' despite the world's 'derision' leaves an open space for the hearer's personal response and struggle in the 'already/not yet'.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have no idea why you wouldn’t want it to be true.",
        "It depends on whether Jesus Christ rose from the dead.",
        "Let the world deride or pity / I will glory in thy name."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Invites the hearer into an 'exploration' of the resurrection rather than demanding blind faith.",
        "Acknowledges the 'already/not yet' tension, leaving room for ongoing suffering.",
        "The use of the hymn at the end invites a liturgical, rather than just intellectual, response."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'substitution' section feels a bit like a 'sealed shut' theological system.",
        "More room could be left for the 'mystery' of the New Jerusalem beyond the three categories.",
        "The conclusion could end with a more evocative question rather than a set of instructions."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A largely monovalent work that uses polyvalent imagery to lead to a single, clear theological conclusion."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is robust and intellectually engaging. Keller moves the hearer from the 'trouble' of secular hopelessness to the 'grace' of the New Jerusalem. The integration of text and context is masterful, providing a 'reframing' of city life that is both surprising and natural. While the structure is somewhat traditional and 'closed' in its theological conclusions, it creates a compelling space for the 'holy to happen' by making the resurrection a plausible and desirable reality for the modern mind."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "Keller is a fierce enemy of religious kitsch. He explicitly rejects 'simplistic, naïve, too unrealistic' hope. By including the story of the suffering couple and the 'bestial ferocity' mentioned by Dorothy Sayers, he refuses to offer 'immediate comfort without taking the pain of suffering seriously'. The sermon avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by emphasizing the 'already but not yet'—acknowledging that tears and death are the current reality. The emotion is authentic because it is grounded in the 'pessimistic' reality of human nature and the 'realistic' hope of the gospel.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential for the 'wife looking down from heaven' story to be kitsch is acknowledged and 'reframed' as a transcendent hope.",
      "The 'Lion King' circle of life is identified as a form of secular kitsch/sentiment that fails to address the loss of the self."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The honest admission of being 'less wise and compassionate' in his early ministry.",
      "The stark description of the 'death camp' as a place where secular hopes are destroyed."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this rigorous intellectual honesty; it is the primary defense against kitsch in an urban context."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'Language of Gift' section. Keller emphasizes that the city is for the 'thirsty', not the 'moral'. This moves away from moralism. However, the 'Space for Grace' is slightly constricted by the highly analytical 'substitution' logic, which can feel more like a legal transaction than a mysterious opening of the heavens. Nevertheless, by sustaining the tension between the 'already' and the 'not yet', Keller creates a space where grace is not a cheap solution but a sustaining power for the present.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between current suffering and future glory is well-sustained through the Dorothy Sayers quote.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'apocalyptic' nature of the text is respected, though the preacher's impulse is to explain the mystery rather than let it linger.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails over moralization, especially in the 'thirsty' vs. 'courageous' contrast.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'mystery' of the Lamb and the City to remain slightly more 'unavailable' to human logic to increase the sense of wonder."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.3,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high level of homiletic aesthetics within the 'Sober-Reformed' and 'Apologetic' traditions. Its beauty lies not in baroque language or emotional manipulation, but in the 'sober beauty' of clarity, precision, and the creative reframing of reality. Keller succeeds in making the 'Word' sensory by connecting the New Jerusalem to the lived experience of New York City. The aesthetic power is found in the synthesis of high theology and low culture, creating a 'Space for Grace' that is intellectually respectable and emotionally authentic. While the structure is somewhat traditional, the 'stewardship of language' and the 'anti-kitsch' stance provide a profound aesthetic depth that respects the hearer as a mature conversation partner.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'Reframing' of the biblical text within modern urban and literary contexts.",
      "Rigorous avoidance of religious kitsch and sentimentalism.",
      "Precise stewardship of language that bridges the gap between theology and the secular mind."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase the 'musicality' and poetic flow of the prose to balance the analytical tone.",
      "Allow for more 'openness' and mystery in the conclusion rather than a functional summary.",
      "Incorporate more direct sensory 'showing' of the biblical scenes."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Apologetic-Imagistic: A style that uses vivid imagery and cultural analysis to make the 'strange' world of the Bible plausible and beautiful to the modern mind.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Anti-kitsch) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Four Pages), with the intellectual precision of Marilyn Chandler McEntyre.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals most to urban professionals, skeptics, and 'modern' believers who value intellectual integrity and psychological depth over emotional fervor.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more narrative structure that doesn't announce the 'three points' at the start.",
      "Use more silence or 'staccato' pauses to allow the imagery of the text to settle.",
      "Focus on one primary image (e.g., the River) and explore its sensory qualities more deeply."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'Reframing'. It avoids the pitfalls of kitsch by honoring the 'trouble' of the human condition while opening a 'Space for Grace' through the lens of the resurrection. Its beauty is found in its 'sober simplicity' and the way it makes the 'End of History' not a terrifying apocalypse, but a 'Fantastic Reality' that is both transcendent and realistic."
