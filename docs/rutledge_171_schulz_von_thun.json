    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates a high level of exegetical competence, particularly in the Johannine corpus. The 'blue' side is characterized by a strong emphasis on the 'Sache'—the objective reality of the Resurrection as an act of God. The preacher avoids the trap of reducing the Resurrection to a mere 'symbol of hope' or a psychological shift in the disciples. Instead, the focus remains on the 'extra nos' of the event: the empty tomb, the grave cloths, and the physical wounds. The theological depth is found in the connection between the darkness of John's prologue and the darkness of the tomb, creating a coherent dogmatic arc. However, the complexity of the Joban theodicy is somewhat flattened to fit the Easter narrative, which may leave the 'factual ear' of a suffering listener slightly undernourished regarding the specific mechanics of the whirlwind's 'no-answer'.",

        "The symbolism of night and darkness pervades the Gospel of John.",

        "Clear literary-theological structure."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Could deepen the 'blue' side by addressing the tension between the 'God of the whirlwind' and the 'Wounded Christ' more explicitly.",
        "The transition between the Greek Styx and the Hebrew Sheol is culturally rich but could be more dogmatically precise."
      ],
      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The preacher uses sophisticated concepts but grounds them in accessible imagery (night, dust, wounds)."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a personality that is deeply empathetic yet intellectually disciplined. There is a controlled vulnerability, particularly when discussing the 'cold clasp of death' and the story of the friend's daughter. The 'green' side is not used for self-aggrandizement but as a bridge to the congregation's shared mortality. The preacher admits to their own 'struggle to believe,' which serves a diaconal purpose: it validates the listener's doubt. However, the self-revelation remains largely within the 'professional-pastoral' persona. There is little 'unintentional leak' of the preacher's own raw edges; the emotions feel curated for the pulpit, which maintains authority but slightly limits the 'fides qua' impact of a truly broken witness.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is a very comforting thing to me, in my own struggle to believe...",
        "I have a dear friend whose daughter died tragically.",
        "I remember reading about it in the New York Times..."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Depressive. The preacher seeks structural correctness and dogmatic safety (Compulsive) but uses a tone of harmony, closeness, and shared suffering (Depressive) to connect with the flock.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is highly subservient to the text. Personal anecdotes are used strictly to illustrate the human condition before the Word.",
      "strengths": [
        "Authentic empathy without sentimentality.",
        "Honesty about the difficulty of faith."

        "Could risk more 'unprotected' self-revelation to break the polished homiletical surface.",

    },
    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'solidary-teaching'. The preacher stands with the congregation ('Have you buried someone? If you haven’t, you will'), creating a 'we-definition' based on common mortality. The tone is paternal but not patronizing. There is a clear attempt to speak 'at eye level' regarding doubt and grief. However, the 'yellow' side occasionally shifts into a 'teaching from above' mode when explaining what 'the evangelist wants us to know.' This creates a slight distance, where the preacher becomes the mediator of the text rather than a fellow traveler. The relationship noise is low, but the authority of the 'pulpit voice' is clearly felt, which may make the 'relationship ear' feel more like a student than a brother/sister.",
      "quotes": [
        "Have you buried someone? If you haven’t, you will.",
        "Thomas stands for all of us here.",
        "We have a real choice."

        "Could use more 'we' language in the exegetical sections to reduce the teacher-student gap.",
        "The direct questions ('Do you believe this?') are powerful but could be more integrated into the relational flow."

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the strongest side of the sermon. The preacher masterfully navigates the Barthian/Lutheran distinction between Law and Gospel. The 'appeal' is not a moralistic demand for better behavior, but a 'call to faith'—which in this context is a gift (Zuspruch). The preacher explicitly rejects 'man-made gods' and 'domesticated pets,' calling the listener to a faith that rests in the 'Who' rather than the 'Why.' The appeal is to 'receive the gift' and 'be quiet, comforted that I am dust.' This is a theological appeal of the highest order: it demands a surrender of the ego to the sovereign act of God. The risk of moralism is virtually zero, as the preacher emphasizes that faith is created by the Holy Spirit through the Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let our answer be hers: 'Yes, Lord; I believe...'",
        "Do not be faithless, but believing.",
        "I will be quiet, comforted that I am dust."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Excellent. The 'Anspruch' (call to believe) is entirely grounded in the 'Zuspruch' (the reality of the Risen Christ).",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Very low. The sermon is profoundly anti-moralistic, focusing on the ontological change wrought by God.",
      "strengths": [
        "Clear distinction between human effort and divine gift.",
        "The appeal is existential, not behavioral."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition to the 'choice' ('We have a real choice') could be interpreted as a slight slip into decisionism, which slightly jars with the earlier emphasis on the Spirit creating faith."

    "congruence_judgment": "High. The preacher's serious, measured tone perfectly matches the 'blue' content of the Resurrection and the 'green' revelation of shared mortality.",
    "dominant_side": "Blue (Factual Content/Theological Sache)",
    "disruptions": "A minor disruption occurs between the 'depressive' warmth of the personal stories and the 'compulsive' rigidity of the dogmatic conclusions. The 'yellow' side occasionally feels a bit too formal for the 'green' side's vulnerability.",
    "healing_disruption": "Yes. The 'healing disruption' occurs when the preacher refuses to give a 'why' for suffering, forcing the listener's 'appeal ear' to stop seeking solutions and start seeking the Person of Christ."

  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a robust, theologically disciplined sermon cycle that exemplifies the virtues of the Hamburg school and Barthian homiletics. The preacher successfully avoids the 'American superlative' and the 'therapeutic trap,' maintaining a sharp focus on the 'Sache' of the Gospel. The interaction between the psychological reality of grief (the 'night') and the theological reality of the Resurrection is handled with precision. The sermon's greatest strength lies in its 'red' side: it calls for faith not as a work, but as a resting in the 'Who' of God. While the 'green' side is somewhat guarded by a professional-pastoral persona, the overall congruence is strong. The preacher does not 'pin down' revelation on human experience but allows the Word to remain the acting subject. The use of Job as a parallel to Thomas is a brilliant homiletical move that deepens the 'blue' content while providing a 'healing disruption' to the modern listener's demand for explanations.",
    "barthian_warning": "Low risk. The preacher explicitly warns against 'man-made gods' and 'projections of ourselves,' keeping God as the Sovereign Subject.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological integrity and Christocentric focus.",
      "Masterful balance of Law (the reality of the dust) and Gospel (the gift of life).",
      "Sober, non-manipulative emotional resonance."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce the 'teacher' distance in the relational aspect.",
      "Allow for more raw, uncurated self-revelation.",
      "Bridge the 'God of the Whirlwind' and the 'Wounded Jesus' with even more dogmatic precision."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, ample satisfactory to good performance. The sermon achieves communicative integrity by making the psychological needs of the congregation subservient to the theological truth of the text."
