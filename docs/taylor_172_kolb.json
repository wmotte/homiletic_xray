    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is highly effective in grounding abstract theological concepts in concrete, recognizable human experiences. The preacher uses the 'fruitcake' narrative and the 'Pops Swinton' character to create immediate emotional resonance. These are not merely illustrations but 'slices of life' that allow the hearer to feel the weight of the topic. The identification with the child under the bed or the student facing finals bridges the gap between the eschatological 'Great White Throne' and the hearer's daily reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "I don't suppose there has ever been a boy, and perhaps never a girl, who has not known the meaning of judgment. One knows that whenever mother with that particular look in her eye...",
        "He crawled under to get his ball and saw that rich, brown, luscious fruitcake, dotted with nuts and fruit.",

        "The transition from the 'fruitcake' story to the 'Great White Throne' is abrupt; a more nuanced bridge could deepen the emotional gravity.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Reflection is present primarily through the exploration of the 'problem' of spiritual hardening. The preacher pauses to ask 'why' one thief was saved and the other was not, and 'why' a man like Pops Swinton could not seem to cross the threshold of faith. However, the analysis remains largely anecdotal rather than analytical. It identifies the human condition of 'drifting' but provides less space for the hearer to reflect on their own specific cultural or social context beyond the immediate moral warning.",
      "quotes": [
        "What was the difference between the saved thief who died on one side of our Lord's cross and the other thief?",
        "How else are you to explain that? That one in the same plight, under the same sentence, was saved and the other....",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Theological depth is somewhat sacrificed for narrative momentum. While the sermon quotes Revelation, Matthew, and Luke, it avoids a rigorous exegetical breakdown of the 'books' or the 'throne'. The 'big idea'—the finality of judgment and the danger of a hardened heart—is clear, but the logical connections are more emotive than systematic. The preacher briefly touches on 'vague universalism' and 'second probation' but dismisses them quickly rather than engaging in theological argumentation.",
      "quotes": [
        "And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.",
        "I know that Psalm 103 particularly states that the Lord's mercy is from everlasting to everlasting. But you must be careful and read the rest of that.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon concludes with a strong, urgent call to action. The 'Active Experimentation' is framed as an immediate spiritual response: 'Today is the day of salvation.' While it lacks a 'to-do list' of social actions, it provides a clear ethical and spiritual imperative. The hearer is challenged to 'answer him when he calls' and to avoid the 'habit' that shuts out God's face. The application is specific to the internal will and the urgency of the present moment.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of narrative-driven preaching that effectively utilizes Kolb's 'Concrete Experience' to make a daunting theological topic (Judgment) accessible. It falls short in 'Abstract Conceptualization', as it avoids a deep exegetical or systematic treatment of the Revelation text in favor of emotional and anecdotal evidence. The preacher excels at creating 'homely' metaphors that facilitate 'Reflective Observation' on the human condition. The movement toward 'Active Experimentation' is powerful and urgent, though it remains focused on internal spiritual volition rather than external ethical action. The sermon is beautifully balanced for an 'Accommodating' learning style but may leave the 'Assimilating' learner with unanswered theological questions.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a highly effective pastoral exhortation that succeeds in making the 'stark' reality of judgment feel personal and urgent. From a Kolb perspective, it is a masterclass in Phase 1 (Concrete Experience), using storytelling to bypass intellectual defenses. However, its diagnostic profile shows a significant lean toward the emotional and intuitive, with a corresponding 'thinness' in theological abstraction. While it effectively moves the 'Heart' and the 'Will', it provides less 'Food for Thought' for the analytical mind. The priority for improvement is to ground the powerful narratives in a more robust exegetical framework to ensure the 'Head' is as engaged as the 'Heart'."
