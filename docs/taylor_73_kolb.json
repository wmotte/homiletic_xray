    "sermon_start_end": "I'm talking this morning about having no God, having a counterfeit god, having half gods, and having enough God. One of the occupational hazards of the work I do, as I have said to you many times in many ways, is nervousness before the time of speaking or preaching. [...] Well, you know, I've reached a place now where I can hear the echo of Jordan in my ear. But I believe that when I come down to the river, he'll say to it, 'Peace, let the purchase of my blood pass through.'",
    "notes": "The sermon exhibits a classic African-American homiletical flow, moving from existential anxiety to rhythmic, evocative imagery."

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is grounded in sensory and emotional experience. The preacher begins with personal vulnerability (nervousness at Harvard) and moves into visceral descriptions of the storm. The identification with the 'weariness' of Jesus is a strong bridge between the divine and the human experience. The imagery of the car-dusting man provides a recognizable, almost tactile slice of life.",
      "quotes": [
        "One of the most anxious of my times occurred before my first lecture at Harvard University.",
        "He would dust it every morning; this is the truth. And he would not only dust it, but he would change clothes to dust his car.",
        "I'm glad that Jesus was wearied, for it means that he has some identification with my condition when I am weary and exhausted."

        "The Harvard illustration, while concrete, may feel distant to a working-class congregation; more localized 'slices of life' could enhance identification.",

      "homiletical_manifestations": "Hook in the introduction, use of personal anecdote, and empathetic identification with the humanity of Jesus."
    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher pauses significantly to explore the 'why' of the human condition. He analyzes the phenomenon of 'counterfeit gods' and 'half gods,' connecting them to modern technology and political corruption (Iran-Contra). He explores the psychology of restlessness and the conscience, asking why people cannot sleep.",
      "quotes": [
        "What a dreadful thought it must be to hold on to some object of worship... and in that moment to discover what we thought would hold us gives way.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Theological concepts are present but are often subordinate to the narrative flow. The 'Big Idea'—the definition of 'Enough God'—is clearly formulated as a God who possesses both 'power and tenderness.' However, the exegesis of Mark 4 is more descriptive than analytical. The dogmatic deepening regarding the dual nature of Christ (Mary's child vs. Son of God) is effective but brief.",
      "quotes": [
        "Enough God is a god who can get low enough to reach you and me and to understand who we are... and a God almighty.",

      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the preacher offers a 'prescription for sleeping well,' it leans toward moralism ('treat people right'). The call to action is largely internal (having confidence, trusting in the 'peace'). There are few concrete, external action steps for the congregation to implement in their daily social or ethical lives.",

    "overall_kolb_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of narrative-visionary preaching that prioritizes emotional resonance and existential reflection over pragmatic application. It begins with a vulnerable personal anecdote that establishes a Concrete Experience, followed by a sharp Reflective Observation on the 'half-gods' of modern culture. The theological core (Abstract Conceptualization) is clear but brief, defining God through the dialectic of power and tenderness. The sermon's greatest strength lies in its Narrative retelling of the Markan text, which facilitates a second, deeper Concrete Experience. However, the sermon falls short in the Pragmatic quadrant; the 'Active Experimentation' offered is somewhat moralistic and lacks the specificity found in the earlier cultural critique. The cycle is completed, but the 'hands' are less engaged than the 'heart' and 'eyes.'",

      "Increase the 'Assimilating' depth by exploring the doctrine of the Incarnation more formally.",
      "Use a more contemporary 'slice of life' for the initial Concrete Experience."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a highly effective piece of rhetorical art that succeeds in making the biblical text 'felt' by the congregation. From a Kolb perspective, it is a masterclass in the Diverging style, excelling at bringing hearers into a state of reflective awe. Its diagnosis of the human condition is sharp, and its Christological focus is comforting. However, to reach holistic excellence, it requires a more robust commitment to the Pragmatic task. The preacher successfully 'acquaints the hearer with deity,' but provides fewer tools for the hearer to 'walk with deity' in the specific complexities of modern ethical life. It is a '7'—well-developed and evocative, but with a clear path for growth in practical application."
