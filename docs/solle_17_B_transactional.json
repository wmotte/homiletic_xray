    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It operates primarily from an Adult-Adult position, utilizing the Nurturing Parent to provide a 'safe base' for the listener's Child. It avoids the common homiletic trap of the Critical Parent (shaming) and instead offers a psychological framework for understanding human experience. By de-mythologizing the 'strong Jesus,' it allows the listener's Adapted Child to relax and move toward Free Child authenticity.",

      "High level of Adult ego engagement.",
      "Validation of vulnerability (breaking the 'strong man' mask).",
      "Promotion of autonomy through group work."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The social critique of 'the rich' could lean into a Persecutor role if not balanced with the 'We' perspective.",
      "The transition to 'political radicalism' at the end is a sudden shift in ego-state intensity."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'We' to maintain the Adult-Adult level. Ensure that the political 'call to action' remains an invitation from the Adult rather than a demand from the Critical Parent."
