    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a model of psychologically healthy homiletics. It avoids the 'Parental' trap of shaming the listener for their emotional state. By integrating medical, psychological, and theological insights, the preacher addresses the listener as a whole person. The move from 'listening to yourself' (Child) to 'talking to yourself' (Adult) is a classic TA move toward self-actualization and autonomy.",

      "The 'three cures' could be perceived as a 'Con' if not caveated as lifelong processes.",
      "Slightly repetitive in the 'Condition' section which may trigger a 'Victim' loop in the listener."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize the 'Adult' agency of the listener. Ensure that the 'unconditional love' of God is presented as a reality to be processed by the Adult, rather than a 'smothering' comfort for the Child."
