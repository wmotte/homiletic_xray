    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is intellectually stimulating and avoids the 'smothering' dependency of many religious texts. However, it leans heavily on a Critical Parent ego state to enforce social change. While the 'Adult' analysis of systemic issues is strong, the psychological weight of the 'Moses' section risks triggering a 'Rebellious Child' or 'Guilty Child' response in the listener rather than a sustained Adult commitment to change. The use of 'ruin' as a motivator is a classic Parent-Child transaction.",

      "Strong Adult engagement with socio-economic reality.",
      "Refusal to provide 'cheap grace' that creates dependency.",
      "Empowers the 'nameless' by validating their identity (Lazarus)."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "High reliance on 'sanctions' and 'torment' to motivate behavior.",
      "The 'Bait and Switch' between Abrahamic grace and Mosaic law can feel like a psychological trap."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward a 10/10 health score, the preacher could speak more from the 'Free Child' to share a vision of the 'common good' that is attractive and joyful, rather than just a 'Critical Parent' vision of avoiding ruin. This would invite the listener's Adult to choose the good, rather than the Adapted Child to fear the bad."
