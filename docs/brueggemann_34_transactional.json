  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 7,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically robust because it avoids the typical 'Nurturing Parent' smothering of many sermons. It treats the audience as Adults capable of handling a difficult, non-linear interpretation of scripture. However, it leans heavily on a 'Critical Parent' deconstruction of Joseph, which can leave the listener feeling judged by association without a clear path to grace, other than 'don't be like him.'",

      "The 'Payoff' of the sermon is a bit heavy on guilt/judgment.",
      "Lack of Nurturing Parent makes the 'vision' feel like another demand rather than a gift."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To remain game-free, the preacher could acknowledge his own struggle with 'imperial nightmares' (Adult-Adult vulnerability) rather than speaking from a height of Critical Parent judgment."
