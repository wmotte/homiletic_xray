    "estimated_word_length": 2400,

    "sermon_start_end": "During the reading, we just heard the Apostle enumerate and denounce the passions of man. “Do you not realize,” he asked, “that your bodies are the very members of Christ? [...] May the example they set motivate husbands and wives to avoid adultery at least. If virgins do more than is required, let the rest do at least what is commanded."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon centers on 1 Corinthians 6, specifically the theology of the body as members of Christ. It stays close to the text's logic, though it occasionally drifts into general moral exhortation regarding virginity and marriage at the end.",
      "quotes": [
        "Paul says our bodies are the members of Christ because, when becoming man for us, Christ became our Head"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more sharply on the unique claim of 1 Cor 6:15—that physical immorality is a 'theft' of Christ's members—rather than general warnings about hell."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The exegesis is more dogmatic than historical. It uses the text to build a systematic theology of the soul and body (Spirit/Soul/Body hierarchy) rather than exploring the specific Corinthian context of temple prostitution or Greek dualism.",
      "quotes": [
        "The soul is the life of the body, and God is the life of the soul."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the specific historical-religious context of Corinth to ground the 'whore' imagery in its original setting."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is psychologically vivid but lacks modern 'zeitgeist' relevance. It uses archetypal imagery (the bedroom, the dark corner, the prison) which is effective but remains within a timeless moral framework rather than addressing contemporary cultural philosophy.",
      "quotes": [
        "You don’t let a wanton into the room where you sleep with your wife, and yet—though you’re a temple of God—you go out looking for a sex partner."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Translate the 'sins of the flesh' into contemporary manifestations of bodily commodification or digital-age intimacy issues."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon excels here. It does not separate 'theory' from 'practice' but constantly moves between the biblical metaphor and the hearer's conscience. The hearer is 'expounded' alongside the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wait a minute. Isn’t your body a member of Christ? What are you about to do? Come back here."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this movement but ensure the 'application' side doesn't become repetitive in its focus on fear."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The three parts are clearly present. Misery is the slavery to passion and fear of death; redemption is Christ as the Head and the ransom paid; gratitude is the 'chaste fear' or love that seeks to please the Father.",
      "quotes": [
        "disregarding both your Lord and the ransom he paid to redeem you.",
        "What they fear is, not condemnation or punishment, but wounding their Father’s heart"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'redemption' part is more explicitly linked to the Spirit's work in the present moment, not just a past ransom."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "This is a strong point. The sermon explicitly addresses the 'two dwelling places' and the reality of being lost, both temporally (losing God as the life of the soul) and eternally (Gehenna).",
      "quotes": [
        "You see, there are two dwelling places: one amid eternal flames, and the other in the eternal kingdom."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The distinction between 'lost in time' and 'lost in eternity' could be more clearly balanced; it leans heavily on the latter."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos as the 'Head' and 'Life,' but the sermon risks becoming a sermon on 'Love/Fear' as abstract principles. The doctrine of the two natures is implicit in the discussion of Christ taking a body.",
      "quotes": [
        "since he also united himself to a body... it necessarily follows that even our bodies are also his members."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make Christ as the specific source of grace more prominent in the transition from 'servile fear' to 'chaste love'."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "With an estimated 2400 words, the sermon provides the 'breadth' Miskotte demands. It allows for psychological depth and multiple rhetorical movements.",
      "improvement_point": "None; the length is adequate for the complexity of the subject."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a robust example of proclamatory preaching that takes the biblical text and the human condition seriously. It falls short in modern cultural analysis (Thesis 3) and historical-critical exegesis (Thesis 2), favoring a more timeless dogmatic-psychological approach. However, it strongly aligns with Dekker’s requirements for the 'two ways' and the 'interwovenness' of text and life.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong rhetorical engagement that 'actualizes' the Word for the hearer.",
      "Unflinching address of the 'two ways' and the possibility of being lost.",
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' (misery, redemption, gratitude) as a background structure."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks specific contemporary cultural/sociological context.",
      "Exegesis is subordinated to dogmatic categories of soul and body.",
      "The ending drifts into a hierarchy of 'virginity' that feels less grounded in the primary text's immediate urgency."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a sermon in the true sense of the definition. It avoids 'general truths' by forcing the hearer to confront their own body as Christ's member. While it lacks modern humanities-based application, its theological depth and seriousness regarding the 'two ways' make it a valid form of the Word of God."
