    "summary": "This sermon is a psychologically healthy example of 'Adult-Adult' communication. It identifies and names the 'Parental' scripts of religious tradition that keep individuals (specifically women) in an 'Adapted Child' state. By validating curiosity and the 'Coming Out' process, the preacher promotes autonomy and reality-testing. The use of personal vulnerability prevents the preacher from occupying a 'Rescuer' or 'Superior Parent' position.",

      "The transition to the 'patriarchal God' having 'fear' could be misinterpreted as a 'Victim' projection.",
      "Ensure the 'Coming Out' call doesn't become a new 'Critical Parent' demand for those not ready."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' to process the 'Parental' traditions. Maintain the balance of acknowledging the 'coldness' of reality (Adult) with the warmth of solidarity (NP)."
