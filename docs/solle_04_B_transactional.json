    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a psychologically healthy example of 'Adult-Adult' communication. It identifies the 'Critical Parent' structures of traditional theology and offers the 'Free Child's' curiosity as a path to autonomy. By using the 'Coming Out' metaphor, it encourages the listener to take responsibility for their own identity and growth. The preacher’s use of personal vulnerability prevents a hierarchical 'Parent-Child' dynamic.",
    "strengths": [
      "High degree of Adult-Adult transparency.",
      "Empowerment of the Free Child (curiosity, aesthetics).",
      "Deconstruction of coercive religious structures (Critical Parent)."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The description of the 'patriarchal God' could be misinterpreted as a new 'Persecutor' role in the Drama Triangle if not balanced with the 'God who clothes' image.",
      "Ensure the 'Coming Out' pressure doesn't become a new 'Adapted Child' requirement for the listeners."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I-messages' and personal reflections as you did with the friend's letter; this anchors the sermon in the 'Here-and-Now' Adult position."
