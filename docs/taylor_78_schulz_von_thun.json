    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The 'Sache' (factual content) is centered on the necessity of prayer as an antidote to spiritual exhaustion. The preacher utilizes a historical-biographical framework, citing the heritage of Black Baptist preaching and the specific tomb of a founder in Savannah. Theologically, the sermon moves from the human condition of 'fainting' to the Christological foundation of the 'Great High Priest' in Hebrews. While the exegetical depth of Luke 18:1 itself is limited—the parable of the persistent widow is bypassed in favor of a thematic exploration of Jesus' own prayer life—the dogmatic move toward Christ's intercession is clear. The 'blue' side serves as a vehicle for the 'living Christ' (Barth), though it leans more on historical narrative than rigorous textual exegesis.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a deep, personal rootedness in the Black homiletical tradition. There is a conscious 'Selbstdarstellung' of a guardian of a 'grand' and 'lofty' language. However, involuntary 'Selbstenthüllung' occurs when he speaks of his mother's prayers and his own aging ('I think about that now more and more'). This vulnerability is 'diaconal'—it serves to validate the struggle of the listener. The preacher does not present himself as a prayer-warrior hero, but as one who, like the congregation, faces the 'awful odds of this society' and the 'spray misting' of the Jordan. The 'I' is present but never eclipses the 'He' of the Gospel.",
      "quotes": [

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive/Harmonious with a touch of Compulsive structure. The preacher seeks closeness ('my brother and my sister') and avoids 'schizoid' distance. The structure is orderly and rhythmic, showing a 'compulsive' care for the 'grandeur' of the language.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The relationship is one of 'Solidary Authority'. The preacher speaks from within the community ('our black religious enterprise'), establishing a 'We-definition' that is inclusive and protective. He addresses the congregation as 'gentlefolks' and 'my brother and my sister,' creating an atmosphere of mutual struggle. There is a paternalistic but warm 'teaching' tone. The 'yellow' signals are designed to build trust before the 'red' appeal of 'Pray on' is issued. He acknowledges the specific social pressures on 'our menfolk,' showing a relational awareness of the congregation's socio-political reality.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in the balance of 'Zuspruch' (Promise) and 'Anspruch' (Demand). The 'red' side is the command: 'Pray on.' However, this is not a moralistic demand based on human willpower. The preacher explicitly states that prayer is 'impossible for us to pray unaided.' The appeal is grounded in the theological promise of Christ’s intercession. The 'demand' to pray is actually an invitation to lean on the 'Gift' of Christ's ongoing prayer. This avoids the 'ready-to-jump' servility by shifting the burden from the listener's performance to Christ's vocation at the 'right hand of Majesty.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Men ought always to pray, and not to faint.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a strong, classically constructed sermon that masterfully integrates psychological empathy with Barthian Christocentrism. The preacher begins with a sociological and historical defense of his tradition, which serves to establish relational 'Yellow' credit with the congregation. He then moves into a 'Green' revelation of the universal human tendency to 'faint' under the weight of life's 'uneven journey.' The psychological acuity here is high; he identifies 'guilt' and 'social odds' as energy-drainers. Theologically, the sermon avoids the pitfall of 'psychologization' by shifting the focus from the human act of praying to the divine act of Christ's intercession (Immink's 'Acting Subject'). The 'Red' appeal to 'Pray on' is thus not a legalistic burden but a 'diaconal' encouragement. The congruence is high, as the preacher's own 'body bowed' vulnerability matches the 'knee bent' theology he espouses. While the opening is slightly disjointed, the homiletical arc toward the 'Jordan' provides a powerful, 'healing disruption' that forces the listener to look beyond their own strength.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon flirts with 'Erlebnis' (experience) in the first half but successfully pivots to the 'Extra Nos' of Christ's intercession in the second half.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Masterful use of rhythmic language to reinforce the 'Appeal'.",
      "Strong Christological grounding of a practical discipline (prayer).",
      "Authentic, non-egoistic self-revelation."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Tighten the connection between the Memorial Day introduction and the main theme.",
      "Incorporate more direct exegesis of the Lucan text (the Widow and the Judge).",
      "Clarify the 'Canticles' reference to avoid factual confusion for the 'Factual Ear'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively integral sermon that uses the preacher's personality and cultural heritage to serve the theological promise of Christ's advocacy."
