    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically complex. It avoids the 'Nanny' Nurturing Parent and the 'Fire and Brimstone' Critical Parent, instead opting for an 'Existentialist Parent' who demands the congregation face the 'Darkness.' While it risks the game of 'Ain't It Awful' by wallowing in tragedy (starvation, plane crashes) to prove a point, its Adult-to-Adult honesty about the silence of God is refreshing and autonomy-promoting. It validates the listener's real-world fears rather than suppressing them.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Watch the 'Ain't It Awful' dynamic; ensure that the 'Darkness' is a shared human reality rather than a required liturgical performance. Reduce the 'We do it better than other denominations' CP-talk to keep the transaction purely Adult-Adult."
