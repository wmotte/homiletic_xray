In the Book of Acts, the early Christians are big public players [...] We join in the walking, the leaping, the praise of God. We are a part of the watching crowd . . . filled with wonder and amazement . . . and gratitude at what has happened (3:10).",

      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a historical-narrative experience rather than a contemporary one. While the preacher describes the 'impressive courtroom scene' and the 'disabled man,' the initial engagement is intellectual-narrative rather than immediate sensory experience for the hearer. The connection to the hearer's world is delayed until the middle of the sermon. The 'feeling' level is primarily accessed through the biblical characters' tension with authorities rather than a modern 'slice of life.'",

    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of a theological-reflective discourse that successfully reclaims a biblical concept (resurrection) for a specific social context (healthcare). It falls short in providing concrete, contemporary 'Active Experimentation' and relies heavily on the biblical narrative to provide the 'Concrete Experience' rather than engaging the hearer's immediate life-world. The sermon is intellectually stimulating and visionary, but leans toward the 'Assimilating' learning style. It functions well as a 'Declarative' and 'Visionary' piece, providing a robust 'regime change' framework that challenges the status quo. However, the transition from the 'alternative medicine' of the first century to the specific 'alternative medicine' of the 21st-century hearer remains somewhat abstract, ending in 'resolve' rather than a clear 'experiment.'",

      "Theological redefinition of resurrection as a public, healing power.",

      "Use more 'priestly listening' to describe the specific pains of the local community."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a well-crafted, intellectually rigorous piece of homiletics that excels in the 'Abstract Conceptualization' and 'Reflective Observation' phases of Kolb's cycle. It provides a clear, prophetic 'Normative' task (Osmer) and a compelling 'Visionary' structure (Anderson). Its primary diagnostic weakness is the lack of specific 'Active Experimentation' and a reliance on biblical narrative for 'Concrete Experience.' For a celebratory occasion, it succeeds in providing a 'Big Idea,' but as a tool for adult learning and transformation, it would benefit from more 'hands-on' application and contemporary grounding. It is a strong '7'—a well-developed sermon that serves its purpose but has clear paths for pedagogical improvement."
