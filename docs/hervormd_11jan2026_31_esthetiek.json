      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating a 'cinematic' experience, largely by following Paul Scott Wilson's 'show, don't tell' principle. The preacher uses the biblical narrative to paint vivid scenes—the 'stench' of the carcass is implied by the 'dried out' description, and the sensory contrast between the 'grimmige kaken' (grim jaws) of the lion and the 'zoetheid' (sweetness) of the honey is palpable. The use of Rembrandt’s painting as a visual anchor further strengthens the imagery. However, some metaphors remain somewhat traditional ('the lion of Judah'), which prevents a higher score. The imagery effectively serves the 'reframing' of the text, turning a bizarre ancient story into a visible drama for the congregation.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strongly tilted towards 'showing'. The preacher describes the scene (the dripping honey, the angry men) rather than just stating the theological meaning."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The language is highly accessible but lacks the 'stewardship of language' advocated by McEntyre. The tone is very informal, bordering on 'Canaanite' jargon in its application ('vleeselijk kind van God', 'bevindelijke Pinkster voorganger'). While this aids clarity for a specific subculture, it lacks linguistic precision. There is a frequent use of 'filler' words and colloquialisms ('Tjonge jonge', 'Hoppa, dumpen', 'jankt') which, while engaging, reduces the aesthetic 'sober beauty' of the Reformed tradition. The precision is sacrificed for the sake of rapport with the audience.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a distinct oral rhythm, characterized by short, staccato sentences typical of a 'happening' or 'event' (Immink). There is a natural cadence in the repetitive structures ('Toen... toen... toen...'), which functions well for an oral delivery. However, the rhythm is often interrupted by conversational asides ('Ik ga eindigen hoor', 'Even een fotootje maken'), which breaks the poetic flow. It is definitely 'oral language' rather than 'paper language', but it lacks the lyrical quality that would elevate it to a higher aesthetic level.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 6,
    "summary_language": "The language is vibrant, cinematic, and unpretentious. It prioritizes immediate impact and 'showing' the biblical narrative over linguistic elegance or precision. While it successfully avoids 'dry' academic prose, it occasionally slips into overly colloquial or clichéd religious speech. The musicality is functional for a live event but lacks poetic depth. It is a 'sober-expressive' style that values the 'event' of the sermon over the 'document' of the text."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with the 'upsetting of equilibrium' (the bizarre story of Samson) and moves through the 'riddle' as a central conflict. The preacher maintains tension by constantly asking 'How can this be?' and 'What is the secret?'. The movement from the 'honey' (victory) to the 'bitter' (betrayal) creates a compelling arc. The conclusion, however, feels slightly fragmented as it jumps between the parents' joy, the friend's marriage, and the heavenly wedding, losing some of the focused energy of the narrative arc.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Cilliers' 'reframing' is present here: the preacher looks at modern 'burn-out' and youth 'dropping out' through the lens of Samson’s struggle. The integration is mostly successful, though sometimes the 'leaps' are a bit traditional (Samson as a type of Christ). The preacher respects the 'strangeness' of the text (calling it 'bizar') but quickly 'smooths' it over with moral applications about dating and church attendance. The 'reframing' of the riddle as the question of how a sinner stands before God is a classic but effective homiletic move.",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon struggles with the 'Opera Aperta' (Stark) concept. While it acknowledges the 'mystery' of God's ways, it tends to provide very 'closed' answers. The preacher frequently answers his own rhetorical questions ('Weet u het antwoord? Dat is de liefde'). The moralizing sections (on dating and 'manipulation') are quite prescriptive, leaving little room for the hearer's own appropriation. However, the ending quote about 'duistere wegen' (dark ways) provides a small window of aesthetic openness, admitting that we don't see the full solution yet.",
      "quotes": [
        "Dat red je niet, hoor. Dat red je niet. Dat kan ik u nu al vertellen.",

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly monovalent. The preacher acts as the 'decoder' of the riddle rather than a co-traveler in the mystery."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon has a strong, narrative-driven structure that keeps the audience engaged. It moves logically through the biblical text while weaving in contemporary applications. The 'dramaturgy' is effective in building tension around the 'riddle'. However, the structure is somewhat 'closed', with the preacher providing definitive answers to the tensions raised. The integration of text and context is functional but follows traditional paths, missing the opportunity for a more radical or surprising 'reframing'."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon avoids the worst forms of 'religious kitsch' by acknowledging the 'bizarre' and 'vleeselijk' (fleshly) nature of the story. It doesn't offer a 'happy ending' for Samson in this chapter—it ends with a 'bloedbruiloft' (blood wedding) and betrayal. However, there is a slight 'kitsch' element in the quick transition to 'sweet' theological solutions ('Jezus is de oplossing') and the use of somewhat sentimental imagery ('Zonnekind', 'roze wolk'). The preacher's personal story of burn-out provides authentic depth that counteracts the potential for kitsch.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'roze wolk' (pink cloud) cliché for marriage.",
      "The somewhat sentimental 'Joepie, joepie' reference at the end."

      "The honest admission of being 'leeg' (empty) and 'burn-out' during ministry.",
      "The refusal to make Samson a 'perfect' hero, calling him 'zwak van binnen'."

    "recommendation": "Avoid 'pre-chewed' emotional phrases like 'zoetheid van de honing' without grounding them in the 'bitterness' of the struggle more thoroughly."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened primarily through the theme that 'our mess never stops God's mission'. This is a strong aesthetic of grace (Cilliers). However, the space is partially closed by the heavy moralizing about youth behavior and dating. The sermon oscillates between 'God's unavailable work' and 'our required behavior'. The 'mystery' of the riddle is used to point to grace, which is aesthetically effective, but the 'dogmatic sealing' of the answers slightly restricts the 'space'.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained in the narrative (the parents' grief) but resolved quickly in the application.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of God's providence is respected, but the 'riddle' of salvation is explained away quite quickly.",

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of 'Narrative-Dramatic' preaching within the Reformed tradition. Its primary aesthetic strength lies in its 'cinematic' quality—the ability to make the biblical text visible and palpable to the congregation. The preacher functions as a 'witness' (Long) to the drama of Samson, effectively using imagery and a dynamic narrative arc to sustain interest. \n\nHowever, the sermon is aesthetically limited by its linguistic informality and its tendency toward a 'closed' structure. While the conversational tone makes the message accessible, it occasionally lacks the 'stewardship of language' that would give it poetic weight. The 'reframing' of the text is successful in connecting ancient violence to modern grace, but it follows very traditional typological paths. The sermon excels as an 'event' (Immink) but is less successful as an 'open work of art' (Stark), as it leaves little room for the hearer to dwell in the ambivalence of the story without being led to a pre-determined conclusion.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Vivid, sensory imagery that makes the biblical scene 'visible'.",
      "Strong narrative arc that maintains tension through the 'riddle' motif.",
      "Authentic vulnerability in the preacher’s personal application."

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Dramatic / Sober-Reformed",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Paul Scott Wilson (imagery/Four Pages) and Gerrit Immink (performance/event).",
    "audience_analysis": "Appeals most to a 'middle-of-the-road' Reformed congregation that values storytelling, direct application, and emotional honesty.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'poetic' conclusion that doesn't rely on 'I am ending now' markers.",
      "Try to 'show' the grace of God through a metaphor rather than 'telling' it through a dogmatic statement.",
      "Read the text aloud to identify and remove 'paper language' filler words."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is aesthetically 'good' (6.2) because it successfully transforms a difficult text into a living drama. It avoids the 'kitsch' of easy moralism by grounding the message in the preacher's own struggle and the 'messiness' of Samson's life. To move toward an 'excellent' score, it would need more linguistic precision and a greater willingness to let the 'openness' of the biblical work of art speak for itself without over-explanation."
