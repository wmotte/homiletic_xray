    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily as a tool for intellectual illustration rather than sensory immersion. While it references the 'marketplace' and 'altars,' these function more as conceptual metaphors than vivid scenes. The preacher avoids the 'cinematic' style of Paul Scott Wilson in favor of a 'Socratic' style. However, the use of metaphors like 'red in tooth and claw' and 'heart-shaped hope' provides some visual anchoring for abstract concepts. The imagery is effective but remains subservient to the logical argument, lacking the 'smell of the pigsty' or tactile richness that characterizes high-scoring aesthetic preaching. It appeals to the 'mind's eye' through cultural references rather than the 'senses' through poetic description.",
      "quotes": [
        "Even though nature is red in tooth and claw, even though nature believes in the strong eating the weak...",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The stewardship of language is a primary strength. The preacher exhibits high precision in defining terms, particularly the distinction between 'moral feeling' and 'moral obligation.' Religious jargon is almost entirely absent or carefully translated for a secular audience (e.g., explaining 'dialegomai'). The language is economical and hits the core of the argument without unnecessary 'Canaanite' decoration. This reflects McEntyre’s 'caring for words' by ensuring they are accessible and truthful to the context. The precision in dissecting the secular worldview demonstrates a high level of intellectual and linguistic care.",
      "quotes": [
        "Dialegomai is not preaching. He’s entering into dialogue.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is clearly written for the ear, but its rhythm is that of a lecture or a debate rather than a poem. It lacks the cadence and 'sober beauty' of traditional Reformed liturgy. The sentence structure is often staccato and functional, designed to drive a logical point home. While it has a natural 'flow' in a conversational sense, it lacks rhetorical figures like alliteration or parallelism that would give it a musical quality. It is 'oral language' but not 'poetic language.' The rhythm is dictated by the 'if/then' logic of the argument rather than the aesthetic weight of the words.",
      "quotes": [
        "You can’t prove them in a laboratory. You can’t prove them in a test tube. They’re beliefs.",
        "He didn’t detach from us. He attached to us. He didn’t run away from suffering... He ran toward it.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 6.33,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by 'sober clarity' and intellectual precision. While it lacks the sensory richness of Wilson’s imagery or the musicality of poetic homiletics, it excels in 'stewardship of language' by translating ancient truths into contemporary idioms. The language is functional, serving the 'logos' of the argument. It is an aesthetic of 'transparency'—the words are designed not to be looked at, but to be looked through, toward the logical and existential reality of the Gospel."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by upsetting the equilibrium (the decline of belief), introduces a conflict (the incoherence of secular worldviews), and moves toward a resolution in the resurrection. It is not a static three-point sermon but a 'dynamic journey' through the marketplace of ideas. The tension is maintained by the 'Socratic' approach—challenging the hearer's own premises. However, the energy occasionally dips during the lengthy philosophical explanations (Elizabeth Anscombe section), which feels more like an academic detour than a narrative progression.",
      "quotes": [
        "So what is the future of Christian belief in a world in which fewer and fewer believe?",
        "But then he’s interrupted. That’s okay for us, because we know what Paul says...",
        "My question is… Do you have God-sized beliefs big enough for your moral intuitions?"

      "strengths": [
        "Strong opening that connects the biblical text to the immediate cultural anxiety.",
        "The 'turning point' from moral obligation to the hope of the resurrection is well-timed.",
        "The conclusion effectively circles back to the 'marketplace' motif."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Tighten the middle section; the philosophical analysis of Anscombe is slightly too long for the narrative arc.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest aesthetic feature. It is a masterclass in Cilliers' 'reframing.' The preacher takes the 'strangeness' of the Athenian marketplace and maps it perfectly onto the secular New York context. The 'altar to the unknown god' is reframed as the secular person's 'moral intuition.' This synthesis is surprising yet feels natural. It honors the historical text while making it an urgent contemporary word. The preacher doesn't just 'apply' the text; he allows the text to provide a new lens through which the hearer sees their own 'secular' life as actually 'religious.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Athens was the intellectual center... sort of like Oxford, Cambridge, and all of the Ivy League schools.",
        "I believe if Paul were here he would say exactly the same thing to New Yorkers.",
        "That knowledge is an altar to the unknown God in the midst of New York City."

      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of secularism as a form of unacknowledged faith.",
        "Organic transition between the 1st-century Agora and the 21st-century NY Times.",
        "Respects the 'strangeness' of the resurrection while showing its existential necessity."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Could explore the 'Epicurean' and 'Stoic' parallels in NYC more concretely (e.g., consumerism vs. mindfulness).",
        "The connection to the Apostles' Creed mentioned at the start feels slightly tacked on.",
        "More focus on the 'Dionysius and Damaris' ending to show the human response in context."

      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing. It offers a completely new frame for understanding secular identity."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is 'open' in its invitation to dialogue but 'closed' in its logical structure. Following Stark, it functions as an 'open work' by acknowledging the hearer's skepticism and inviting them into a 'Socratic' space. However, the logical 'if/then' structure is so tight that it leaves little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or the 'mystery' of God. It seeks to 'prove' the necessity of God, which can feel coercive to some hearers. The ending is an invitation to 'go and do likewise,' which is more of a directive than an open-ended aesthetic invitation.",
      "quotes": [
        "May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?",
        "I don’t know who you are here tonight, but I do know you do believe.",
        "Go and do likewise. Let us pray."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The 'Socratic' approach treats the hearer as a mature, thinking partner.",
        "Acknowledges the difficulty of belief in a secular age.",
        "The 'heart-shaped hope' section appeals to desire rather than just duty."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Leave more room for the 'unresolved'—not every secular objection needs a perfect logical answer.",
        "The conclusion could be more of an invitation to 'wonder' than a call to 'action'.",
        "Allow for more 'polyphony'—different voices or perspectives within the sermon."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent logic, but with an 'open' conversational posture."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are defined by a sophisticated 'reframing' of the hearer's reality. The sermon moves with a clear narrative arc from the 'problem' of secularism to the 'solution' of the Gospel. It is a 'dramaturgy of the mind,' where the tension lies in the clash of worldviews. While the structure is logically 'closed,' the tone remains 'open' and dialogical, creating a space where the secular hearer feels understood before they are challenged. It is a highly effective 'performance' of intellectual hospitality."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids the 'happy ending' cliché and the 'pre-chewed emotions' of sentimental preaching. Instead of offering 'cheap comfort,' it engages with the 'pain of suffering' and the 'brutality of culture.' The preacher explicitly critiques the 'cowardly' running away from suffering. The emotions evoked (distress, longing, hope) feel authentic because they are grounded in a rigorous analysis of human experience. It does not use 'Jesus' as a magic wand to fix problems but as a 'witness' to a different way of being in the world.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The phrase 'heart-shaped hope' teeters on the edge of sentimentality, but is rescued by its connection to the 'brutal' reality of the resurrection.",
      "None significant."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The discussion of the 'terrible plagues' and Christians staying to die—this takes suffering seriously.",
      "The admission that 'we will be called intellectual lightweights'—this avoids the kitsch of the 'triumphant' Christian."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this rigor; avoid the temptation to use 'heart-shaped' metaphors too frequently as they can lose their edge."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened through the concept of 'reframing.' By showing that everyone 'lives by faith,' the preacher levels the playing field, creating a 'space' where grace becomes a possibility for the skeptic. The sermon sustains the tension between 'already' and 'not yet' by focusing on the resurrection as a 'restoration' rather than just a 'consolation.' However, the 'space' is occasionally crowded by the preacher's own logical density; the 'mystery' of God is sometimes overshadowed by the 'argument' for God.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between secularism and faith are sustained well through the Socratic method.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'unknown god' motif respects mystery, but the subsequent explanation seeks to 'identify' it perhaps too quickly.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails, particularly in the section on Jesus 'plunging' into the world for us.",
    "recommendation": "Allow for more silence or 'empty space' in the sermon where the mystery of God can breathe without being explained."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high-quality example of 'Apologetic Aesthetics.' Its beauty lies not in poetic ornamentation but in the 'sober beauty' of a well-constructed argument that does justice to the complexity of modern life. It excels in 'reframing' (Cilliers) and 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre). The sermon functions as a 'bridge' between the ancient text and the modern city, creating an aesthetic of 'intellectual hospitality.' While it could benefit from more sensory imagery and a more 'open' ending, it successfully avoids religious kitsch and creates a genuine 'space for grace' for the secular hearer. It is a 'witness' (Long) that uses reason to clear the path for an encounter with the Holy.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the secular worldview as a religious one.",
      "Exceptional precision and care in language use, avoiding all jargon.",

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Apologetic-Socratic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Witness' model of Thomas Long.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically most appealing to 'skeptical intellectuals' and 'urban professionals' who value logic, clarity, and cultural relevance.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a 'Page 2' (Wilson) that is more descriptive of the 'trouble' in the city.",
      "Use a more poetic, rhythmic passage when describing the 'new heavens and new earth'.",
      "End with a provocative question rather than a directive to 'go and do likewise'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust performance of 'faith seeking understanding.' It honors the Reformed tradition's focus on the Word while embracing the 'aesthetic turn' through its deep concern for the hearer's perception and the 'reframing' of reality. It is a 7/10—a strong, effective, and well-considered work that serves as an excellent model for urban preaching, though it stops short of the 'poetic' heights of a 9/10 model sermon."
