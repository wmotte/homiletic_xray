  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Romans 5 and 6 as a thematic springboard. However, it fails Dekker's requirement of finding what is in THIS passage that is nowhere else. Instead, it treats the text as a general proof-text for the 'Adam/Christ' dichotomy, which is a common Pauline theme. The specificity of the 'baptism' imagery in Romans 6 is mentioned but not explored in its unique depth.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are reading the Epistle to the Romans this summer... as befits its importance.",
        "Last Sunday we heard about Adam and Christ.",
        "Perhaps you will remember the verse from last week’s reading..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more sharply on the unique logic of Romans 6 (the ontological change through baptism) rather than repeating the general Adam/Christ contrast from chapter 5."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is largely absent. There is no mention of the Greek terminology, the historical context of the Roman congregation, or the specific theological problem Paul was addressing (the 'shall we sin so grace may abound' question). The preacher relies on systematic categories ('Adam' as 'sinful humanity') rather than historical-critical exposition.",
      "quotes": [
        "'Adam' is the name Paul gives to sinful humanity.",
        "Paul draws a picture of sin and its companion, death, as an enslaving power..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the original context of the Roman church. Explain why Paul uses the legal metaphor of 'acquittal' and the ritual reality of 'baptism' in this specific historical setting."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is the sermon's strongest point. The preacher connects the text to very concrete contemporary issues: the death penalty (Rizzo), the conflict in the Balkans, Tibetan exiles, and healthcare inequality (dentists). It avoids 'general truths' by naming specific news stories and social realities.",
      "quotes": [
        "The banner headline reads 'Rizzo Gets Death Penalty.'",
        "The news accounts from the Balkans this week...",
        "The article quoted a dentist who said that one patient like that would empty his waiting room."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application flows from the text's unique specificity rather than using the text to comment on current events."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon successfully mixes contemporary anecdotes with biblical citations. It does not follow a 'first half exegesis, second half application' structure. However, because the 'exposition' is thin, the 'application' often feels like it is driving the text rather than the text driving the application.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let’s go back to Tibet for a minute.",
        "Now I am going to say something about dentists.",
        "Is that Adam speaking, or is that Christ?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'exposition' side of the mix so that the contemporary examples serve to illuminate the text's depth rather than just illustrating a general concept."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'misery' (Adam/sin) and 'redemption' (Christ/life sentence) are clearly present. 'Gratitude' is framed as the 'newness of life' and ethical action. The preacher correctly identifies misery not as a psychological state but as a 'bondage' before God.",
      "quotes": [
        "None of us is innocent of sin because we were all born in bondage to it.",
        "In Christ, we have all received a life sentence.",
        "This movement from death into life is the foundation for Christian ethics."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'gratitude' part more explicit as a response to the 'life sentence' to avoid the sermon ending on a purely indicative note without the imperative of the Spirit-led life."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon mentions 'condemnation' and 'death,' but it leans heavily toward a universalist tone ('acquittal and life for all men'). The seriousness of the 'narrow way' and the possibility of being 'lost' (temporal or eternal) is softened by the concluding assurance.",
      "quotes": [
        "Before God, we all deserve a death sentence. In Christ, we have all received a life sentence.",
        "You are not in Adam. You are in Christ."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'two ways' more sharply. If 'Adam' is a real power, the choice to 'walk in newness of life' must carry the weight of a life-or-death decision, as Dekker suggests."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is clearly Christocentric. Christ is the telos, and the preacher emphasizes that righteousness is 'outside ourselves.' The distinction between human kindness and God's grace is well-maintained.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is not our righteousness, it is his righteousness.",
        "Man has no life in himself, it is Christ who is his life. [Paraphrased from text: 'pointing beyond ourselves to Christ']"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly link Christ's two natures to the 'life sentence' to ground the grace in dogmatic reality as Dekker requires."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1450 words, the sermon likely lasts 14-15 minutes. According to Thesis 8, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for 'depth.' The analysis of the text is sacrificed for the sake of multiple contemporary illustrations.",
      "quotes": [
        "<Word count calculation: ~1450 words / 100 = 14.5 minutes>"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical portion to reach the 20-minute threshold, allowing the 'depth' of Romans 6 to be fully explored."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily due to its lack of rigorous exegesis and its brevity. It functions more as a theological commentary on current events than an 'exposition' of a specific Bible passage. While it successfully avoids 'general truths' through concrete contemporary examples, it fails to unearth what is unique to Romans 6. The 'two ways' are obscured by a strong emphasis on universal acquittal.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application: The use of the Rizzo case and the dental care example provides the 'true truth' Dekker demands.",
      "Theological clarity: The distinction between the 'old Adam' and the 'new creation' is sharp and unsentimental."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of original languages/exegesis: The preacher does not demonstrate the 'requirement of exposition' (Hebrew/Greek/Context).",
      "Insufficient length: At 14 minutes, it lacks the 'breadth' required for homiletical depth.",
      "Thematic rather than textual: It treats Romans as a series of ideas rather than a specific, current Word."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an 'adequate' speech (Score: 5.5) but struggles to meet Dekker's formal definition of a sermon. It is too short, lacks exegetical depth, and risks becoming a 'speech about the gospel' rather than a recreation of the specific Bible passage into a new, current word."
