    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is exceptionally strong in evoking concrete, painful experiences. It avoids abstract 'sin' and instead paints vivid, visceral pictures of suffering. The hearer is immediately confronted with the physical reality of the Passion, mirrored in contemporary victims. It facilitates a deep emotional connection by linking the 'beaten Christ' to specific human fates (tourism victims, displaced indigenous people, battered wives).",
      "quotes": [
        "Mit dem Schürhaken des Mannes, der sich eine Frau zum Prügeln hält?",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Reflection is handled through a series of provocative questions that force the hearer to analyze their own position. The sermon pauses at the 'why' of the human condition, specifically examining the mechanism of the 'scapegoat' and the 'spectator.' It critiques the cultural comfort of the 'First World' and the psychological distance we maintain from suffering.",
      "quotes": [

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Theological depth is present but unconventional. It doesn't follow a traditional dogmatic structure. Instead, it redefines theological concepts like 'Truth' and 'God' through the lens of the Passion. The 'big idea' is that God is found exclusively in the suffering and the powerless. However, traditional exegesis is secondary to the thematic application of the text.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase in terms of specific 'how-to' steps. While the sermon is highly 'activist' in tone, the calls to action are broad and radical (standing with the poor, going to prison, stopping the arms race). It lacks a bridge for the average hearer to implement these truths in a non-radicalized daily context. It invites change but provides few 'small' steps.",

    "summary": "This sermon is a powerful example of prophetic-visionary preaching that excels in the first half of Kolb's cycle. It masterfully facilitates Concrete Experience and Reflective Observation by weaving the biblical Passion into the 'passion of the world.' It falls short in providing a balanced movement toward Active Experimentation for a diverse congregation. The language is sober yet evocative, avoiding clichés while delivering a sharp critique of 'First World' apathy. It is a 'Diverging' style sermon that prioritizes empathy and imagination over practical utility or dogmatic systematicity.",

      "Use more 'Declarative' logic to explain the theological necessity of the cross",
      "Bridge the gap between 'global victim' and 'local hearer' more gently"
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a strong, challenging piece of homiletic art that succeeds in making the hearer 'feel' the weight of the Passion. From a Kolb perspective, it is a masterclass in Concrete Experience and Reflective Observation. However, its diagnostic strength is also its practical weakness: it identifies the 'sickness' of the world with such intensity that the 'cure' (Active Experimentation) feels out of reach for most. It is an excellent example of prophetic preaching, but it requires a follow-up that focuses on the 'how' of Christian living in the aftermath of such a vision."
