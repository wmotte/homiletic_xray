It utilizes an Adult-to-Adult transaction to validate the listener's anxiety (chaos) while providing a framework for agency (speech). It avoids the common Good Friday trap of using the Critical Parent to induce guilt, focusing instead on the 'Free Child's' capacity for hutzpah and the 'Adult's' capacity for reality-testing.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to frame the 'call to action' as an invitation to authentic expression (Free Child) rather than a religious obligation (Adapted Child)."
