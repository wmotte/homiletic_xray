    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust, primarily operating from a healthy Adult ego state that validates the Free Child's need for wonder. It avoids the common 'Critical Parent' trap of many sermons by framing the 'Law' not as a crushing weight but as a 'summons' to authentic action. The contrast between the 'memo' (rigid Adult/Parent) and the 'poem' (Free Child) provides a helpful framework for listeners to identify their own psychological rigidity.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong appeal to listener autonomy and imagination.",

      "High integration of Adult reasoning with Free Child joy."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the 'summons' (Section IV) is abrupt and risks triggering the Adapted Child's fear of punishment.",
      "The use of 'reptiles' and 'lowlifes'—even via John the Baptist—can activate the Critical Parent."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To remain entirely game-free, ensure the 'summons' to action is framed as a natural expression of the Free Child's joy rather than a Parent's threat of the 'fire'."
