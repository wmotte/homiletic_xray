        "score": 7,
        "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates solid exegetical grounding, particularly in the contextualization of 2 Corinthians. The 'Sache' is the Trinitarian nature of God, defined not as a mathematical puzzle but as 'dynamic interrelatedness'. The preacher successfully bridges the gap between dogmatic formula and existential reality. In the second part, the analysis of Psalm 130 and the critique of the liturgical removal of 'no health in us' provides a sharp, dogmatic edge. The theological depth is found in the paradox that forgiveness leads to 'fear' (reverence), a Barthian-adjacent move that respects the 'wholly other' nature of God's mercy. However, the exegesis remains somewhat illustrative rather than strictly analytical.",
        "quotes": [
          "The inmost being of God is a dynamic interrelatedness that pours itself out for the other without ceasing.",
          "The forgiveness of sins does not leave us with a cheerful, domestic idea of God.",
          "The removal of this line has robbed us of a powerful buttress to the biblical concept of sin as a 'vast primordial catastrophe'."

        "score": 6,
        "analysis": "The preacher reveals a personality that values tradition, liturgical rigor, and emotional depth. There is a palpable 'green' signal of pastoral concern. The 'I' is largely diaconal, serving the text, though a slight 'compulsive' (Riemann) preference for liturgical correctness and 'the old ways' (1976 prayer book) leaks through. This is not ego-driven but stems from a conviction that the old forms better protected the truth of the Gospel. The preacher appears as a 'reliable guide' who has wrestled with the 'depths' mentioned in the Psalm.",

          "The removal of this line has robbed us...",
          "In desperation he writes an impassioned, erratic letter...",

        "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Depressive. Compulsive in the desire for structural and liturgical integrity ('there is no health in us'); Depressive in the high value placed on relational closeness and the 'parental' metaphor for God.",
        "diaconal_quality": "High. The preacher's personal preferences for liturgy are used to highlight the 'Sache' of God's mercy, not to self-aggrandize.",

        "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher-Student' or 'Elder-Congregation'. The 'we-definition' is strong, particularly in the confession of sin ('with all of us'). However, there is a paternalistic undertone in the opening illustration (parent/child). While effective for empathy, it places the preacher/God in the position of the 'worried parent' and the congregation in the position of the 'self-destructive child'. This creates a slight 'from above' dynamic. The 'yellow' signal is one of solidary gravity—we are all in the 'depths' together.",

      "appeal_aspect_red": {
        "score": 8,
        "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest side. The preacher masterfully navigates the Law/Gospel (Anspruch/Zuspruch) tension. The appeal is not to 'do better' but to 'be honest' and 'trust'. The 'red' side is a call to faith, which is theologically the highest form of appeal. By insisting on the 'miserable offender' status, the preacher isn't demanding moral effort but is clearing the ground for the 'Zuspruch' of God's radical grace. The appeal is: 'Stop trying to stand on your own merits and fall into the mercy of God.'",
        "quotes": [
          "This is not self-abasement leading to paralysis; this is honesty leading to deliverance.",

    "overall_picture": {
      "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
      "summary": "This sermon is a sophisticated example of homiletical 'depth-sounding'. It avoids the superficiality of modern 'self-help' preaching by leaning into the 'vast primordial catastrophe' of sin, only to find the 'plenteous redemption' of the Trinity. Psychologically, it uses the 'parent-child' dynamic to ground the abstract doctrine of the Trinity, though it risks a paternalistic relationship definition. Theologically, it is deeply Barthian in its refusal to turn God into a 'domestic' object; God remains the Acting Subject who pursues the sinner. The congruence between the preacher's sober tone and the weighty subject matter creates a sense of authority and trust. The sermon's greatest strength is its refusal to simplify the Gospel into moralism, maintaining the tension between the 'fear of the Lord' and 'joyous liberation'.",
      "barthian_warning": "Low risk. The preacher avoids psychologizing God. God is not a projection of human needs but the 'Someone' who 'pursues us'.",

        "Masterful balance of Law and Gospel.",
        "Existential translation of Trinitarian dogma.",

      "top_3_improvement_points": [
        "Soften the paternalistic hierarchy in the opening analogy.",
        "Ensure the 'green' side (personal nostalgia) doesn't overshadow the 'blue' (theological truth).",
        "More explicit Christological focus in the Psalm 130 section."
      ],
      "conclusion": "A strong, communicatively integral sermon that serves the 'Sache' with psychological intelligence and theological rigor."
