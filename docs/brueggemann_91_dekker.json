As a result they were drawing big crowds of people who were [...] This is an ancient story; it is at the same time a contemporary story. It turns out to be our story of the big resurrection and the many mini-resurrections that are enacted in its wake. It is no wonder that the authorities had their breath taken away."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Acts 4 as a springboard for a general narrative about 'resurrection power' versus 'empire.' It fails Dekker's requirement of finding what is in THIS text that is nowhere else. The preacher treats the text as a generic example of a 'counter-authority' movement rather than a specific word from God.",
      "quotes": [
        "The reference is back to the beginning of chapter 3",
        "This is an ancient story; it is at the same time a contemporary story."

      "improvement_point": "Identify the specific theological weight of Peter's speech in Acts 4:12 regarding the exclusivity of salvation, rather than reducing it to a general 'good deed' that makes authorities nervous."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is a basic reconstruction of the conflict between the apostles and the Sanhedrin. However, the exegesis is sociologically driven rather than linguistically or theologically grounded in the specificities of the Lukan narrative. The mention of 'Annas' and 'Scribes' provides a veneer of context, but the depth is lacking.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is the local power structure that owed its life and its status to the authority of the empire.",
        "These are the religious leaders who were in collusion with the status quo of the superpower, Rome."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The application is remarkably vague and general, which Dekker explicitly forbids. Phrases like 'mini-resurrections' and 'health reform' remain abstract metaphors. There is no concrete analysis of the contemporary 'zeitgeist' or specific congregational challenges.",
      "quotes": [
        "You also are authorized to perform mini-resurrections that restore life",
        "If you want to talk about health care and health reform... this is the Jesus whom you executed"

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher successfully mixes the narrative of Acts with contemporary terminology throughout. The hearer is drawn into the scene in Jerusalem as if it were a modern political trial. However, because both exposition and application are thin, the 'present of revelation' remains weak.",

        "He mocks the authorities, because he is not intimidated. Well, I will answer your question about the source of our action"

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon focuses almost exclusively on 'redemption' (as empowerment) and 'gratitude' (as action). The 'misery' is externalized as the 'Empire' or 'status quo,' rather than the misery of the human condition before God. It leans toward a 'Christocentric-as-example' model which Dekker warns against.",
      "quotes": [
        "The apostles have performed a mini-resurrection. They have rehabilitated a disabled guy",

      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "There is no sense of being 'lost' in an eternal or even a serious temporal sense. The 'Empire' is a foil, but the hearer is never brought to the point of a life-or-death decision. Life is treated more like a 'vacation' of performing good deeds than a journey with a destination.",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the 'Easter guy' and the 'source,' but he functions more as a catalyst for human 'empowered obedience' than as the God-man who is the telos of all life. Grace is framed as 'juices of life' rather than the radical salvation of a sinner.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is the Easter guy whom imperial execution could not limit.",

      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "At approximately 850 words, the sermon would last roughly 8-9 minutes. According to Thesis 8, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for 'depth.' It is a speech or a meditation, not a sermon.",

  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text falls short of being a sermon according to Dekker's criteria, primarily due to its brevity and its transformation of a specific biblical witness into a general political allegory. It lacks the 'three parts' in their proper depth, particularly the reality of human misery before God, and ignores the 'two ways' by presenting a safe, empowering narrative that lacks the urgency of salvation.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective interweaving of the biblical narrative with modern political categories.",
      "Clear focus on the 'name of Jesus' as the stated source of power."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Duration is significantly below the 20-minute threshold required for depth.",
      "Application is vague and relies on metaphors ('mini-resurrections') rather than concrete life situations.",
      "Theological reductionism: Christ is presented as a 'source of energy' rather than the Lord and Savior in a Trinitarian sense."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is a brief, topical address that uses a biblical story to illustrate a general idea of social empowerment. It lacks the specific exegetical depth, the necessary length for substantive proclamation, and the gravity of the 'two ways'."
