    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon relies heavily on biblical imagery (wine, wedding, banquet) but treats them primarily as theological categories rather than sensory realities. While it mentions 'the massive wine jars filled to the brim,' it fails to 'paint the picture' in a way that evokes the smell of the wine or the sound of the celebration. It follows Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' only in its citations of Isaiah, not in its own prose. The imagery is borrowed from the text but not aesthetically expanded. It remains at the level of 'explaining the image' rather than 'evoking the image.' The potential for a 'cinematic' experience of the Cana wedding is sacrificed for a lecture on Johannine symbolism.",
      "quotes": [
        "The image of a great feast... is prominent in the Old Testament.",
        "A feast of rich food, a feast of well-aged wines, of rich food filled with marrow.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise, scholarly, and exhibits high 'stewardship of language' in the sense of McEntyre. It avoids sloppy clichés and 'Canaanite' jargon, opting instead for clear theological definitions (doxa, telos, semeion). However, the precision is academic rather than poetic. It functions well as a teaching document but lacks the 'loving language' that connects to the specific nuances of a contemporary hearer's life. The word choice is deliberate and hits the core of the Johannine intent, but the tone is somewhat detached.",
      "quotes": [
        "John’s purpose, as throughout his Gospel, is theological.",
        "The 'hour' is not a day on the calendar. It is the time of the fulfillment of Jesus’ destiny.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The rhythm is that of an essay or a commentary. Sentences are often long and explanatory, lacking the staccato/legato variation necessary for effective oral delivery. There is little use of rhetorical figures like alliteration or parallelism to aid memorability. It reads as 'paper language'—logical and sequential, but without the 'cadence' that Immink suggests is necessary for the 'holy to happen' in time. The flow is interrupted by academic citations (e.g., 'Rudolf Bultmann observes...'), which kills the homiletical momentum.",
      "quotes": [
        "The sequence of readings in the Epiphany season is worth noting.",
        "Clearly this is meant as an appeal not only to John’s contemporary readers, but also to listeners throughout the ages...",

    "average_score_language": 5.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by academic precision and theological clarity but lacks the sensory depth and rhythmic vitality required for a high aesthetic score. It functions as an 'instructional' text rather than a 'poetic' event. While it avoids kitsch and sloppy jargon, it fails to 'show' the beauty of the Cana miracle, opting instead to 'explain' its mechanics. The stewardship of language is high in terms of truth-telling, but low in terms of aesthetic evocation."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The structure is a static, thematic enumeration ('First...', 'The second feature...', 'A third feature...'). There is no 'upsetting of the equilibrium' or 'Lowry-esque' plot. The sermon does not take the hearer on a journey from a problem to a solution; rather, it presents a series of theological observations. The tension is minimal. While it mentions the 'hour' of the cross as a turning point in John's Gospel, the sermon itself lacks a palpable turning point or a sense of movement. It feels like a standstill analysis of a moving text.",
      "quotes": [
        "First, at the wedding, Jesus manifests himself.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is excellent at 'text-to-text' integration (linking John to Isaiah and the Prayer Book), but 'text-to-context' integration is almost entirely absent. There is no mention of the contemporary world, the hearer's needs, or how the 'lavish feast' reframes our current reality of scarcity or 'lack of wine.' Cilliers' concept of 'reframing' is present only in a theoretical sense—we are told that the miracle is a sign, but the hearer's reality is not actually reframed by the preaching. The 'context' remains the liturgical season of Epiphany, not the lived experience of the congregation.",
      "quotes": [
        "Clearly this is meant as an appeal... to listeners throughout the ages and to this day.",
        "There is an outcry in the streets for lack of wine (Isaiah 24:11).",

        "Show how the 'prodigal generosity' of God challenges contemporary consumerism or despair."

      "reframing_present": "No. It confirms a theological frame but does not reframe a contemporary life-context."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is 'closed' in its theological conclusions—it tells the hearer exactly what to believe and how to interpret the sign. However, it earns a slightly higher score because it respects the 'mystery' of the divine being and the 'not yet' of the eschatological feast. It avoids the 'kitsch' of a happy ending by pointing to the Cross. Yet, there is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or for the hearer to interpret the sign for themselves. It is a 'monovalent' work that functions as a lecture on the 'correct' interpretation.",
      "quotes": [
        "The central purpose is to do what the season of Epiphany does—to reveal the glory of Jesus.",
        "John is not at all interested in what the other guests at the wedding might have thought.",
        "The church... is to point to Christ’s glory, and let his glory take care of itself."

      "strengths": [
        "Honors the mystery of the 'hour' and the 'glory'.",
        "Resists the urge to turn the miracle into a simple moral lesson.",
        "The ending is somewhat open, leaving the 'work' of the glory to God."

        "Ask questions that invite the hearer into the scene (e.g., 'Where do you see the wine running out?').",

        "Create 'space' for the hearer to respond to the 'invitation to behold and believe'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly closed. It is a didactic exposition that leaves little room for polyvalence."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 5.0,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is predominantly didactic and static. By organizing the sermon around 'four features,' the preacher creates a clear but uninspiring lecture format. The lack of a narrative arc or contemporary context prevents the sermon from becoming an 'event' in the sense of Immink. While the theological integration of the Old and New Testaments is strong, the failure to bridge the gap to the hearer's current reality results in a structure that feels more like a commentary than a sermon."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon's greatest aesthetic strength is its rigorous avoidance of religious kitsch. It explicitly warns against 'sentimentalization' (the 'nice Jesus' who just wants people to be happy). It refuses to offer a cheap 'happy ending,' instead grounding the joy of the wedding in the 'paradox of suffering' at the Cross. The emotions are not pre-chewed; they are tied to the 'intense sense of purpose' and 'divine power' of Christ. By maintaining the tension between the feast and the sacrifice, it achieves authentic theological depth.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential sentimentalization: 'how nice that Jesus wanted everyone to be happy!'"
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The connection of the wedding wine to the 'hour' of the cross.",
      "The use of Isaiah's 'shroud cast over all peoples' to ground the miracle in the reality of death."

    "recommendation": "Maintain this theological rigor but allow 'authentic emotion' (wonder, awe, longing) to be expressed through more poetic language."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace through the theme of 'exuberant and prodigal generosity.' The sermon successfully portrays God as the giver of an 'inexhaustible bounty.' However, the space is somewhat constricted by the academic delivery. While the *content* is about grace, the *form* is about instruction. The 'mystery' is respected, but it is explained rather than experienced. It avoids moralization (a major plus), but it doesn't quite achieve the 'phenomenological opening' Cilliers describes because it remains in the realm of ideas.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between the 'already' of the wine and the 'not yet' of the cross is well sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, the divinity and 'doxa' of Jesus are treated with appropriate reverence.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. There are almost no moral imperatives, which is a rare and strong Reformed aesthetic quality.",
    "recommendation": "Use more 'open' language and imagery to allow the hearer to actually *feel* the space of grace being offered."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 5.5,
    "summary": "This sermon (or sermon-essay) is a work of high theological integrity but low aesthetic 'eventfulness.' It excels in Domain A2 (Precision) and in its 'Anti-Kitsch' stance, providing a sober, Reformed-inflected analysis of the Johannine text. It avoids the common pitfalls of sentimentalism and moralism, which is commendable. However, it fails significantly in Domain B1 (Narrative Arc) and A3 (Musicality). The structure is that of a classroom lecture, which 'tells' the hearer about the glory of God without 'showing' it or allowing the hearer to participate in the 'happening' of the holy. The lack of contemporary context (B2) makes it feel like a museum piece—beautifully preserved and accurately labeled, but not a living 'reframing' of the hearer's world. It is a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that values truth over beauty, forgetting that in homiletics, the form *is* the content.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rigorous avoidance of sentimental kitsch.",
      "Deep and accurate biblical-theological synthesis (John/Isaiah).",
      "Clear and precise use of theological terminology (doxa/semeion)."

      "Transform the static 'list' structure into a dynamic narrative arc.",
      "Incorporate sensory, 'showing' language to evoke the biblical scene.",
      "Bridge the 'text-context' gap by applying the 'reframing' to contemporary life."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Academic-Declarative / Sober-Reformed",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Thomas G. Long's 'Witness' model (focus on the text's form), but lacks the 'Imagery' of Paul Scott Wilson or the 'Dramaturgy' of Lowry.",
    "audience_analysis": "Theologically literate hearers, students, or those who prefer intellectual clarity over emotional or narrative engagement.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Read the text aloud during drafting to identify and break up 'paper language' sentences.",
      "Start the sermon in the 'middle of the mess' (the lack of wine) to create immediate tension.",
      "Find one contemporary 'image' that acts as a bridge between the Cana wedding and the current world."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically 'safe' but 'dry' exercise. It protects the holiness of the Word from kitsch but fails to clothe it in the 'radiant brightness' it discusses. It is a 5.5: it 'meets' the requirements of a theological address but falls short of the 'aesthetic turn' which demands that the sermon itself be a 'space for grace' and an 'open work of art.' It is more of a commentary than a performance."
