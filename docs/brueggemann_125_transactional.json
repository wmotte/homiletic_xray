    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely game-free. It utilizes a strong Adult ego state to provide historical and linguistic context, which prevents the message from becoming purely emotional or coercive. By acknowledging the patriarchal nature of the biblical text, the preacher maintains Adult-to-Adult transparency. The use of 'Free Child' imagery (pregnancy, dancing, wine) serves to energize the listener rather than infantilize them. The transition from the 'despair' of the past to the 'possibility' of the future is handled without the 'Bait and Switch' game, as the 'cost' (responsibility and action) is clearly stated at the end.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of Adult transparency regarding text difficulties.",
      "Avoids the 'Ain't It Awful' trap despite discussing social upheaval.",
      "Promotes autonomy and agency ('we can act')."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Rescuer' role is slightly present in the idealization of the 'Dream,' which can occasionally lead to a 'Victim' payoff if the dream feels too distant for the listener."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to validate the 'Adult' of the listener by providing historical context, and keep the 'Free Child' imagery grounded in the 'Here-and-Now' of the city's specific needs."
