    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating sensory landscapes. It effectively contrasts the 'bright sunshine' of Palm Sunday with the 'midday midnight' of Calvary. The preacher uses visual and tactile details—the 'stench' is implied through the 'ragtag retinue' and the 'work-hardened body' of Jesus. This aligns with Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' by painting the southern slope of Olivet and the marble of the temple. The imagery of the 'disheveled beggar' in London provides a concrete human anchor for the abstract concept of missed potential. However, some metaphors occasionally border on the conventional ('the road rises to meet us'), slightly dampening the impact of the more original descriptions.",
      "quotes": [
        "the awful fury of all hell will be loosed in the midday midnight of Calvary's hill",
        "the immaculate marble of the temple and the pinnacles of the city's palaces",

        "Effective use of light and shadow as a recurring visual motif.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strongly leans toward 'showing' the scene of Jerusalem and the physical reaction of Jesus, though 'tells' the moral application in the middle section."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is dignified and largely avoids 'Canaanite' jargon, opting for a more literary-existential vocabulary ('pathos,' 'epitaph,' 'tribunals'). There is a clear stewardship of words in the descriptions of Jesus' character ('austere majesty,' 'royal purposefulness'). However, the sermon occasionally slips into alliterative 'pious pap'—ironically using that exact phrase while elsewhere employing somewhat repetitive adjectives. The precision is highest when describing the internal state of the hearer ('nameless sadness,' 'flight from God'). The middle section on social issues becomes slightly more generalized, losing the sharp precision found in the opening and closing movements.",
      "quotes": [
        "It was with no sickly sentimentalism, no pious pap, no pale politeness",
        "the petty tribunals we set up of dying men and women whose dust will soon be blown by every vagrant wind",
        "a concert of ethnicity, each bringing the rich notes of his, her origins"

        "Refine the 'American undertaking' section to be as linguistically rich as the 'Calvary' section."

      "jargon_analysis": "Low jargon; the preacher translates theological concepts into psychological and social realities."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is highly musical, designed clearly for the ear. It utilizes 'staccato' for emphasis ('Christ weeps, my heart melts. Christ weeps, my will is broken') and 'legato' for narrative flow. The repetition of 'not yet' and 'Christ weeps' creates a liturgical cadence that builds emotional momentum. The use of the spiritual 'Sometimes it causes me to tremble' adds a melodic, haunting quality to the text. The rhythm mimics the 'measured' mood the preacher describes. It avoids 'paper language' entirely, favoring the rhythmic pulse of classical oratory. This is the sermon's strongest micro-aesthetic feature.",
      "quotes": [
        "Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble.",
        "The sands have not run out, not yet. There in the darkness on Calvary where Jesus died, God made a statement.",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high degree of micro-aesthetic awareness. It moves beyond abstract dogma by painting vivid, often dark, sensory pictures of both the biblical narrative and modern life. The language is rhythmic and oratorical, clearly intended for a communal 'event' of hearing. While it occasionally flirts with rhetorical flourishes that feel slightly dated, the precision of its existential descriptions and the musicality of its conclusion create a compelling aesthetic experience that honors the 'stewardship of language'."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by upsetting the equilibrium of the 'happy' Palm Sunday with the 'shadow' of the cross. It moves from the 'trouble' of the city (Jerusalem/the modern city) to the 'grace' of the weeping Christ. The turning point is the transition from the 'searching judgment' to the 'stubborn refusal to write it all off.' The energy does not drop; rather, it intensifies toward the end, moving from the macro (nations/history) to the micro (the individual soul). However, the middle section on social issues feels somewhat like a detour that slows the narrative momentum before the final ascent to the cross.",
      "quotes": [
        "Only there is a shadow over it all.",
        "The awful option of life or death hangs over this day.",
        "I will not hint it. I will say it boldly. The old, pursuing, persisting love of God has not given up on you..."

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The integration is functional but somewhat traditional. The preacher 'reframes' the Palm Sunday entry as a 'final offering' and a 'final chance,' which allows for a bridge to the hearer's own 'missed opportunities.' The connection between Jerusalem and 'your city, my city' is a classic homiletical move. The use of the London beggar and American social issues attempts to ground the text, but these feel more like 'illustrations' than a deep 'reframing' of reality through the text. The 'strangeness' of the donkey and the palms is quickly traded for the 'familiarity' of modern social struggle. It confirms the hearer’s sense of a broken world rather than radically reorienting their perception of it.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus has the courage to face the city, Jerusalem, your city, my city, and every city.",
        "One wonders if slothfulness, an empty swagger... are to be the fate of our black community",
        "The mood of Palm Sunday, then... is an authentic sample of our lives"

        "Honest acknowledgment of the 'shadows' in contemporary life.",
        "Direct application to the hearer's internal sense of failure.",
        "Avoids 'then-and-there' escapism by insisting on the 'here-and-now'."

        "Move beyond 'illustration' to a more profound 'reframing' of how grace operates in the city.",

        "Respect the 'strangeness' of the biblical narrative longer before jumping to contemporary parallels."

      "reframing_present": "Provides a new frame for the 'tears of God' but largely confirms the 'old frame' of human brokenness."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is a 'closed' work of art in the traditional sense. While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (lights and shadows), the conclusion is highly directive and rhetorical. The preacher answers the questions he raises, leading the hearer toward a specific emotional response ('That wins me forever. Does it you?'). While the 'Space for Grace' is opened by the image of the weeping Jesus, the rhetorical structure 'seals' the meaning. There is little room for the hearer to interpret the 'tears' differently; they are defined as the 'very heart of God.' It is a monovalent call to surrender rather than a polyvalent invitation to wonder.",
      "quotes": [
        "The divine right of kings... Aryan supremacy. There is an all-seeing eye. God is still on the throne.",
        "I will not hint it. I will say it boldly.",
        "Christ weeps! That wins me forever. Does it you?"

        "Allow for more 'open endings' that let the hearer sit with the judgment before the mercy.",
        "Reduce the 'coercive' nature of the final rhetorical questions.",
        "Leave some aspects of the 'tears' unexplained to invite the hearer's own appropriation."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A monovalent, closed work of art that uses high rhetoric to drive toward a single, specific response."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon's structure is a well-crafted narrative journey that effectively moves from the public spectacle of Palm Sunday to the private interiority of the soul. It follows a classic 'trouble-to-grace' arc, maintaining tension through the motif of 'shadows.' However, it lacks the 'openness' of modern aesthetic theory, functioning more as a persuasive rhetorical event than an 'open work of art.' The integration of context is broad but sometimes lacks the specific 'reframing' power that would make the biblical text feel truly new."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon narrowly avoids religious kitsch by refusing to offer a 'happy ending' without the 'midday midnight' of the cross. It takes the 'pain of suffering' and the 'fury of hell' seriously. However, it flirts with kitsch in its use of 'Jesus, meek and mild' (even while critiquing it) and the somewhat sentimentalized 'sobbing Savior' imagery. The 'disheveled beggar' is a borderline clichéd illustration. Authentic depth is found in the insistence that the mood of the church must remain 'somber, grave, measured' despite the hosannas. The emotion feels largely authentic because it is rooted in the 'work-hardened body' and 'visible shudders' rather than just 'pious pap'.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'road rises to meet us' and 'morning wind blows gently' section feels like a Hallmark card.",
      "The 'disheveled beggar' in London is a standard, almost pre-chewed homiletical trope."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'midday midnight' and the 'horror of the death of the Son of God'.",
      "The refusal to 'write it all off' while acknowledging the 'cutoff point' of opportunity."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To increase depth, replace the 'beggar' illustration with a more specific, less 'literary' example of human failure, and lean further into the 'austere majesty' of Jesus to balance the 'sobbing' imagery."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'reframing' of the Palm Sunday entry as a site of divine vulnerability. By focusing on the 'tears' of Jesus, the preacher creates a 'Space for Grace' that is not based on human effort but on divine 'Inter-esse'—God being in the midst of human failure. However, the space is partially 'closed' by the moralizing tone in the social commentary section and the prescriptive nature of the conclusion. The 'mystery' of the tears is respected, but the 'mystery' of the city's judgment is explained away with historical examples.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'already' (hosannas) and 'not yet' (Calvary) is well-sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'inexpressible sight' of the weeping Savior honors the mystery of the Incarnation.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the final movement, though moralization dominates the middle section.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'judgment' of the city to remain a more 'open' question, avoiding the neat historical list of 'punished' evils, to keep the space for God's sovereign action wider."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of the 'New Homiletic' before it fully embraced the 'open work' concept. It is aesthetically rich in its use of imagery and rhythm, creating a 'cinematic' experience of the Palm Sunday entry. The preacher successfully 'paints the picture' of a Savior who is neither bland nor passive, but 'austere' and 'tender.' The primary aesthetic strength lies in the poetics of language—specifically the musicality and the 'light and shadow' motif. Structurally, it is a compelling journey, though it suffers from a slightly dated 'closed' rhetorical style that seeks to manage the hearer's response through high-intensity emotional appeals. It avoids the worst traps of religious kitsch by anchoring its sentiment in the 'grim things in the offing' and the physical reality of the cross. While it opens a significant 'Space for Grace' through the image of the weeping Christ, it occasionally clutters that space with social generalizations and moralizing lists. Overall, it is a well-considered, aesthetically 'sober' yet 'moving' piece of Reformed-adjacent oratory.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional musicality and rhythmic cadence, especially in the conclusion.",
      "Vivid, sensory imagery that contrasts the 'sunshine' of the entry with the 'midnight' of the cross.",
      "Authentic emotional depth achieved through the physical description of the 'sobbing Savior'."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduce the 'closedness' of the structure to allow more room for the hearer's own interpretation.",
      "Prune clichéd illustrations (the beggar, the Irish blessing) to avoid 'kitsch' territory.",
      "Better integrate the social commentary so it feels like 'reframing' rather than a 'detour'."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Poetic-Imagistic with a Narrative-Dramatic arc.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Imagery' and 'Four Pages' approach of Paul Scott Wilson, combined with the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who appreciate literary quality, emotional depth, and a sense of 'dignified' worship will be most appealed to.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending'—perhaps ending with the tears of Jesus without the final 'wins me' resolution.",
      "Use more specific, contemporary 'images' of the city that aren't as 'literary' as a London beggar.",
      "Read the text aloud to identify where the 'triple-alliterations' might sound too performative."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically effective event that honors the 'aesthetic turn' by making the 'how' of the message—the tears, the shadows, the rhythm—central to the 'what' of grace. It is a 'sober beauty' that avoids superficiality, even if it remains rhetorically 'closed.' It serves as a strong example of how imagery can be used to sustain the tension between judgment and mercy."
