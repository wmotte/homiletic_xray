    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in eschatological preaching. By utilizing a strong Adult ego position, the preacher processes a national tragedy without exploiting it for emotional leverage. The refusal to engage in a 'moralistic reading' prevents the congregation from falling into an Adapted Child (guilt-based) response. Instead, the preacher models a healthy Nurturing Parent/Adult synthesis that validates human frailty while pointing toward communal resilience.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'We' pronoun to include yourself in human frailty, as this prevents the 'I'm OK, You're Not OK' dynamic that triggers games like ITHY."
