    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's primary requirement of being an exposition of *one specific* passage. It is a thematic collage of Paul's letters and the Psalms. It treats 'the gospel' or 'grace' as a general idea rather than letting a single pericope dictate the specificity of God's Word. It lacks the 'nowhere else' quality because it draws from everywhere.",
      "quotes": [
        "As the Apostle’s letter was being read, we heard him say...",
        "Note, however, and carefully analyze Paul’s thinking...",
        "Accordingly, the psalm I just mentioned begins...",
        "You’ll find out in the same passage. Having exclaimed... the Apostle immediately adds..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one pericope (e.g., Galatians 5:16-21) and restrict the sermon to its unique logic rather than using it as a springboard to jump between 2 Corinthians, Romans, and various Psalms."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "There is no historical-critical exposition. The 'original context' is treated as a flat, timeless theological landscape. While the preacher mentions Greek ('in Greek, the gospel'), it is a lexical observation rather than an analysis of the socio-religious history of Israel or the specific situation of the first readers.",
      "quotes": [
        "Paul was speaking to people who’d been baptized.",
        "Proclaim the good news (in Greek, the gospel)!"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the specific historical tension of the congregation being addressed (e.g., the conflict in Galatia or the context of post-exilic temple building) to ground the theology in history."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Application is largely psychological and spiritualized but remains general. It addresses 'man' in a universal sense rather than the contemporary hearer in a specific time and place. It lacks the 'cultural philosophy' or 'zeitgeist' analysis Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let’s annihilate these vices in ourselves, therefore, the way we’d smash idols.",
        "As for our limbs, they’re what we must consecrate to nobler uses..."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon performs reasonably well here. It does not separate 'the then' and 'the now' into distinct blocks; rather, it moves fluidly between the text and the hearer's inner struggle. The hearer is 'expounded' alongside the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "What happens, brothers, when earthly buildings are afterwards consecrated to nobler uses? ... And so it is with us.",
        "Flesh keeps fighting against spirit... with the result that you don’t do what you intend."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is strong on the 'three parts.' It focuses heavily on human misery (the struggle with the flesh), the necessity of redemption (grace through Christ), and the call to gratitude (singing the new song). It avoids over-objectification by focusing on the 'wretched soul.'",
      "quotes": [
        "What a wretched soul I am!",
        "We were sold and subjugated to sin, but we’ve since been freed by grace.",
        "Love singing a new song to the Lord... Sing as you build."

      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by connecting it to the 'lostness in time' (societal/collective) as well as the individual struggle."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon acknowledges the 'two ways' (destruction vs. kingdom), but the threat of being lost is softened by a focus on the inevitability of the struggle. It lacks the sharp 'ultimate possibility' of failure that Dekker emphasizes.",
      "quotes": [
        "Those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.",
        "You’re being fought; so fight back, and one of these days you’ll be the victor."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the reality of 'being lost in time'—the possibility that the hearer's life design may fail to answer God's calling."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon moves toward Christ as the only solution to the 'sting of death' and the 'power of sin.' Grace is presented as the deepest reality, detaching man from his own strength.",
      "quotes": [
        "What is his salvation but his Christ?",
        "Thanks be to God, who gives us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.",
        "Man has no life in himself, it is Christ who is his life."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly ground the 'two natures' of Christ more firmly in the exposition to support the claim that he is the divine Physician."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "At approximately 2200 words, the sermon meets the 20-minute threshold. It allows for the 'breadth' Miskotte requires, though the breadth is achieved through thematic jumping rather than deep drilling into a single text.",
      "improvement_point": "Use the 20+ minutes to exhaust the depths of *one* pericope rather than surveying the Pauline corpus."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's primary formal definition: it is not an exposition of a *specific* Bible passage but a thematic discourse on grace and struggle using various scriptures as proof-texts. It lacks historical-critical depth and contemporary cultural specificity. However, it succeeds in its psychological-theological depth, its commitment to the 'three parts' (misery, redemption, gratitude), and its clear Christological telos.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Trinitarian and Christocentric focus where Christ is the clear goal of the proclamation.",
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' to address the hearer's spiritual condition.",
      "Adequate length to allow for theological reflection."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of scriptural specificity; the sermon is a 'speech about the gospel' rather than a recreation of a specific text.",
      "Absence of concrete, contemporary application to the zeitgeist.",
      "Lack of historical-critical exegesis of the original context."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a strong theological address, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict sense of Dekker's theses because it lacks a specific pericope as its absolute starting point and unique source."
