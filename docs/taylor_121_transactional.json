  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically heavy and relies significantly on Critical Parent energy. While it addresses important themes of racial identity and institutional pride, it does so through shaming and 'NIGYSOB' games. The preacher creates a 'fear culture' by suggesting God may remove the church's power and by disparaging the congregation's current values. The transition from the biblical 'Jezebel' to modern gender-based shaming is a classic 'Switch' that targets the listener's sense of propriety.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult historical context in the introduction.",
      "Powerful use of Free Child imagery in personal anecdotes.",
      "High rhetorical energy that creates a sense of urgency."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on shaming (Critical Parent) to motivate change.",
      "Gender-biased judgments that create a 'Persecutor' dynamic.",
      "Lack of Adult-Adult invitation for the congregation to solve their own identity issues."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to move from 'I'm not interested in whether you like this' (Persecutor) to 'How do we, as a community, feel about our history?' (Adult). Replace shaming with an invitation to Free Child creativity in hero-making, rather than Adapted Child compliance to the preacher's list of heroes."
