    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a familiar liturgical experience (the Easter greeting) but quickly moves into a critique of modern attitudes. While it evokes the 'smell of death' and the specific grief of a hit-and-run victim, these experiences often serve as a foil for theological argument rather than a space for the hearer to simply 'be'. The identification with the women at the tomb is the strongest moment of concrete experience, grounding the miraculous in human sensory expectation.",
      "quotes": [
        "In my ministry I have learned to recognize the look, the feel, and the smell of death.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher analyzes why modern people feel 'sheepish' about their faith and critiques the 'timidity' of mainline preaching. There is a deep reflection on the 'why' of human skepticism and the inadequacy of 'generic hopes.' It pauses to look at the problem of death as a 'hostile, invading Power' rather than a natural transition.",
      "quotes": [
        "The cumulative result is to make Christians feel sheepish about their faith.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is theoretically robust. It makes a clear theological distinction between 'human possibility' and 'divine action.' The 'big idea' is the objectivity of the Resurrection as an act of God (the acting subject). It uses exegesis (the syntax of 'eyes were opened') and dogmatic frameworks (Christus Victor/battle imagery) to formulate a solid biblical truth.",
      "quotes": [
        "In the quotations from the sermons I just read, God is not the acting subject of any of the sentences.",
        "The syntax clearly indicates that their recognition of the risen Christ was initiated by God."

        "Strong emphasis on the 'theocentric' nature of the Resurrection.",

      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. The sermon concludes with a call to 'rejoice' and 'remember,' but offers very few concrete action steps for the hearer's daily life. The application remains largely internal and emotional/spiritual. It lacks a clear 'how will you do this now?' beyond the mental shift of believing the 'incredible message.'",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The sermon needs more 'Monday morning' applications: how does this victory change how one works, votes, or relates to neighbors?",

It succeeds in moving the hearer from a subjective, human-centered view of faith to an objective, God-centered one. However, it is structurally unbalanced, favoring intellectual and visionary elements over practical application. While it effectively uses narrative and cultural critique to ground its theological claims, it fails to provide the congregation with concrete ways to live out the 'victory' it so vividly describes. The tone is authoritative and occasionally polemical, which serves the 'Declarative' structure well but may miss the 'Pragmatic' needs of a modern audience looking for lived-out relevance.",

      "Use the 'Narrative' phase not just for the biblical story, but for a contemporary story of Resurrection power in action."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This is a strong, traditional Easter sermon that excels in theological conceptualization and visionary inspiration. It provides a necessary 'prophetic' correction to subjective views of the Resurrection. However, from a Kolb perspective, it is an incomplete learning cycle. It successfully moves the hearer to 'think' and 'feel' differently about the Resurrection, but it leaves them without a clear path to 'act' differently. The priority for improvement is the integration of the Pragmatic quadrant—converting the 'Hallelujah' of the sanctuary into the 'servant leadership' of the world."
