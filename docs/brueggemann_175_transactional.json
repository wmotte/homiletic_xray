  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 7,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically robust because it challenges the listener's Adult ego to process reality rather than just emoting. However, it flirts with the 'Ain't It Awful' game by spending significant time on a cynical (though perhaps accurate) portrayal of society. The impact is a high-pressure call to autonomy, which is a paradox: 'I command you to be free.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult engagement with biblical and contemporary data.",
      "Promotes autonomy by encouraging 'critical reflection' over 'busy-ness'.",
      "Identifies systemic anxiety as a psychological trap."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The Critical Parent tone regarding 'meat' and 'tweets' can feel like 'NIGYSOB' (Now I've Got You...).",
      "The transition from the 'Free Child' (lilies/birds) to the 'Parent' (vocation of justice) is abrupt."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward a 10/10 purity, the preacher could share more of his own 'Free Child' struggles with anxiety rather than speaking from a primarily 'Prophetic Parent' position. This would level the transaction to a true Adult-Adult partnership."
