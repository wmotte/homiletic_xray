There is a slight CP edge when discussing 'junk food' and 'narcoticized' culture, but it is directed at the 'voices' rather than the congregation.",

It invites the listener to process data (Deuteronomy, Moses, Jesus) and apply it to their current reality.

    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' By operating primarily from the Adult ego state, the preacher respects the listener's autonomy. The sermon reframes the biblical text from a magical/heroic story into a practical 'strategy' for identity maintenance. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Drama Triangle by refusing to play the Rescuer who provides easy answers to a Victim congregation. Instead, it offers 'resources' for the listener's own Adult processing.",

      "Could incorporate more 'Free Child' spontaneity to balance the heavy intellectual/Adult tone.",
      "The 'junk food' metaphor briefly flirts with a Critical Parent judgment of the culture."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'What if' questions to invite Adult reflection. Maintain the distinction between 'the voices' (external) and the listener's 'God-given humanity' (internal) to prevent the listener from slipping into an Adapted Child (guilt) response."
