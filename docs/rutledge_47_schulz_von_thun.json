    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The factual content is rooted in the 'Sache' of the O Antiphons—a sophisticated typological reading of the Old Testament as a precursor to Christ. The 'Blue' side is not presented through discursive argument but through the juxtaposition of medieval antiphons with their biblical sources. It provides a dense dogmatic framework: Christ as Wisdom, Adonai, Root, Key, Morning Star, King, and Emmanuel. The theological depth is high, reflecting the Barthian 'Living Christ' as the center of all scripture. However, the lack of explanatory bridges assumes a high level of biblical literacy in the congregation, potentially leaving the 'factual' ear overwhelmed by the sheer volume of symbolic data without a narrative thread to bind them.",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher/liturgist is almost entirely hidden behind the 'we' of the liturgy and the 'I' of the biblical texts. This is a highly 'diaconal' self-revelation where the ego is suppressed to serve the tradition. However, what 'leaks' is a strong preference for formal, high-church aesthetics and a 'Compulsive' (Riemann) need for structural symmetry and historical continuity. The preacher reveals themselves as a guardian of the 'sacred deposit' rather than a vulnerable witness. There is little 'Selbstenthüllung' (unintentional leaking) other than a palpable reverence for the medieval and Anglican choral tradition.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher/Guide to Congregation'. The use of 'Beloved in Christ' establishes a warm but formal bond. The 'We-definition' is strong ('we are met together'), suggesting a collective journey. However, the 'Yellow' signals are predominantly paternalistic. The preacher directs the congregation's movements and thoughts ('Let us therefore mark', 'Let us pray'). There is a 'Relationship Noise' risk: the archaic language ('wrought by him', 'Calvary’s tree') may signal to the modern hearer that this relationship is rooted in the past rather than the present reality.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily 'directional' rather than 'moralistic'. The 'Red' side calls the hearer to 'prepare', 'mark', and 'look expectantly'. The ratio of Zuspruch (Promise) to Anspruch (Demand) is well-balanced because the demands are liturgical/spiritual (prepare your heart) rather than behavioral. However, the Bidding Prayer contains a sharp 'Law' element regarding 'willful disobedience' and 'Judgment'. The theological success here is that the 'Appeal' is to wait for God’s action (Immink), not to save oneself. The risk is that the appeal becomes purely aesthetic—to 'enjoy' the service rather than to be transformed by the Word.",
      "quotes": [

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This 'sermon'—expressed through a liturgical sequence—is a masterclass in objective homiletics. It avoids the Barthian trap of 'unhealthy psychologization' by letting the biblical and liturgical texts speak for themselves. The psychological profile is 'Compulsive' in its adherence to structure, which provides a sense of security and 'fides quae' (the faith which is believed). However, from a Schulz von Thun perspective, the 'Green' and 'Yellow' sides are so formalized that they risk becoming 'Relationship Noise' for a modern audience seeking 'fides qua' (the faith by which one believes). The 'Sache' (Christ) is the acting subject, which satisfies the Immink/Barth criteria, but the communicative bridge to the listener's existential 'now' is thin. It is a beautiful, static icon of a sermon rather than a dynamic conversation.",
    "barthian_warning": "Minimal psychologization. God remains the Acting Subject, though the 'human experience' is perhaps too suppressed.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological integrity and Christocentric focus",
      "Excellent use of liturgical rhythm",

      "Bridge the 'Time Gap' to the modern listener",
      "Increase 'Green' authenticity to model the 'fides qua'",
      "Clarify the 'Red' appeal beyond liturgical participation"
    ],
    "conclusion": "A solid, traditional liturgical performance that excels in dogmatic clarity but lacks the 'razor-sharp' personal edge required for a 7+ score."
