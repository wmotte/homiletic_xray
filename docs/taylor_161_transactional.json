    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is a masterclass in 'Parent-Child' homiletics. While rhetorically brilliant and poetically moving, it relies heavily on the 'I'm OK, You're Not OK' dynamic. By emphasizing total human depravity and helplessness through the lens of extreme historical trauma, it bypasses the listener's Adult ego. The psychological impact is one of 'learned helplessness,' where the listener is made to feel like a 'Victim' in the Drama Triangle, with the Savior (and by extension, the preacher's message) as the only 'Rescuer.' This creates a dependency-based faith rather than an autonomous one.",

      "Use of 'shock' imagery (lynching/holocaust) to manipulate emotional states."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as 'Adults' who have the agency to partner with the Divine. Instead of 'You are unable,' try 'You are invited.' Reduce the use of 'must' and 'need to' (Parent) in favor of 'What do you see?' (Adult)."
