    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher addresses the 'Great White Throne Judgment' from Revelation 20. The factual content is centered on the inescapability of divine arbitration. Theologically, the preacher navigates the tension between God's eternal mercy (Psalm 103) and the reality of consequence. However, the 'Sache' (the living Christ) is somewhat overshadowed by the 'Sache' of judgment. While Barth would demand that Christ be the subject of the judgment, the sermon focuses heavily on the human state of 'spiritual desolation.' The exegetical depth is moderate; it uses the text as a springboard for existential warning rather than a deep dive into the apocalyptic genre. The distinction between the 'books' (works) and the 'Book of Life' (grace) is mentioned but not fully developed dogmatically.",
      "quotes": [
        "The dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened.",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a deeply pastoral, yet burdened heart. There is a palpable sense of 'earnestness and sincerity.' The green side 'leaks' a fear of pastoral failure—the haunting memory of 'Pops Swinton' suggests a preacher who carries the weight of those he could not reach. He reveals himself as a traditionalist who values the 'grandeur' of worship. There is no image management here; the preacher admits to being 'foolish enough' to be called a pastor. The self-revelation is diaconal because it uses personal memory (the fruitcake, the first church) not to aggrandize the 'I', but to illustrate the terrifying proximity of judgment.",

        "I speak to you this day with an utmost earnestness and sincerity.",

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive/Compulsive mix. The 'Depressive' side shows in his deep concern for the lost and the desire for harmony with God. The 'Compulsive' side appears in the emphasis on the 'final striking of the balance' and the necessity of correctness before time runs out.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is paternalistic and urgent. The preacher speaks as an elder/father figure ('Oh, hear me today!'). There is a 'We-definition' of a community under the same clock of eternity. However, there is 'relationship noise' in the intensity of the warning. By using the 'Peach tree switches' and 'Pops Swinton' examples, the preacher risks placing the hearer in the position of a frightened child. The relationship is 'from above' (the pulpit of experience) to 'below' (the drifting soul). While solidary in the 'we all must stand,' the tone is predominantly one of authoritative warning.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The appeal is the dominant side of this sermon. The 'Red Side' is a massive demand for immediate repentance ('Today is the day of salvation!'). Theologically, the ratio between Zuspruch (Promise) and Anspruch (Demand) is skewed toward the latter. While the preacher mentions 'still time to call his name,' the primary driver is the fear of 'spiritual desolation' and the 'peach tree switches' of judgment. The Gospel (Gift) is presented as a window that is rapidly closing, which turns the Promise into a time-sensitive Demand. This creates a high risk of moralism where faith is a work of 'hearing' before it's too late.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6,
    "summary": "This sermon is a powerful example of 'Kerygmatic Urgency.' Communicatively, it succeeds through vivid storytelling and a clear, singular focus on the 'Final Arbitration.' However, from a Barthian and Reformed perspective, it teeters on the edge of unhealthy psychologization by making the 'sensitivity of the human heart' the deciding factor in salvation rather than the objective 'Yes' of God in Christ. The 'Green' side (the preacher's earnestness) is the sermon's greatest strength, providing a bridge of authenticity to a difficult 'Blue' topic (Judgment). Yet, the 'Red' side (Appeal) creates a pressure that may lead to 'servility' rather than the 'freedom' of the Gospel. The 'Pops Swinton' narrative, while rhetorically brilliant, risks suggesting that God's grace is limited by human psychological states, a point Gerrit Immink would likely critique as over-emphasizing the human 'Erlebnis' over the Divine 'Subject.'",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon risks making the 'mercy of God' dependent on the 'spiritual sensitivity' of the hearer, effectively turning Grace into a human psychological capacity.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Masterful use of narrative to illustrate abstract doctrine.",
      "High level of personal authenticity and pastoral passion.",
      "Unapologetic confrontation with the biblical text's gravity."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Shift the focus from the 'closing window of mercy' to the 'open door of Christ'.",
      "Balance the paternalistic 'warning' with the 'solidarity of the redeemed'.",
      "Clarify the 'Book of Life' as the theological center to prevent pure moralism."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A rhetorically strong, traditional sermon that effectively uses psychological pressure to serve a 'Law-heavy' theological agenda. It achieves its goal of 'awakening' but lacks the 'Rest' of the Gospel."
