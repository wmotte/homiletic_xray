    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates high exegetical competence, particularly in connecting Psalm 110 with its New Testament reception (Matthew 22, Hebrews 7). The 'Sache' is the Christological identity of Jesus as both King and Priest. The factual side is clear: he explains the historical-legal impossibility of a King-Priest in Israel and the significance of the 'right hand' imagery. However, the analysis occasionally leans into intellectualism by spending significant time on the 'press conference' metaphor and the mechanics of the Melchizedek order. While the Christology is Barthian in its focus on the 'Living Christ', the factual density risks overwhelming the listener's capacity for existential reflection.",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as a 'Teaching Shepherd'. There is a conscious attempt at transparency ('I despair of getting it all in'), which signals a human struggle with the depth of the text. However, the self-revelation is highly controlled (image management). He positions himself as a mediator of truth rather than a fellow traveler in doubt. The 'I' is strictly diaconal, serving the text, but lacks the raw 'Selbstenthüllung' that Barth sometimes called for in the preacher's witness to their own need for grace. It is a professional, polished authenticity.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher-Student' or 'Doctor-Patient'. The preacher uses phrases like 'Let me show you' and 'I’m going to do a little metaphor on you', which establishes a hierarchy of knowledge. There is a 'Healing Disruption' when he explicitly states he wants to 'get into your face', which is a bold relational move. However, this is softened by the 'New Yorker' references, creating a 'we-definition' of shared urban skepticism. The tone is paternalistic but benevolent. The 'yellow' signal is: 'I have the diagnosis for your box-making tendencies.'",
      "quotes": [
        "I’d like to use Psalm 110 to get into your face.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The appeal is the strongest side, yet it is paradoxically 'soft' because it is rooted in the 'Zuspruch' (Promise). The preacher avoids moralism by insisting that the 'demand' (enlisting in the army) is a response to the 'beauty' of the King. The ratio of Law to Gospel is well-balanced: the Law 'gets in the face' to break the 'box', while the Gospel (the cross where justice and love meet) provides the motivation. The appeal is not 'do better', but 'see the beauty and be changed'. This is a high-level theological appeal that respects the Barthian priority of Grace.",

        "You have to surrender to me. You have to give up your right to live your life the way you want.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is a robust example of 'didactic homiletics'. It excels in the 'Blue' (Factual) and 'Red' (Appeal) dimensions by grounding the call to surrender in a deep exegetical study of Christ's offices. Theologically, it follows the Barthian/Edwardsian tradition of 'admirable conjunctions', presenting God not as a psychological object but as the Acting Subject of the Cross. The preacher successfully avoids moralism by making 'beauty' the engine of change. However, the 'Yellow' (Relational) side remains somewhat distant and clinical. The preacher's Riemann type (Compulsive/Schizoid) ensures a sermon that is structurally perfect and dogmatically sound, but perhaps lacks the 'Depressive' warmth or 'Hysterical' passion that might reach those who listen primarily with the 'Relationship Ear'. It is a highly effective 'teaching' sermon that respects the listener's intellect while firmly challenging their autonomy.",
    "barthian_warning": "Low risk of psychologization. The focus remains on the 'Extra Nos' (outside of us) work of Christ on the cross.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological synthesis of Justice and Love.",
      "Effective use of 'Healing Disruption' to challenge modern autonomy.",
      "Clear, logical structure that aids retention."

    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Soften the 'clinical' relational cues ('I'm going to do a metaphor on you').",
      "Increase the 'Green' side's vulnerability to balance the 'Blue' side's authority.",
      "Shorten historical illustrations to maintain existential momentum."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, intellectually rigorous sermon that serves the 'Sache' of the Gospel with communicative integrity, though it prioritizes the head over the heart in its relational delivery."
