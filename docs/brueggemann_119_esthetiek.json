    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes a central metaphor of the 'neighborhood' to reframe the Great Commandment. While it avoids traditional flowery wedding imagery, it employs concrete, albeit somewhat stark, images of social reality. The 'supreme neighbor' is a strong conceptual image for a spouse. However, the imagery remains largely sociological rather than sensory. There is a lack of vivid 'painting' of biblical scenes; the biblical world is treated more as a source of ethical mandates than a narrative landscape. The 'hand basket' and 'Mr. Rogers' references provide cultural color but lack poetic depth. The imagery serves the 'reframing' of marriage from a private bubble to a public office effectively but doesn't fully engage the senses.",

        "our society is going to hell in a hand basket",

    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and disciplined. The preacher practices 'stewardship of language' by carefully defining terms like 'complicated' vs. 'demanding' and 'complex' vs. 'difficult'. This distinction immediately signals a rejection of sloppy sentimentalism. The use of 'recent unpleasantness' as a euphemism for conflict is handled with rhetorical wit. There is a clear avoidance of 'Canaanite' jargon; even theological terms like 'Holy Neighbor' are integrated into the sermon's specific logic. The economy of words is high—every sentence serves the central thesis of de-romanticizing the union in favor of ethical neighborliness.",
      "quotes": [
        "Living a Christian life is not complicated, only demanding.",
        "The pledge taken is to treat this neighbor in order that the life of this neighbor may be more deeply joyous and more fully safe.",

        "Could benefit from more 'loving language' to balance the sharp ethical precision."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Religious jargon is almost non-existent. The preacher translates 'God' and 'Spouse' into the 'Neighbor' framework consistently."

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a strong, rhythmic cadence, particularly in the opening and the concluding summary. The use of parallelism ('There is the supreme neighbor... There is the neighbor in need... And there is the Holy Neighbor') creates a liturgical flow. The sentence structure is varied, moving from short, punchy assertions to longer, explanatory clauses. It is clearly 'oral language' designed for the ear, with a natural 'breath' to the phrasing. The repetition of 'neighbor' acts as a percussive beat throughout the text, though it risks becoming a 'hammer' rather than a 'melody'.",
      "quotes": [
        "They asked for only one and they got two...",
        "He answered well and they nodded in agreement. But he did not pause, not even for a comma...",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The micro-aesthetics are characterized by a 'sober-Reformed' beauty. The preacher eschews the typical aesthetic excess of wedding sermons in favor of linguistic precision and a singular, powerful metaphor. While the imagery is more conceptual than sensory, the stewardship of language is high. The rhythm is steady and authoritative, avoiding 'paper language' in favor of a direct, oral address. It is a text that values truth over beauty, yet finds a certain beauty in its stark honesty."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a logical rather than a narrative plot. It functions as an unfolding argument: from the definition of the commandment, to the expansion of the 'neighbor' (public marriage), to the reality of crisis (unpleasantness), and finally to the source of grace (Holy Neighbor). There is a clear 'upsetting of the equilibrium' in the rejection of 'romantic Utopia'. However, the movement is somewhat predictable. The 'turning point'—the move to God as the Holy Neighbor—is logical but lacks a dramatic 'event' quality. It feels more like a well-structured essay than a journey with a surprising destination.",
      "quotes": [
        "The great threat to marriage... is that one imagines one has only this one neighbor.",
        "And then it is time to notice that marriage is a quite public matter.",

        "Create more tension in the transition between the 'supreme neighbor' and the 'neighbor in need'.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. It performs a classic 'reframing' (Cilliers). It takes a familiar text (The Great Commandment) and a familiar context (a wedding) and forces them into a new relationship. By defining the spouse as the 'supreme neighbor', the preacher prevents the text from becoming a generic 'love' passage and prevents the wedding from becoming a 'private romantic' event. The integration of the 'therapeutic society' context is sharp and critical. It respects the 'strangeness' of the biblical demand while making it urgently relevant to the couple's public witness.",
      "quotes": [
        "The command pertains to marriage because in marriage one finds one’s supreme neighbor.",
        "Marriage is a quite public matter, which is why we do weddings in this public way.",

        "The connection to 'the poor and needy' could be more concretely tied to the specific couple's life.",
        "The 'War Between the States' reference is a bit of a detour, even if used as an analogy.",
        "More 'Space for Grace' could be found in the text's own historical strangeness."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing. It moves marriage from the frame of 'romance' to the frame of 'discipleship/neighborliness'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is relatively 'closed'. It functions as a prophetic teaching that leaves little room for the hearer's own interpretation. The preacher's voice is authoritative and the logic is airtight. While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (sickness, failure), it resolves these tensions quite quickly by pointing to the 'Holy Neighbor'. It approaches the hearer as a student of a new perspective rather than a participant in an 'open work of art'. The ending is a summary of the argument rather than an invitation into a mystery. It is monovalent: marriage *is* neighborliness.",
      "quotes": [
        "It should be clear to anyone who looks that our society is going to hell...",
        "Christian marriage is a process of finding that 'supreme neighbor'...",

        "Leave more 'unresolved' space for the couple to discover their own 'neighborhood'.",
        "Use more questions to invite the congregation into the interpretation.",
        "The conclusion could be more of a blessing/invitation than a final 'truth' statement."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Closed work of art. It is a declarative 'witness' (Long) that defines the reality for the hearer."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are driven by a strong, logical 'reframing' of the wedding event. The sermon moves with purpose from the private to the public and finally to the theological. While it lacks a traditional narrative plot, its 'dramaturgy of ideas' is compelling. However, the structure is quite closed; it functions as a definitive teaching rather than an open invitation. It succeeds in its goal of de-romanticizing marriage but does so through a rigid, albeit brilliant, conceptual framework."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is the antithesis of religious kitsch. It systematically dismantles the 'kitsch' of the modern wedding—the 'romantic Utopia' and the 'beautiful day in the neighborhood'. By introducing 'the stench' of the 'hell in a hand basket' and the 'recent unpleasantness' of medical diagnoses and financial failure, the preacher grounds the sermon in authentic, gritty reality. There are no pre-chewed emotions here; even the 'Holy Neighbor' is presented as a necessity for survival rather than a sentimental comfort. It is a 'sober' aesthetic that honors the pain of existence.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'romantic Utopia' (mentioned as a threat to be avoided).",
      "The 'Mr. Rogers' pretense of a 'beautiful day' (explicitly rejected)."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The list of 'unpleasantnesses' (sick child, financial failure, bad diagnosis).",
      "The admission that even the spouse will be 'less than helpful' in a crisis."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of honesty, but perhaps allow for a moment of 'authentic joy' that isn't just 'neighborly duty' to avoid becoming overly cynical."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened primarily in Section III, where the limits of human effort are acknowledged. By admitting that the 'supreme neighbor' will fail, the preacher creates a 'space' that only God (the Holy Neighbor) can fill. However, the sermon's heavy emphasis on 'demanding' life and 'difficult' marriage risks closing that space with moralism. Grace is presented as the 'fuel' for the 'task' of neighborliness rather than a transformative presence in itself. The 'mystery' of the union is largely explained away in favor of ethical categories.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'already' of the wedding and the 'not yet' of the 'unpleasantness' is well-sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "Low. The sermon prefers clarity and ethical definition over mystery.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Moralization prevails for much of the sermon, though it is 'saved' by the turn to the Holy Neighbor at the end.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'Holy Neighbor' to be more than a source of 'forgiveness and generosity' for the task; allow God to be the host of the 'neighborhood' whose presence is a gift before it is a demand."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of the 'Reframing' school of homiletics. It succeeds by being a 'counter-aesthetic' to the typical wedding sermon. Its beauty lies in its precision, its honesty, and its refusal to engage in kitsch. The language is disciplined and the structure is a rigorous unfolding of a single, powerful idea: marriage as a public office of neighborliness. While it lacks the 'openness' of an 'opera aperta' and the sensory 'imagery' of the New Homiletic, it possesses a 'sober beauty' that is deeply rooted in the Reformed tradition of the Word as a sharp, clarifying force. It is an 'event' of truth-telling that challenges the hearer's perception of reality.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Brilliant reframing of the spouse as the 'supreme neighbor'.",
      "Complete absence of religious and romantic kitsch.",
      "Exceptional stewardship of language and conceptual precision."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase sensory imagery to ground the ethical abstractions.",
      "Create more 'open space' for the hearer's own interpretation and mystery.",
      "Balance the ethical 'demand' with a more robust sense of 'gift' (grace)."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Prophetic-Reframing",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (for reframing and anti-kitsch) and Thomas Long (for the preacher as witness to a public truth).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to intellectually rigorous hearers, those skeptical of traditional wedding sentimentality, and those valued by 'post-liberal' theological circles.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'showing' a narrative scene from the biblical text to increase imagery.",
      "Use more 'open' endings to allow the 'Holy' to remain a mystery.",
      "Incorporate more 'musical' elements in the middle sections to maintain the rhythmic energy of the opening."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a high-quality aesthetic performance of 'ethical reframing'. It achieves its impact not through 'beautifying' the message, but through the 'beauty of simplicity' and the 'power of metaphor'. It is a courageous text that respects the hearer's intelligence and the gravity of the occasion. While it leans toward the 'closed' and 'moralistic' side of the spectrum, its absolute integrity and rejection of kitsch make it a compelling and aesthetically significant homiletical work."
