    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in 'painting the picture,' particularly in its use of global cultural imagery and the vivid personification of aging. It moves beyond abstract theology by grounding the 'rumor of life' in concrete artifacts: arrowheads, silver coins, and flint. The preacher employs sensory details—the 'stench' of death is implied through the 'tomb of ice' and 'grave of snow.' The use of Ecclesiastes 12 is a masterclass in imagery, translating the 'keepers of the house' into trembling arms and 'windows' into dimming eyes. This is 'showing, not telling' at its finest, allowing the hearer to visualize the decay of the body before offering the hope of the resurrection.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Egyptians... placed in the coffins of their dead that which they called 'the chest of the living,' the book of the dead.",
        "The eye, that window from which the soul and brain sit peering out upon the world, grows dim with years.",
        "The tiny insect leaping from blade to blade scarcely bends the grass beneath its weight."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Exceptional use of cultural-historical vignettes to illustrate a universal human instinct.",
        "Vivid allegorical interpretation of Ecclesiastes 12 that makes biological aging palpable.",
        "Strong nature metaphors (thawing earth, brave sprouts) that provide a seasonal rhythm to the argument."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The imagery of the 'rumor' itself could be more sensory—what does a rumor sound like in a crowded street or a quiet room?",
        "The transition to the 'atomic bomb' imagery is jarring and could be more visually integrated into the 'rumor' motif.",
        "Some metaphors, like 'pie in the sky,' are clichés that slightly dampen the poetic quality of the surrounding text."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strongly weighted toward 'showing.' The preacher describes the 'silver coin' and the 'flint and tinder' rather than just stating 'people believed in an afterlife.'"
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is dignified and precise, avoiding modern slang in favor of a 'sober beauty.' There is a clear stewardship of words, particularly in the rhythmic repetition of 'the rumor of life.' The preacher avoids heavy systematic-theological jargon (like 'soteriology' or 'eschatological verification') in favor of evocative descriptions. However, some phrases like 'precious notion' or 'blessed hope' border on the 'Canaanite' dialect of the church. The precision is highest when describing the physical reality of death and the historical practices of ancient peoples, creating a bridge between the secular and the sacred.",
      "quotes": [
        "The notion of life beyond life is so universal that we might say it is instinctual, like breathing or knee jerk.",
        "The sea of mystery which washes the shores of time and laps against the coasts of disillusionment.",
        "The onset of blindness had dimmed his vision, and his body moved slowly and laboriously."

        "Careful avoidance of dry academic terminology in favor of accessible, yet elevated, prose.",
        "Nuanced description of the 'journey' from cradle to grave as an incessant movement.",
        "Precise naming of human frailty, which prevents the sermon from becoming a superficial 'happy' Easter message."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Reduce the use of 'wistful hope' and 'precious notion' to avoid a sentimental tone.",
        "The quote from William A. Jones is somewhat clunky compared to the preacher's own poetic flow.",
        "Ensure the 'smart souls' and 'scorners' are not straw men, but addressed with more intellectual precision."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Religious jargon is minimal; the preacher uses 'resurrection' and 'grace' as operative realities rather than technical terms."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a distinct oral cadence, characteristic of the great tradition of pulpit eloquence. There is a sophisticated use of parallelism and repetition ('they crucified him, but he is risen... they put him in the grave, but he is risen'). The sentence structure varies effectively between long, flowing descriptions of history and staccato, punchy declarations of faith. The rhythm mimics the 'ticking of the clock' mentioned in the text. It is clearly a text written for the ear, with a natural 'flow' that builds toward a rhetorical crescendo in the final section.",
      "quotes": [
        "Moving night and day, like the hands that circle round the hours, the heart beating on like the ticking of the clock.",
        "The trembling earth, the silent skies, the darkened heavens, the blessed prayer.",
        "They said it was all over, but 'he is risen.' The disciples could not believe it until they looked up."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Masterful use of anaphora (repetition at the beginning of sentences) to build emotional weight.",
        "The rhythm of the Ecclesiastes section creates a somber, funeral-march-like cadence that makes the Easter turn more dramatic.",
        "Excellent variation in sentence length, preventing monotony."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The list of ancient cultures (Indians, Greeks, Egyptians, etc.) is slightly long and risks losing the rhythmic momentum.",
        "The transition to the personal anecdote about Marshall Shepard could be smoother in its rhythmic entry.",
        "Some sentences in the middle section are a bit 'wordy' and could be tightened for better oral impact."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Strongly oral language. The text breathes and pulses with a rhythm that suggests a performance-oriented delivery."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The sermon displays a high level of micro-aesthetic quality. It avoids the 'paper language' of the academy, opting instead for a rich, imagistic, and rhythmic style. The preacher acts as a 'steward of the word,' using sensory details to make the abstract concept of resurrection tangible. The imagery of the 'rumor' provides a cohesive thread, while the rhythmic repetition ensures the message is memorable. It is a 'sober beauty' that respects the weight of death while celebrating the light of life."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot.' It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium'—the rumor that seems like an idle tale. It then moves into a deep exploration of the 'trouble' (the universal reality of death and aging). The tension peaks during the description of the 'grasshopper becoming a burden' and the silence of Holy Saturday. The turning point is the 'Sunday morning' transition, where the rumor becomes actuality. The movement is not a static three-point lecture but a journey from the 'cemeteries of the world' to the 'empty grave of Christ.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The rumor which seemed like an idle tale was the word of life.",
        "Is there anything to the rumor that life is mightier than death?",
        "Friday at last became Sunday morning, and the old rumor took on new life."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong movement from the universal (human culture) to the particular (biblical text).",
        "The 'delay' in reaching the Easter message allows the weight of death to be fully felt, making the resolution more powerful.",
        "Effective use of the 'rumor' motif as a narrative thread that ties the whole structure together."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The section on justice and the atomic bomb feels like a thematic detour that briefly breaks the narrative arc.",
        "The conclusion is a bit abrupt; it confirms the rumor but could spend more time on the 'now what?' for the hearer.",
        "The transition between the ancient burial customs and the nature metaphors is slightly disjointed."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey that moves from universal human longing to the specific Christian event."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong example of Cilliers' 'reframing.' The preacher takes the contemporary experience of aging and the historical reality of death and reframes them through the lens of the 'rumor of life.' The integration of Ecclesiastes 12 with the personal story of Marshall Shepard is a brilliant synthesis of ancient text and modern context. It honors the 'strangeness' of the biblical imagery while making it immediately relevant to anyone who has felt the 'frost of age.' The sermon does not just repeat the Bible; it allows the Bible to read our lives.",
      "quotes": [
        "The author tells us we had best remember our Creator in the days of youth when evil days come not.",
        "Partner, I have come to the place where the grasshopper is a burden.",
        "Somewhere the things that are wrong in this life must be made right, or there is no justice in the universe."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The personal anecdote serves as a perfect bridge between the poetic text of Ecclesiastes and the reality of the hearer.",
        "The sermon successfully connects the 'idle tale' of the women with the 'instinctual' beliefs of global cultures.",
        "Reframes the fear of death as a 'journey' that is shared by all, reducing isolation."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection to the 'atomic bomb' and 'slums' is important but could be more organically tied to the 'rumor' metaphor.",
        "The transition from the 'Old Testament rumors' to the 'New Testament actuality' is a bit traditional and could be more creatively reframed.",
        "More focus on how the 'risen Lord's presence' is felt in the *current* context of the congregation would strengthen the end."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes, it reframes the 'inevitability of death' as a 'prelude to the rumor of life.'"
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is aesthetically rich, it leans toward a 'closed' structure in its theological conclusion. The 'rumor' is 'confirmed,' and the tension is resolved. However, it avoids being 'sealed shut' by acknowledging the 'sea of mystery' and the 'melancholy elegy' of existence. It treats the hearer as a mature partner by acknowledging their 'stake' in the journey. The 'openness' comes from the lingering imagery of the 'grasshopper' and the 'dark journey,' which remain in the hearer's mind even after the 'happy ending' of Easter is proclaimed.",
      "quotes": [
        "This unknown seer in Israel... beheld the sea of mystery which washes the shores of time.",
        "Is there anything to the rumor that life is mightier than death?",
        "We need this hope as the frost of age falls on our heads."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the 'wistful hope' and 'melancholy' of life, leaving room for the hearer's own sadness.",
        "The use of 'rumor' suggests a degree of mystery that isn't entirely erased by the word 'confirmed.'",
        "Invites the hearer into the journey rather than just lecturing them on the destination."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The ending is very declarative ('Christ is Lord indeed'), which is liturgically appropriate but aesthetically 'closes' the work of art.",
        "Could leave more room for the 'disciples' doubt' to mirror the hearer's own potential skepticism.",
        "The resolution of the 'injustice' problem is a bit too 'neat' (there *must* be a by and by)."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily a 'closed' work of art that uses 'open' imagery to sustain interest."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is strong, characterized by a clear narrative movement and excellent integration of text and life. The preacher avoids a static 'three-point' structure, opting instead for a 'homiletical plot' that respects the tension between Friday and Sunday. The use of the 'rumor' motif provides a sophisticated structural unity. While the conclusion is dogmatically firm, the journey through the 'valley of the shadow' (Ecclesiastes) ensures the sermon remains grounded in the human condition."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids religious kitsch. It does not offer 'immediate comfort' without first taking the 'pain of suffering' seriously. By spending significant time on the 'shriveled limbs' and 'darkened windows' of old age, the preacher earns the right to speak of hope. The emotion feels authentic because it is rooted in the physical reality of decay and the personal loss of a friend. It avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by framing the resurrection as a 'rumor' that must be 'confirmed' through a difficult journey of faith.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The phrase 'pie in the sky by and by' is a cliché, though the preacher uses it to critique a cynical view.",
      "The 'first brave sprouts' of spring is a slightly hackneyed nature metaphor for resurrection."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of Marshall Shepard's infirmity and his sad admission about the grasshopper.",
      "The acknowledgement of the 'atomic bomb' and 'slums' as places where justice is missing."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To further increase depth, avoid the 'nature repeats the rumor' trope, as it can feel like a sentimental 'happy ending' that bypasses the radicality of the cross."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by acknowledging the 'sea of mystery' and the 'wistful hope' of humanity. The preacher does not 'seal' the sermon with a list of moral duties ('we must do X to be saved'). Instead, the focus is on the 'risen Lord and his living presence' as a gift. However, the space is slightly narrowed by the insistence that there 'must' be a heaven for justice to exist, which borders on a logical requirement rather than a surprising grace. Overall, the 'Space for Grace' is found in the 'between'—between the cemetery and the empty grave.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained through the long middle section on aging, only being resolved in the final third.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'sea of mystery' is explicitly mentioned, though the ending seeks to provide a firm 'confirmation.'",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. There is very little moralization; the focus is on the 'grandest news' being a reality to be received.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'silence of the skies' on Friday to linger a bit longer to emphasize that grace is an interruption, not a logical necessity."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.3,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust piece of homiletic art that successfully navigates the 'aesthetic turn.' It avoids the dry, vertical revelation of dialectical theology by grounding the Word in the sensory, human experience of aging and cultural history. The 'Poetics of Language' are strong, particularly in the rhythmic and imagistic treatment of Ecclesiastes 12. The 'Dramaturgy of Structure' follows a compelling narrative arc that respects the weight of death before proclaiming the 'rumor of life.' It avoids the pitfall of religious kitsch by refusing to offer cheap comfort, instead anchoring its hope in the 'laborious' reality of human infirmity. While the conclusion is dogmatically traditional, the path taken to get there is one of 'sober beauty' and 'reframing.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Vivid, sensory imagery that translates ancient metaphors into physical realities.",
      "Strong oral rhythm and cadence that builds rhetorical power.",
      "Authentic integration of personal anecdote and universal human experience."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduce reliance on clichéd phrases like 'pie in the sky' or 'blessed hope.'",
      "Tighten the thematic integration of the 'justice/atomic bomb' section.",
      "Experiment with a more 'open' ending that leaves the hearer in the 'rumor's' mystery."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Poetic-Imagistic with a Narrative-Dramatic structure.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson and the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to hearers who value literary depth, emotional authenticity, and a connection between faith and the physical realities of life.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Incorporate more 'silence' or 'negative space' in the text to mirror the 'silent skies' of Friday.",
      "Use more 'living metaphors' for the Holy Spirit's role in 'confirming' the rumor.",
      "Read the text aloud during drafting to further refine the 'musicality' of the longer historical lists."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon 'Rumor of Life' is a high-quality example of aesthetic preaching. It succeeds because it does not treat the resurrection as a dry fact, but as a 'rumor' that interacts with the deepest fears and longings of the human heart. By using the body (aging) as a canvas, the preacher makes the 'Word' sensory. It is a sermon that 'shows' the need for grace before 'telling' the gospel, thereby creating a genuine 'Space for Grace.' It stands as a strong model of how Reformed sobriety can be wedded to poetic power."
