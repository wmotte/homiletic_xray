    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's primary requirement of being an 'exposition of a specific Bible passage.' It functions as a thematic speech on the name of Jesus, jumping between John, Matthew, Hebrews, and various Old Testament titles. It does not seek what is unique to one text, but rather what is general to a 'biblical idea.'",
      "quotes": [
        "A speech about 'the gospel', 'the power of God'... is not a sermon",

      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one pericope (e.g., John 1:14-18) and isolate what this text specifically says about the Word becoming flesh that is found nowhere else, rather than providing a catalog of Christological titles."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "There is no formal exegesis of the Greek text or the specific Johannine context. The preacher mentions 'the writer of the Gospel of John' but uses the text merely as a springboard for dogmatic assertions. The historical reference to Pergamos is illustrative but not exegetical regarding the chosen text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Our writer of the Gospel of John, having saluted the majesty of the law... turns to another"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Analyze the specific tension in John 1:17 between 'nomos' and 'charis' within the Johannine community's context to ground the sermon in historical-theological reality."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Application is present but tends toward the general. While it mentions 'projects and enterprises' of the local congregation, it lacks the 'sharpness' Dekker requires. It remains largely in the realm of 'faith development' and 'personal strength' without addressing the zeitgeist or specific cultural philosophy.",

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Because there is little formal exposition, there is little to interweave. The sermon is a series of 'proclamatory bursts.' The hearer is not 'drawn into the text' to be expounded by it; rather, the text is used to decorate the preacher's existing Christological framework.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now I would want to fasten this morning upon those two titles joined together: Jesus Christ."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon is strong on redemption and touches on gratitude (the 'projects'). However, 'misery' is treated lightly—mostly as 'infirmities' or 'temptation' rather than the radical misery of man before God. It leans toward a 'Christocentric' objectivity that Dekker warns against if it ignores the human subject's plight.",

      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "This is almost entirely absent. There is no sense of the 'broad way' or the possibility of being 'lost in time or eternity.' The tone is one of universal celebration. The 'seriousness of life design' is missing; life feels more like a 'vacation' than a 'journey with a purpose' in this text.",
      "quotes": [
        "That name, Jesus Christ, can still save and bless each of us."

      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the 'seriousness of the destination.' If Christ is the way, what is the consequence of the alternative? The hearer must be confronted with a choice."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "This is the sermon's strongest point. It explicitly upholds the two-natures doctrine and makes Christ the absolute telos. It avoids making Christ a mere example and insists on His divinity as the source of salvation.",
      "quotes": [
        "He is a man, and he is God. I cannot explain it, but my soul, my life resonates and exults upon that faith."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 14-15 minutes (1450 words), the sermon fails Dekker's 20-minute minimum. According to Miskotte/Dekker, it lacks the 'breadth' required for true 'depth.' It feels more like a homily or a devotional speech than a full sermon.",
      "quotes": [
        "A sermon that lasts less than 20 minutes cannot be a sermon."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical and contemporary analysis to reach the 20-minute threshold, allowing the 'specific word' of the text to breathe."

  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text falls short of being a 'sermon' according to Dekker's formal definition. It is a thematic speech on a 'biblical keyword' (Jesus Christ) rather than an exposition of a specific pericope. It lacks the required length (under 20 minutes) and entirely avoids the 'two ways' (judgment/lostness). However, it is theologically robust in its adherence to the two-natures of Christ and avoids the trap of liberal moralism.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Trinitarian and Chalcedonian foundation (Thesis 7).",
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' (misery, redemption, gratitude) as a background framework, even if misery is under-emphasized.",
      "Clear rejection of 'pious fantasy' in favor of an 'earthy faith'."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Failure to ground the message in a single, specific Bible passage (Thesis 1.3).",
      "Insufficient duration to achieve the 'breadth' necessary for 'depth' (Thesis 8).",
      "Total absence of the 'two ways' or the urgency of being lost (Thesis 6)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate theological speech, but it is not a sermon. It lacks the specificity of a single text and the formal breadth required for the ministry of the Word. It functions as a 'general truth' about Christ rather than a 'current, proclamatory word' born from one specific Scripture."
