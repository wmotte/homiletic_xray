    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon employs strong, visceral imagery to bridge the gap between the biblical narrative and contemporary reality. The preacher utilizes the metaphor of the 'Trojan horse' to describe the liturgical structure, which effectively visualizes the 'trap' of grace. Sensory details are particularly sharp in the description of the Algerian man—the 'bloodstains' and the 'silent tears dropping on the table'—which grounds the abstract concept of divine solidarity in a cinematic, heartbreaking scene. However, some metaphors remain somewhat conventional ('storehouse of love', 'load you are carrying'), preventing a higher score. The imagery successfully avoids 'telling' the hearer that Jesus is sad, instead 'showing' the weight of his tears through the lens of human tragedy.",

        "Palm Sunday is the Trojan horse of the Christian year.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is marked by a high degree of stewardship and precision. The preacher avoids 'Canaanite' jargon, instead opting for clear, robust English that does justice to the gravity of the subject. There is a careful distinction made between 'sentiment' and 'authentic emotion,' which is central to the sermon's aesthetic integrity. The use of the sign 'We make Easter easy!' serves as a precise linguistic foil to the 'word of the Cross.' The vocabulary is sophisticated yet accessible, showing a deep respect for the weight of words like 'visitation,' 'complicity,' and 'inconsolable.' The precision in describing the woman at the church door demonstrates an ability to use narrative to expose theological misunderstanding without being unkind.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a rhythmic cadence that supports its oral delivery. There is a deliberate use of parallelism and repetition ('Did anyone ever weep for you? Did your mother... Did your father...'), which builds emotional momentum. The sentence length varies effectively, moving from short, punchy observations to longer, more reflective passages. The 'Trojan horse' section has a natural flow that mimics the 'luring in' it describes. While not overtly poetic in a rhyming sense, the prose has a 'sober beauty' characteristic of the best Reformed-Anglican traditions. The ending, however, falls into a slightly more predictable liturgical rhythm that lacks the sharp rhythmic surprises of the middle section.",

        "Tears are eloquent. Tears speak.",
        "Did anyone ever weep for you? Did your mother shed tears... Did your father weep...?",

    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high level of linguistic stewardship. It avoids the 'kitsch' of easy religious language by grounding its claims in concrete, often painful, imagery. The 'show, don't tell' principle is applied masterfully in the central illustration of the Algerian man, which serves as a powerful aesthetic anchor. The rhythm is generally strong, utilizing rhetorical repetition to involve the hearer emotionally. While the conclusion leans on more traditional liturgical tropes, the overall poetics are precise, sober, and transparent toward the 'mystery' of the Passion."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a sophisticated 'Homiletical Plot.' It begins by upsetting the equilibrium with the 'strangeness' of Palm Sunday and the confusion of the acolyte. This introduces a tension: the conflict between the 'easy Easter' of the culture and the 'hard Passion' of the Gospel. The movement is not a static three-point list but a journey deeper into the 'heart of these events.' The turning point is the transition from Jesus weeping *for* the city to Jesus weeping *as* God's solidarity with us. The energy is sustained through the use of the 60 Minutes story, which raises the stakes of the 'tears' before moving toward the resolution of the Cross. It is a dynamic journey from the 'Trojan horse' of festivity to the 'peace' found in the agony of the Cross.",
      "quotes": [

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a prime example of Cilliers' 'reframing.' The preacher takes the ancient text of Jesus weeping over Jerusalem and reframes it through the lens of modern tragedies (Jonesboro, Algeria, commercialism). The synthesis is organic; the 'strangeness' of the biblical text is not smoothed over but used to expose the superficiality of contemporary 'spirituality.' The connection between the 'city' of Jerusalem and the 'city' of the modern hearer is made through the shared human experience of sin and sorrow. The sermon does not just apply the text; it allows the text to 'read' the context, particularly in the critique of 'making Easter easy.' The integration is surprising yet feels inevitable, which is a hallmark of strong homiletic aesthetics.",
      "quotes": [
        "We execute serial killers and terrorist bombers... Jesus does not weep for himself. He weeps for the city.",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is aesthetically rich, it leans toward a 'closed' structure in its theological conclusions. The preacher is a 'witness' (in Long's sense) who clearly defines the meaning of the Cross. While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence' and 'mystery' of the day, the final application is quite directive ('Bring it to him. He has borne it already'). The sermon is polyvalent in its imagery (the tears), but monovalent in its dogmatic thrust (the necessity of the Cross). It doesn't leave the hearer with a question so much as an invitation to a specific path. However, the acknowledgment of the woman who 'couldn't say Crucify him' provides a space for the hearer's own resistance to be seen and addressed.",
      "quotes": [
        "I've always been curious about the reaction of unsuspecting churchgoers...",
        "She obviously expected me to congratulate her. Unfortunately, she had missed the whole point.",

        "Avoid the 'I have faith in you' concluding rhetoric, which feels slightly moralistic.",
        "Allow the 'mystery' of the tears to remain a bit more unavailable rather than fully explained."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily a 'closed' work of art that uses 'open' imagery to lead to a specific theological conclusion."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is the sermon's greatest strength. It functions as a 'Trojan horse,' luring the hearer in with the familiar festivity of Palm Sunday before confronting them with the visceral reality of the Passion. The narrative arc is well-constructed, moving from external observation to deep internal and cultural critique. The integration of text and context is masterful, providing a 'reframing' of human sorrow through the tears of Christ. While the conclusion is somewhat dogmatically 'closed,' the journey there is aesthetically compelling and sustains the tensions of Holy Week."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a powerful polemic against religious kitsch. The preacher explicitly identifies and rejects 'easy Easter'—the commercialized, sentimentalized version of faith that avoids the Cross. By contrasting 'sentimental tears' with the 'tears wrung out of God's inmost heart,' the sermon maintains authentic aesthetic depth. It refuses to offer 'immediate comfort' without first taking the 'pain of suffering' and the 'reality of sin' seriously. The use of the Algerian massacre is the antithesis of kitsch; it is raw, unresolved, and tragic. The sermon sustains the 'trouble' (in Wilson's terms) long enough for the 'grace' to feel earned rather than cheap.",

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon creates a profound 'Space for Grace' by first creating a space for lament and truth-telling. By refusing to 'make Easter easy,' the preacher opens up the 'between' space (Cilliers' inter-esse) where the hearer's real burdens can meet Christ's real suffering. The 'visitation' is presented not as a demand, but as an event of divine solidarity. While the ending is slightly moralistic, the core of the sermon suggests that grace is found precisely where we are 'dashed to the ground.' It respects the mystery of why God weeps, even as it proclaims the certainty of God's love.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'celebrity' welcome and the 'serial killer' execution is sustained effectively.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'eloquence' of silent tears respects the mystery of suffering more than any explanation could.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails, though it is a 'costly grace' that demands a confrontation with sin.",
    "recommendation": "To increase space, allow the 'silence' of the tears to occupy more of the sermon's conclusion, rather than filling it with 'what we must do'."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.7,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of modern homiletics that successfully navigates the 'aesthetic turn.' It rejects the superficiality of 'religious kitsch' in favor of a 'sober beauty' that is both intellectually sharp and emotionally resonant. The preacher functions as a 'witness' to the Passion, using cinematic imagery and a well-constructed narrative arc to lead the hearer from the 'Trojan horse' of Palm Sunday festivity to the foot of the Cross. The strength of the sermon lies in its 'reframing'—the ability to see the tears of a 1st-century Messiah in the silent weeping of a modern Algerian man. The language is precise and carefully stewarded, avoiding jargon while maintaining theological depth. While the conclusion is slightly more conventional and 'closed' than the rest of the piece, the overall effect is one of 'authentic aesthetic depth.' It creates a 'space for grace' by refusing to look away from the 'trouble' of sin and the 'agony' of the Cross. It is a sermon that 'shows' more than it 'tells,' inviting the hearer into a visceral encounter with the 'time of their visitation.'",

      "Incorporate more tactile or olfactory imagery to deepen the 'visceral' quality mentioned.",
      "Try to integrate the cultural 'Postscript' (like the David Brooks analysis) into the body of the sermon as a 'reframing' device."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically superior work that honors the 'aesthetic turn' by making the form (the Trojan horse/the tears) inseparable from the content (the Cross/Grace). It avoids the pitfalls of sentimentality and provides a model for how to handle 'hard' liturgical seasons with poetic and dramaturgical integrity. It is a '7.7'—a strong, excellent sermon that stops just short of being a 'model' due to its slightly conventional conclusion."
