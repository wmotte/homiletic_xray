  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher addresses the 'Sache' of John 14:12 with exegetical seriousness, focusing on the 'greater works' promise. The theological core is the transition from the localized, humiliated Christ to the universal, glorified Christ. The preacher correctly identifies the 'because' clause (Ascension) as the hermeneutical key. However, the 'blue' side remains somewhat narrow; it relies heavily on a historical-linear interpretation of progress (hospitals, missions) rather than exploring the ontological depth of the 'unio mystica' or the specific nature of the 'works' as signs of the Kingdom. The distinction between riddle and puzzle serves as a pedagogical hook but adds little to the dogmatic substance.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is no promise dangling out in 'midair'...",
        "Jesus submitted to limitations in being in the flesh.",
        "He who was universal localized himself."

        "Address the tension between the 'greater works' and the persistence of evil more rigorously."

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The use of the 'riddle' metaphor makes the abstract concept of Christology accessible."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a high degree of homiletical honesty. By admitting he 'never dared to use' this text for fifty years, he displays a 'diaconal' vulnerability that serves the text's authority rather than his own ego. There is a sense of 'Selbstenthüllung' regarding his long-term struggle with the biblical word. He presents himself as a servant who is also a student of the Word. The green side is used strategically to build trust: if a veteran of 50 years found this difficult, the congregation is allowed to find it difficult too. The revelation is controlled but feels authentic.",
      "quotes": [
        "I first attempted to preach during the summer of 1937.",
        "There is one passage which I have never dared to use as a text.",
        "I, for one, have always fallen back from these words."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive (Zwanghaft) with a Depressive (Harmony-seeking) secondary trait. The preacher values correctness, long-term consistency (50 years of 'unceasing' attempt), and the 'integrity' of the Lord. He seeks to resolve the 'riddle' to restore order and harmony in his faith system.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is subservient; it is used as a bridge to the text's difficulty.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching' and 'Paternalistic'. The preacher positions himself as the 'wise man' or the elder statesman of faith. While he uses 'we' and 'us', the direction of communication is clearly from the pulpit down to the 'simplest mind'. There is a warmth (Depressive trait), but it is the warmth of a grandfatherly figure rather than a fellow traveler in the trenches. The 'yellow' signals are stable and safe, which may comfort some but might feel slightly distant or 'above' to a younger or more skeptical audience.",
      "quotes": [
        "The simplest mind can understand what it says.",
        "You will sympathize with anyone who finds them all too vast...",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily an invitation to 'Trust' (Zuspruch) rather than a 'Demand' (Anspruch). The 'Red' side is surprisingly soft given the 'greater works' theme. The preacher does not command the congregation to go out and do miracles; instead, he appeals to them to recognize the current power of the Risen Christ. The 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is the centerpiece: Christ is at the right hand of God. However, the appeal to 'ask in his name' at the end is somewhat underdeveloped—it lands as a pious suggestion rather than a transformative call to participate in the 'greater works'.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have but to ask him, to call him...",
        "Greater works yet shall Christ's people do.",

      ],

    "disruptions": "A minor disruption occurs between the 'greater works' promise and the 'depressive' tone of the preacher, which is more comforting than 'fiery'.",
    "healing_disruption": "The 'Healing Disruption' is the challenge to the listener's small view of Christ. It disrupts the 'localized' Jesus to force a confrontation with the 'Universal' Lord."

    "the_appeal_ear_hears": "I should pray more because Jesus is at the right hand of God and can actually do something.",
    "the_self_revelation_ear_hears": "This man has spent 50 years obsessing over the Bible; he is disciplined and deeply devoted to the 'integrity' of Jesus."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a solid, traditional sermon that successfully bridges the gap between a difficult biblical text and a comforting dogmatic conclusion. The preacher uses his own history (Green) to validate the difficulty of the text (Blue), eventually resolving the tension through an Ascension-centered Christology. While the sermon is communicatively clear and theologically sound (Barthian 'Sache' is present), it lacks the 'razor-sharp' contemporary application that would move it into the higher scoring brackets. It is a 'safe' sermon that prioritizes the 'Zuspruch' of the Gospel over the 'Anspruch' of the mission. The psychological profile is one of stability and correctness (Compulsive), which provides a firm foundation for the congregation but may lack the 'Hysterical' energy required to truly mobilize for 'greater works'.",
    "barthian_warning": "The preacher avoids unhealthy psychologization by keeping the focus on the 'Acting Subject' (Christ at the right hand) rather than the 'experience' of the believer.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Homiletical honesty/vulnerability.",
      "Clear Christological focus.",
      "Strong use of the Ascension as a theological pivot."

    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Increase the intensity of the 'Appeal'.",
      "Modernize the 'Relational' signals to be less paternalistic.",
      "Deepen the social/ethical implications of 'greater works'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively integral and theologically responsible sermon that fulfills its purpose with dignity, though it remains within the comfort zone of traditional homiletics."
