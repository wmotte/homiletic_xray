    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon relies heavily on abstract theological concepts and 'telling' rather than 'showing'. While it references the 'Lamb of God', it treats the image more as a dogmatic label than a sensory reality. The most vivid moment is the description of a painting of John the Baptist, which provides a much-needed visual anchor. However, beyond this, the language remains largely conceptual. The preacher mentions 'the stench of the pigsty' would have been a Wilson-esque improvement, but here we only get 'the power of sin'. The attempt to use a contemporary news story (the scandal) provides a concrete narrative, but it is used more as an illustrative warning than a poetic image. The biblical world is not 'painted' but explained.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is clear and accessible, avoiding overly dense academic jargon, which aligns with McEntyre's call for clarity. However, it falls into 'Canaanite' linguistic patterns—phrases like 'vrijmoedigheid', 'volkomen verzoening', and 'navolgen' are used as shorthand without fresh precision. There is a tendency toward repetitive filler phrases ('dat is dus wat...', 'ik zeg het maar even zo'). The precision is highest when discussing the nuance of 'sin' in the singular versus plural, showing a theological care for words. Yet, the stewardship of language is hindered by a somewhat conversational, loose style that lacks the 'sober beauty' of carefully crafted Reformed prose.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jezus is niet alleen een middeltje om niet in de hel te komen. Ik zeg, het is misschien een beetje plat gezegd...",
        "Of is het je vermeende orthodoxie die je in de weg staat...",

      "jargon_analysis": "Moderate use of religious jargon ('verzoening', 'Messias'). While explained, they function as 'closed' theological blocks."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon has an oral quality, but it is the rhythm of a lecture rather than a poetic event. The sentence structures are often long and additive, lacking the staccato/legato variation that creates rhetorical 'flow'. There is little use of alliteration or intentional parallelism to make the message memorable. The rhythm is somewhat monotonous because many paragraphs follow the same pattern: a biblical observation followed by a 'how about us?' question. It lacks the 'musicality' that Grözinger associates with the aesthetic power of the Word. It reads like a transcript of a spoken talk rather than a composed homiletic performance.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jezus nodigt ons uit. En die uitnodiging die komen we ook tegen in Johannes 1...",

    },
    "average_score_language": 5.33,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are functional but lack aesthetic 'shine'. The imagery is largely confined to one painting, and the language, while clear, relies on traditional Reformed idioms that have lost some of their evocative power. It prioritizes clarity of teaching over the sensory or musical experience of the Word. According to Grözinger's standard, the 'form' here is a didactic vessel rather than an integral part of the revelation itself."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear, logical progression, moving from the biblical narrative to contemporary application. It utilizes a 'Lowry-esque' move by introducing 'hindernisses' (obstacles) early on, which creates a sense of 'trouble' or tension. However, the 'turning point'—the move to the Lamb of God—is more of a theological explanation than a dramatic shift. The movement feels more like a guided tour through the text than a 'happening' or 'event' (Immink). The energy peaks during the discussion of the scandal and the painting but plateaus during the application about 'kringen' (small groups), which feels slightly anticlimactic.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wat verhindert ons? Welke hindernissen werpen wij zelf op? Dat is een belangrijke vraag.",
        "Maar terwijl ze zo naar Jezus toegaan... draait Jezus zich om en Hij zegt: 'Wat zoekt u?'",

      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of the question 'Wat zoekt u?' as a pivot point in the sermon.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong point. The preacher successfully 'reframes' (Cilliers) the biblical call to discipleship within modern psychological and social realities, such as the 'fear of missing out' or the difficulty of making definitive choices in a liquid modern world. The integration of the news story about the Christian leader is a bold attempt to connect the 'Lamb that takes away sin' with real-world messiness. While the transition is a bit blunt, it respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the Lamb) while making it relevant to the 'now'. It avoids the pitfall of keeping the Bible in a vacuum.",
      "quotes": [
        "Het is wel een verschijnsel van deze tijd ook... dat ze het moeilijk vinden om zich ergens op vast te pinnen.",
        "Afgelopen week las ik in de kranten... over een christelijke leider dat hij acht jaar lang een relatie heeft gehad...",

      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent connection between the 'Rabbi' concept and modern 'mentorship' or 'commitment' issues.",
        "The 'reframing' of evangelism as 'sharing something beautiful' (like a social media post) is culturally astute.",

      "reframing_present": "Yes, it offers a new frame for 'invitation'—not as a burden, but as a discovery to be shared."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward a 'closed' work of art. While it asks many questions, the preacher quickly provides the 'correct' answers. The ending is somewhat moralistic, focusing on the 'must' of attending small groups and the 'how-to' of evangelism. There is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' (Stark) or the 'mystery of God' (Cilliers). The hearer is guided through a fairly narrow interpretive path. The 'Space for Grace' is somewhat constricted by the didactic urge to ensure the congregation knows exactly what to do next. It functions more as an 'instruction manual' than an 'opera aperta'.",
      "quotes": [
        "En om dat onderwijs te ontvangen, moeten we natuurlijk wel heel dicht bij Jezus zijn.",
        "Ik mag het wel even benadrukken. Ook in het focustraject. Hoe belangrijk het is om naar de kringen te gaan.",

        "Avoid 'liturgical commercials' (e.g., mentioning the 'focustraject') within the aesthetic flow of the sermon.",
        "Trust the Holy Spirit to apply the Word rather than over-explaining the 'steps' of application."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Monovalent. The meaning is clearly defined and directed toward specific congregational behaviors."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is solid and logical, excelling in connecting the ancient text to modern commitment issues. However, it suffers from a 'closed' ending that prioritizes congregational programming over aesthetic openness. The narrative arc moves from 'trouble' to 'solution' effectively, but the solution is presented more as a set of instructions than a transformative encounter. It is a 'witness' (Long) that is perhaps a bit too eager to be a 'teacher'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids religious kitsch. It does not offer 'cheap comfort' or 'pre-chewed emotions'. By bringing up the scandal of the Christian leader and the 'commitment-phobia' of youth, the preacher acknowledges the 'pain of reality'. The 'happy ending' is not a superficial emotional high but a call to the discipline of 'staying' with Jesus. However, the language about 'sharing something beautiful' like a phone call risks sliding into a slightly sentimentalized view of evangelism. Overall, it maintains an authentic, sober tone characteristic of the Reformed tradition, avoiding the 'kitsch' of easy triumphalism.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The comparison of the Gospel to a 'beautiful thing you share on social media' (verges on trivializing the 'staurological' depth of the Lamb).",
      "The slightly repetitive 'Jezus nodigt ons uit' can become a clichéd mantra if not grounded in the 'trouble' of the text."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The honest naming of 'orthodox' barriers to faith.",
      "The refusal to condemn the fallen leader while taking the sin seriously.",
      "The admission that the disciples likely didn't understand the 'Lamb' theology right away."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To increase depth, lean further into the 'strangeness' of the Lamb metaphor. The 'blood in the cup' is a visceral image that counters kitsch; use more of that 'heavy' imagery to balance the 'light' invitation."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is opened by the clear proclamation of the 'Lamb of God' as a power beyond human effort. Cilliers' 'reframing' occurs when the preacher shifts the focus from 'my decision' to 'His invitation'. However, the space is partially closed by the moralizing turn toward the end (the 'must' of the kringen/small groups). The 'mystery' of the encounter is somewhat explained away by the didactic focus. There is a tension between the 'Space for Grace' (the vertical gift) and the 'Space for the Program' (the horizontal task).",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are introduced (sin, doubt) but resolved fairly quickly through theological explanation.",
    "mystery_respected": "Moderate. The 'Rabbi' and 'Lamb' are explained well, but the 'mystery' of staying with Jesus is turned into a schedule of Bible reading and prayer.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the middle section (the Lamb), but moralization takes over in the final application.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'staying with Jesus' to remain a bit more mysterious and 'unavailable'. Don't just give a 'to-do' list; describe the *beauty* of the presence of God so that the hearer *wants* to be there, rather than feels they *should* be there."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is a solid, 'Sober-Reformed' piece of homiletic work. Its greatest aesthetic strength lies in its 'reframing' of the biblical text for a modern audience struggling with commitment and authenticity. It avoids the trap of religious kitsch by dealing with real sin and real social contexts. However, it is aesthetically limited by its 'paper language' and its didactic, closed structure. The imagery, while anchored by a strong description of a painting, does not permeate the rest of the text, leaving much of the sermon in the realm of abstract 'telling'. It functions well as a teaching moment but less so as a 'performative event' where the 'Holy happens' (Immink) through the sheer beauty of the proclamation.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Effective integration of contemporary context (commitment-phobia and news scandals).",
      "Theological precision regarding the 'Lamb of God' as both sacrifice and liberating power.",
      "Authentic, non-manipulative tone that avoids emotional kitsch."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Shift from 'telling' to 'showing' by using more sensory, vivid imagery throughout the text.",
      "Improve the 'musicality' of the prose by varying sentence structure and removing verbal fillers.",
      "Open the conclusion to allow for more hearer-appropriation and less prescriptive moralization."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Academic-Declarative",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Thomas Long's 'Preacher as Witness' and Paul Scott Wilson's 'Four Pages' (though imagery needs work). It lacks the 'Open Work' quality of Ciska Stark.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to traditional Reformed hearers who value clarity, biblical fidelity, and practical application, but may leave those seeking 'poetic' or 'mystical' experiences underwhelmed.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the congregation with a haunting image or question.",
      "Use one central metaphor (like 'the home' or 'the road') and weave it through every section of the sermon.",
      "Practice 'stewardship of language' by cutting 10% of the words to increase the 'density' and impact of the remaining prose."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Through the lens of homiletic aesthetics, this sermon is a '6'—it is effective and clear, but it does not yet reach the level of an 'artistic event'. It is a faithful transmission of truth that would benefit from a more 'poetic turn'. By daring to be more visual and less prescriptive, the preacher could transform this from a 'good lesson' into a 'transformative encounter'."
