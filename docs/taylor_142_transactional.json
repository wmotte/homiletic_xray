    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically supportive in its validation of human suffering, avoiding the common trap of 'spiritual bypassing' early on. However, it maintains a Parent-Child dynamic that may foster dependency on the preacher's emotional cues. The transition from the 'reality of agony' to the 'victor's song' is a classic homiletical move that can inadvertently pressure the listener into an 'Adapted Child' state of forced optimism ('We are a yet people').",

      "Avoidance of harsh, judgmental 'Critical Parent' rhetoric."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Heavy reliance on emotional anecdotes rather than Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "The 'Rescuer' role in the Drama Triangle is strong, which can leave listeners feeling incapable of finding their own 'Adult' path through grief."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Incorporate more 'Adult' ego state questions that ask the listener to process their own reality, rather than just 'putting tears in it.' Shift from being the 'Master's lawyer' to a fellow traveler who invites the listener to test the 'yet' against their own current reality."
