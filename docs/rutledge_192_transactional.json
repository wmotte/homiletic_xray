    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of P-C communication. While it offers profound Nurturing Parent comfort regarding the Trinity, it relies heavily on the Critical Parent to define the listener's identity through the lens of 'miserable' sinfulness. This creates a psychological dependency where the listener must feel 'bad' to feel 'saved.'",

      "Over-reliance on shaming language ('miserable offenders', 'no health').",
      "Lack of Adult-Adult invitation for the listener to define their own spiritual state."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as 'Adults' who are capable of making moral choices, rather than 'Children' who are inherently 'miserable.' Replace the 'Bait and Switch' of Law/Grace with a consistent Adult-Adult dialogue about the reality of human experience."
