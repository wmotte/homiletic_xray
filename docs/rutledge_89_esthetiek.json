    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans heavily on the 'mighty stream' and 'water' imagery of Amos, effectively contrasting this with the 'famine' of the Word. The preacher utilizes sensory language to describe the 'nauseated' God and the 'stench' of hollow worship. While it relies significantly on the biblical text's own imagery, the preacher successfully updates this by referencing 'beds of ivory' in the context of Vanity Fair ads and the 'reflecting pool' in Washington. The imagery serves the 'show, don't tell' principle by making the spiritual void of the 1980s palpable through the metaphor of a famine not of bread, but of hearing.",
      "quotes": [
        "Yahweh was nauseated, according to the graphic biblical imagery, by his people’s hymns and prayers.",
        "The people gathered by the reflecting pool could hardly bear even to look at each other, they felt so lost.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably precise and avoids the 'Canaanite' jargon often found in Reformed-adjacent traditions. The preacher defines 'prophet' and 'saint' with clarity, reclaiming them from 'religious genius' or 'giant' status to more biblical, functional definitions. The stewardship of language is evident in the careful distinction between Dr. King’s human flaws and his divine vocation. The word choice is economical, particularly in the section describing the 'double theme' of Amos. It respects the nuance of the New Yorker article while maintaining a distinct theological voice that does not hide behind platitudes.",

        "He was neither a genius nor 'religious' but that he had been seized... commandeered by God.",

      "jargon_analysis": "Excellent. Terms like 'vocation' and 'Word of God' are contextualized rather than assumed."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a steady, pedagogical rhythm. It uses rhetorical repetition effectively, particularly the 'First, Second, Third' structure and the refrain of 'What is the source?'. However, it occasionally falls into 'paper language' during the explanatory sections about the 1960s. The musicality peaks when quoting Scripture, where the cadence of the RSV/KJV provides a poetic lift. The preacher's own prose is more functional than lyrical, though the ending achieves a certain liturgical 'legato' that would be effective in a high-church setting like Grace Church.",
      "quotes": [
        "From what spring will justice roll down like water? That mighty stream of righteousness — how do we find it?",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' typical of high-standard Anglican/Reformed preaching. It avoids the trap of flowery aestheticism while maintaining a high level of precision. The imagery is rooted in the biblical text but successfully 'reframed' for a 1983 New York audience. While the rhythm is occasionally interrupted by pedagogical asides, the overall stewardship of language is excellent, treating the congregation as mature interlocutors who value both intellectual clarity and sensory evocative power."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with an 'upsetting of equilibrium'—the sadness of the 1983 marchers and the 'lost' feeling at the reflecting pool. It moves through the 'trouble' (Amos’s judgment) to a surprising turning point: the preacher’s own realization that he had missed the 'majesty' theme in Amos. This 'aha!' moment shifts the sermon from social critique to a theological foundation. The movement from the 'famine of the word' to the 'wellspring of grace' provides a satisfying resolution, though the ending is perhaps a bit too neatly tied with parish announcements.",
      "quotes": [
        "The 'Talk of the Town' article is unutterably sad because it evokes the overwhelming sense of loss.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. Following Cilliers' concept of 'reframing,' the preacher uses the New Yorker's questions to re-read Amos, and Amos to re-read the 1983 cultural moment. The context (the 20th anniversary of MLK's speech) is not just an illustration but the lens through which the text is heard. The preacher avoids 'moralizing' the text into a simple 'we must be like MLK' and instead reframes MLK as a 'servant of God’s mighty purpose.' This synthesis respects the 'strangeness' of the 8th-century prophet while making him feel like a contributor to the 1983 Vanity Fair culture.",
      "quotes": [
        "Amos sounds so contemporary, you’d think he had been looking at the ads in Vanity Fair.",
        "The New Yorker writer... writes of the loss of the voice of Martin Luther King. Still, there is a certain connection here.",
        "The wellspring is God. It is from him that we yearn for the mighty stream of righteousness in the first place."

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon starts with significant openness, acknowledging the 'lost' feeling of the marchers and the 'unutterable sadness' of the contemporary moment. However, as it moves toward the conclusion, it becomes more 'closed.' The theological synthesis ('The wellspring is God') is powerful but leaves little room for the 'ambivalence' of why the stream often seems dry. While it avoids a 'cheap happy ending' by acknowledging MLK's martyrdom, the final appeal to parish successes (the shelter, the feeding program) risks 'sealing' the work of art with a moralistic/institutional bow.",
      "quotes": [
        "They felt so lost.",
        "God is the spring of justice... God is the mighty source.",

        "The rhetorical question at the end ('Is there any one of us who cannot...') is slightly coercive.",
        "More room could be left for the 'famine'—why does God feel absent even when we do 'good works'?",
        "The 'totally unmerited' grace could be left as a mystery rather than a fully explained 'system'."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Polyvalent in its use of MLK and Amos, but monovalent in its theological conclusion."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is sophisticated, moving from a secular lament to a biblical diagnosis and finally to a theological 'reframing.' It avoids the static nature of traditional three-point sermons by using the 'New Yorker' article as a narrative thread. The integration of text and context is exemplary, providing a 'Space for Grace' by shifting the burden of social change from human 'giants' to the 'God of hosts.' The structure is largely successful in taking the hearer on a journey from despair to a grounded, liturgical hope."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids the 'clichéd story with a happy ending' by explicitly mentioning the assassination and martyrdom of leaders. It does not offer 'immediate comfort' but forces the hearer to sit with the 'nausea' of God and the 'famine' of the Word. The preacher's self-description as a 'half-baked crusader' undercuts any 'saintly' kitsch. The emotion regarding the 1983 marchers feels authentic (sentiment vs. emotion) because it is grounded in a specific cultural observation of loss rather than vague 'churchy' sadness.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'phenomenal response' to the feeding program (slight institutional kitsch).",

      "The admission that the preacher had 'completely missed' a central theme of Amos for years."

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by the radical move of defining everyone—including the 'privileged' congregation—as the 'undeserving poor.' This levels the moral playing field and removes the 'moralistic burden' of social justice, reframing it as a response to a gift. However, the space is slightly constricted by the 'correctness' of the theological synthesis at the end. The 'mystery' of the famine of the Word is explained away a bit too quickly by the 'presence' of the Word in the sermon itself.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between 'already' and 'not yet' are sustained through the figure of MLK, but resolved quickly in the parish applications.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'might and majesty' of God is presented as a mystery, though the 'double theme' explanation makes it quite manageable.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. The 'must' of social action is derived from the 'is' of God's nature.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'famine' of Amos 8 to linger longer as a possibility for the modern church, rather than just a past or 'other' threat."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high-quality example of 'Reframing' aesthetics. It successfully bridges the gap between a high-culture secular source (The New Yorker) and a rigorous biblical text (Amos). The aesthetic power lies in its 'sober beauty'—it does not rely on emotional manipulation but on the intellectual and sensory resonance of its metaphors. By identifying the 'famine of the word' as the ultimate crisis of the 1980s, it creates a profound 'Space for Grace' that transcends simple political activism. The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long) to a double reality: the demand for justice and the overwhelming majesty of God. While the ending leans slightly toward institutional closure, the overall arc is one of authentic aesthetic depth, avoiding the kitsch of both 'social gospel' moralism and 'pietistic' escapism.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful integration of contemporary secular literature with ancient prophecy.",
      "Authentic, non-kitsch treatment of social justice and historical tragedy.",

    "audience_analysis": "Intellectually engaged, urban congregants who are wary of both political slogans and religious clichés.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'open' endings that leave the hearer with a lingering image rather than a rhetorical question.",
      "Deepen the 'sensory' descriptions of the 'wellspring' to match the 'nausea' of the beginning.",
      "Read the text aloud during drafting to identify and break up 'paper language' in historical sections."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically strong sermon that honors the 'Aesthetic Turn' by making the form of the 'reframed' life the content of the message. It avoids the 'vertical-only' trap of Thurneysen while maintaining a high view of the 'Word' as an event. It is a model of how to use cultural artifacts (The New Yorker) not as 'hooks' but as genuine partners in a theological dialogue."
