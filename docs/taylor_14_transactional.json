        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher largely avoids shaming the listener for being afraid. Instead of condemning fear as a sin, he validates it as a 'precious native endowment.' The CP only emerges briefly when describing the 'unjust judge' as 'insane.'",

        "presence_of_adaptation": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher does not use fear to demand compliance. However, the concept of being 'worthily owned' invites a form of healthy adaptation to a 'Heavenly Father' to resolve the 'fitful fever of life.'",

    "preacher_roles": {
      "rescuer": "High. The preacher positions the Gospel (and himself as its messenger) as the one who provides the 'hiding place' and the 'partner' for the helpless.",
      "persecutor": "Very Low. There is almost no blame or 'fire and brimstone' judgment.",
      "victim": "Low. The preacher identifies with the 'lonely' and 'afraid' but speaks from a position of strength."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely free of manipulative games. It utilizes a Nurturing Parent ego state to provide a 'holding environment' for the listener's anxieties. While it emphasizes dependency ('being owned'), it does so to stabilize the listener so they can face a 'world they never made.' It avoids the 'Bait & Switch' of many religious texts by being honest about the persistence of suffering.",
    "strengths": [
      "Validation of fear as a natural human instinct.",
      "Honesty about the 'bleak fact of death' and life's complexities.",
      "Avoidance of shaming the 'Adapted Child'."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The metaphor of 'possession' and 'ownership' can be psychologically regressive.",
      "Could incorporate more 'Adult' agency—how the listener can practically navigate the 'storm' beyond emotional release."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To maintain this high level of authenticity, continue to acknowledge that faith does not remove the 'storm' (Reality Testing) and avoid shifting into a Persecutor role if the listener's fear persists."
