    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses John 21 as a base, but quickly drifts into generalities about 'love' and 'mothers'. It fails to identify what is unique to THIS text (the restoration of a failed apostle) and instead treats it as a general lesson on the emotion of love.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus put the question three times to Simon: 'Lovest thou me?...Lovest thou me?...Lovest thou me?'",
        "I think what our Lord was really saying was, 'Simon, do you love me more than all of this fishing gear...'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus on the specific legal and ecclesiastical restoration of Peter. Why does Jesus use 'Simon, son of Jonas' instead of 'Peter'? What is the unique weight of the triple restoration for a denier?"
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is largely speculative and psychological rather than linguistic or historical. The preacher dismisses Maclaren's exegesis based on a personal feeling about Jesus' 'personality' rather than the Greek text or the context of Peter's earlier boast.",
      "quotes": [
        "But that does not strike me as fitting the makeup of our Lord.",
        "And where something occurred... that does not fit a personality... I think we have to take our stand on the side of what the person ordinarily or usually would do."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Engage with the Greek distinction (or lack thereof) between agape and phileo in this passage, and the historical significance of the charcoal fire (anthrakia) linking back to the denial."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application is heavily tied to Mother's Day sentimentality. While it mentions social issues (poverty, the Depression), it often falls into general 'truths' about love that Dekker explicitly forbids.",
      "quotes": [
        "The world looks for what's wrong in us, but mothers look for what is right in us.",
        "If there is no true love... nothing finally will work out right!"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move away from sentimental generalizations about motherhood and apply the text to the specific 'misery' of the contemporary hearer's own denials and failures before God."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "There is a decent flow between the biblical narrative and the preacher's anecdotes. The hearer is not left with a dry lecture, but the 'exposition' side is so thin that the 'application' dominates.",
      "quotes": [
        "So Jesus does not go into why back there Peter had denied him... But he just asked, 'Do you love me?'",
        "I think the supreme virtue of true mothers has been that great capacity to love us..."

      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application arises from the text's specificities (the 'Feed my sheep' command) rather than external themes like Mother's Day."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on misery (Peter's failure, the Depression), but it is often framed as psychological 'despair' rather than theological 'misery before God'. Redemption is present but borders on a 'social gospel' or emotional comfort.",
      "quotes": [
        "He does not ask Simon why he failed him... He does not ask Simon to explain the environmental drag...",
        "The Lord will make a way somehow; yes, he will."

      "improvement_point": "Deepen the sense of 'misery' by addressing the gravity of Peter's denial as a betrayal of the Word, not just a 'mistake' or 'nerves'."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon is almost entirely 'safe'. It lacks the 'two ways' or the seriousness of being lost. The preacher explicitly rejects the idea of a child being 'bad' and focuses on universal maternal acceptance.",
      "quotes": [
        "I think hardly two times... have I known a mother to say, 'Well my child is just a bad person.'",
        "I can fix everything right if you care about me."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the alternative: what if Peter had not answered? What is the consequence of refusing the love of Christ? The sermon needs the 'narrow way' to have weight."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the 'Who' of the sermon, which is a strong point. However, the Christology is somewhat functional—He is the one who 'makes a way' rather than the ontological Lord and God of the two-natures doctrine Dekker requires.",
      "quotes": [
        "I do not know how, but I know who.",
        "The one Lord who is central in the sermon is Christ."

      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "At approximately 2100 words, the sermon meets the 20-minute threshold. It has breadth, though the 'depth' is occasionally sacrificed for anecdotal storytelling.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Replace some of the repetitive anecdotal material with deeper exegetical 'breadth' to provide more theological substance."

  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily through its reliance on general truths and sentimentality. It prioritizes a 'Mother's Day' theme over the specific, unique content of John 21. The exegesis is based on psychological speculation ('personality of our Lord') rather than rigorous study of the text. While it meets the length requirement and maintains a focus on Christ, it lacks the 'two ways' and the concrete, non-general application Dekker demands.",
    "strengths": [
      "Adequate length (20+ minutes) allowing for 'breadth'.",
      "Strong focus on Christ as the 'Who' rather than just a 'How' (providential focus).",
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' (misery/redemption) in the context of personal and social history."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Frequent use of 'general truths' which Dekker explicitly forbids.",
      "Weak exegesis that ignores the original context of Peter's previous boasts and the specific dialogue structure.",
      "Absence of the 'two ways'; the sermon is overly comforting and lacks the seriousness of potential loss."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'speech about love' rather than a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense. It fails to extract what is unique to this specific passage and instead uses the text as a springboard for general psychological and sentimental reflections."
