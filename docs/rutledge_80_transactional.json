    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust, primarily engaging the Adult ego state. It avoids the common 'NIGYSOB' trap by including the preacher in the indictment of sin. The use of the 'Dance' metaphor successfully bridges the Free Child's need for joy with the Adult's need for ethical reality. While it uses a 'Bait & Switch' tactic to move from celestial beauty to earthly horror, it does so to provoke reflection rather than to establish a Parent-Child dependency.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement with historical and contemporary data.",
      "Avoids 'smothering' Nurturing Parent by emphasizing the 'hands too strong' are external powers."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the torture anecdote is so jarring it may cause some listeners to 'shut down' (AC retreat) rather than engage (Adult reflection).",
      "The indictment of the 'human heart' is very broad (CP)."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To remain entirely game-free, ensure the 'switch' to political critique is signposted earlier to avoid the feeling of a psychological 'trap' for the listener."
