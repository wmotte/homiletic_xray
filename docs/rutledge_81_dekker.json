    "sermon_start_end": "The prophet Jeremiah, who lived in the sixth century B.C., is tremendously interesting to modern people. For many centuries, Isaiah was the most beloved Hebrew prophet, and he is still read in the church far more than any other. In modern times, however, Jeremiah has become a favorite. [...] Blessed is the man [woman] … whose trust is the Lord. He [she] is like a tree planted by water, that sends out its roots by the stream, and does not fear when heat comes, for its leaves remain green, and is not anxious in the year of drought, for it does not cease to bear fruit. AMEN."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's first thesis by using three disparate pericopes rather than one specific passage. It functions more as a thematic speech on 'the human heart' or 'Jeremiah's psychology' than an exposition of a singular, unique word from God. It fails to identify what can be found in these texts that is nowhere else, instead harmonizing them with general biblical truths.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have taught almost every book of the Bible, and this is the only one that I felt I had to break up into various pieces according to themes",
        "The same indictment of the human heart appears in various other places in the Bible"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one pericope (e.g., 17:5-10) and exhaust its specific logic rather than jumping between chapters to support a pre-conceived psychological theme."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher shows awareness of the historical context (Babylonian invasion) but the exegesis is thin. The mention of the 'barren Judean wilderness' is a helpful specific detail, but the sermon quickly pivots to modern psychology and general dogmatics. The requirement for Hebrew/Greek knowledge is not visibly utilized to unlock the text's specific meaning.",
      "quotes": [
        "He lived through the Babylonian invasion and the fall of Jerusalem",
        "This is not like the beautiful Sonoran desert that blooms — the barren Judean wilderness is meant."

    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete, which Dekker values, but it leans heavily into 'zeitgeist' reporting (celebrity culture) rather than spiritual application derived strictly from the text. The examples of Halliburton and Blackwater are specific but risk becoming a general social commentary rather than a word for the specific congregation's spiritual life.",
      "quotes": [

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured as a lecture. It moves from historical introduction to thematic grouping, then to contemporary examples, and finally to a 'leap' to the New Testament. The hearer is not drawn into the text's movement; the text is used as a springboard for the preacher's observations.",
      "quotes": [
        "we’re going to leap over thirteen chapters and read one of the most important passages in all of Scripture."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is a strong point. The preacher takes 'misery' (the deceitful heart) seriously and does not soften it. Redemption is clearly placed outside the self (in the New Covenant). Gratitude is addressed in the final call to be a 'sign planted by God'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The human heart is desperately corrupt and beyond self-help.",
        "Our condition was hopeless, but now it is taken up into Christ’s divine life."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon explicitly references the 'two ways' via the imagery of the shrub and the tree. It touches on the seriousness of being 'lost' (perishing alone), though it focuses more on temporal/psychological loss than eternal loss.",
      "quotes": [
        "The person who trusts in human potential... is like a scrubby plant that can never thrive",
        "she perished all alone in a hotel room."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, but the connection feels dogmatically forced rather than textually derived. The 'operating system' metaphor is clever but risks making Christ a logical necessity of a system rather than the living Lord of the Jeremiah text itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "The New Testament (the New Covenant) simply does not work without the Old Testament. The Old Testament is the operating system of the New."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 16.5 minutes (1650 words), the sermon falls short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. This lack of 'breadth' results in 'leaping' over sections of the Bible, sacrificing the depth Dekker demands.",
      "improvement_point": "Increase the length to at least 2000 words to allow for the 'breadth' that depth requires, specifically by dwelling longer on the exegesis of Jeremiah 31."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s ideal primarily due to its thematic, rather than pericope-driven, structure. By 'leaping' across chapters, it sacrifices the specificity of the Word for a general discourse on human corruption and celebrity culture. While it correctly identifies the 'misery' of the human condition and points to Christ as the 'telos', it functions more as a theological lecture than a proclamatory actualization of a specific text.",
    "strengths": [
      "Serious treatment of human depravity (misery) without psychological softening.",
      "Concrete contemporary references that avoid vague moralisms.",
      "Clear identification of Christ as the necessary resolution to the human dilemma."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Failure to stick to one specific Bible passage, leading to a thematic 'speech' rather than a sermon.",
      "Insufficient duration (under 20 minutes) preventing necessary depth.",
      "Over-reliance on celebrity anecdotes which distract from the specific textual exegesis."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate theological speech, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense because it lacks the specificity of a single pericope and the required breadth for depth. It treats the Bible as a source of themes rather than a current, proclamatory Word."
