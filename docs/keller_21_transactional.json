    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically sophisticated and remarkably 'game-free.' It utilizes an Adult-Adult transaction to bypass the typical Critical Parent/Adapted Child dynamic found in many religious 'sin' discourses. By using secular thinkers like Sartre and Kafka, the preacher validates the listener's 'Adult' reality before introducing the 'Nurturing Parent' solution of the Gospel. It promotes autonomy by demanding 'full responsibility' (Adult) while offering 'free forgiveness' (Nurturing Parent), effectively silencing the internal 'Persecutor' voice.",
    "strengths": [
      "Deconstructs 'Self-Flagellation' and 'Self-Pity' as manipulative psychological cul-de-sacs.",
      "Maintains an Adult-Adult dialogue even when discussing highly emotional topics like guilt.",
      "Uses external literature to build a bridge of 'shared reality' with the listener."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the 'Antidote' relies on a sudden shift to dogmatic authority ('The only way... is to believe the Bible'), which may briefly cross the Adult transaction.",
      "The fairy tale ending is a bit 'Parental' in its simplicity compared to the earlier Adult analysis."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to externalize the 'Critical Parent' as a 'voice' the listener hears, rather than becoming that voice. This maintains the listener's Adult ego state and prevents the 'Adapted Child' response of rebellion or false compliance."
