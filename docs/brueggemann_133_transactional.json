Instead of condemning the listener for their failures, he critiques the 'unqualified agents' (external authorities) that impose burdens. The judgment is directed at the systems of oppression rather than the listener's character.",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and promotes high levels of autonomy. It uses Transactional Analysis principles effectively by identifying the 'Critical Parent' voices in the listeners' lives (teachers, parents, advertising) and offering an 'Adult' path to freedom through the 'Nurturing Parent' of the Gospel. It avoids the common homiletical trap of shaming the listener, instead focusing on the 'interruption' of grace that allows for a new, self-determined way of being.",
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent identification of externalized Critical Parent voices.",
      "Promotes Adult-to-Adult reflection through open-ended questions.",
      "Avoids the Drama Triangle by focusing on empowerment rather than guilt."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to social issues (Ferguson, etc.) could be more clearly linked to the 'Free Child's' joy to avoid sounding like a new set of 'Critical Parent' requirements."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'interrogative' style (asking questions) as it keeps the listener in the Adult ego state and prevents the preacher from slipping into a Rescuer role."
