        "score": 8,
        "score_explanation": "The preacher avoids using shame or 'must' as a primary motivator. He frames God's judgment not as a threat for the listener to avoid, but as a theological reality that highlights grace.",
        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "The Critical Parent is largely absent. Instead of demanding obedience through fear, the preacher uses the 'Uzzah' incident to explain a theological concept (holiness) rather than to coerce behavior.",

          "I have heard this preached... that this teaches us you have to follow all of the rules... if you don't follow all of God's rules, he's going to get you... Is that it? The answer is... not really."

He doesn't offer a 5-step plan to fix the listener; he offers a paradigm shift in how the listener perceives God, leaving the 'payoff' (joy) as a natural byproduct rather than a manipulated result."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and game-free. It uses the Adult ego state to dismantle the Critical Parent/Adapted Child dynamic often found in religious settings. By validating the 'Free Child' (David's dancing) through the lens of 'Adult' theological processing (the Gospel), the preacher promotes true autonomy and emotional health. The use of external sources like David Foster Wallace helps ground the spiritual concepts in universal psychological realities.",
    "strengths": [
      "Deconstruction of shame-based religion.",
      "Integration of intellectual rigor (Adult) with emotional freedom (Free Child).",
      "Avoidance of the Drama Triangle by centering the 'Rescue' on a third party (Jesus) rather than the preacher's ego."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The description of Michal's fruitlessness could be misinterpreted as a 'Parental' judgment if not carefully handled.",
      "The intensity of the 'Free Child' description (Spurgeon quote) might feel alienating to listeners currently in a 'Victim' or depressed state."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' to explain the 'Parent' (Law), as this prevents the listener from slipping into a defensive 'Adapted Child' state. Ensure that the invitation to 'dance' remains an invitation and not a new 'Critical Parent' command."
