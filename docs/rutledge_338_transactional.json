  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Redemptive Shaming.' It effectively uses the Critical Parent to break down the listener's ego ('masks,' 'fraudulence') before offering the Nurturing Parent's comfort. While theologically traditional for Good Friday, it relies on making the listener feel 'pathetic' to make the 'love' feel more powerful. This creates a cycle of dependency on the preacher/church for emotional regulation (guilt followed by relief).",

      "Clear identification of cultural idols."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on the 'pathetic' label for the congregation.",
      "The 'Bait & Switch' from praise to condemnation can feel manipulative.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult invitation for the listener to find their own meaning."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as Adults capable of moral agency rather than 'pathetic' children. Instead of telling them they are 'fraudulent,' ask them to reflect on their own experiences of 'image-making' without pre-determining the negative payoff."
