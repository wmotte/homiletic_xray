  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically complex. It uses strong Adult processing to relate biblical texts to the specific socio-economic context of Greenwich. However, it employs a 'Bait and Switch' game, moving from the Nurturing Parent's promise of comfort to the Critical Parent's demand for suffering. This risks inducing 'Adapted Child' guilt rather than 'Free Child' joy. The preacher's call to 'recklessness' is an invitation to the Free Child, but it is framed within a Parent-driven 'must.'",
    "strengths": [
      "High Adult presence in socio-economic analysis.",
      "Authentic Free Child energy in the grandmother anecdote.",
      "Avoids simplistic 'Ain't it Awful' by demanding personal responsibility."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The shift from 'comfort' to 'suffering' is jarring and potentially manipulative.",
      "Use of shaming language ('guilt-ridden weakling') to motivate change."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To remain in Adult-Adult communication, the preacher could present the 'two-part inheritance' as a choice of maturity rather than a moralistic 'must.' Instead of shaming the 'Greenwich' lifestyle, invite the congregation to Adult-level reflection on how their specific resources can be used without the 'Switch' from comfort to threat."
