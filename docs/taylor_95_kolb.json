      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a vivid sensory reconstruction of the Upper Room. It effectively grounds the hearer in a 'slice of life' that is both biblical and relatable. However, the transition from the historical 'garret room' to the contemporary 'police van' is somewhat abrupt, potentially losing the hearer who is not already socially engaged. The emotional connection is strong but leans heavily on the contrast between 'soft lights' and 'sweat and screams'.",

While the exegesis of Matthew 26:30 is the starting point, the theological development is more thematic than strictly exegetical.

    "overall_kolb_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of prophetic preaching that effectively utilizes the Diverging quadrant of Kolb’s cycle. It begins with a strong concrete experience of the Upper Room and moves into a sophisticated reflective observation of the American church’s preference for a 'polite' gospel. The theological conceptualization of Calvary as a 'standard of judgment' against material power is clear and compelling. However, the sermon falls short in the Pragmatic/Active Experimentation phase. While it provides a stirring historical example in Charles Tindley, it offers few concrete, actionable steps for the contemporary hearer beyond a general call to 'go forth'. The language is consistently high-register and poetic, which serves the Visionary structure well but may leave the Converging learner without a clear 'how-to'. The balance is tilted toward the 'feeling' and 'watching' aspects of the cycle, making it a masterpiece of inspiration but less effective as a guide for specific ethical implementation.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong example of the Visionary-Narrative style, excelling in moving the 'heart' and 'eyes' of the listener. From a Kolb perspective, it successfully completes the first three phases of the learning cycle but lacks a robust landing in Active Experimentation. It is a diagnostic success in identifying the 'problem' of a sanitized gospel and provides a clear 'normative' vision of a Calvary-centered fellowship. To move from a 6.5 to an 8, the preacher would need to bridge the gap between the 'stupendous' purposes of God and the daily ethical choices of the individual believer. The priority for improvement is the development of the Pragmatic quadrant to ensure that the 'timeless gospel' finds 'timely' expression in the concrete actions of the congregation."
