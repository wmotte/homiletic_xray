    "sermon_start_end": "Of course, every Easter all of the churches of the world celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ, but the Sunday before Easter, for centuries now, the church has also spent time observing the triumphal entry of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem just days before he was crucified. [...] He says, “I will be in your life as a King, or I won’t be in your life at all.” That’s how you meet him. That’s how you have your life changed. Let’s pray."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Luke 19 as a base but quickly moves into general themes of 'kingship' that could be derived from many other texts. It fails to identify what is unique to this specific passage that cannot be found elsewhere. The preacher even admits to ignoring parts of the text to focus on generalities.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus is trying to fulfill Scripture, which is another whole sermon. I’m not going there.",
        "Palm Sunday is about this: you can’t know Jesus Christ unless you know him as King."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus on the specific Lucan details—such as the absence of palms or the specific dialogue with the Pharisees—to find a word that is unique to this pericope rather than a general discourse on the concept of a king."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is thin. While it mentions Psalm 118 and Zechariah 9, it treats the biblical text as a springboard for cultural analysis and psychological observation. There is no evidence of engagement with the original languages or the specific historical-theological context of Luke's Gospel.",
      "quotes": [
        "What that means is that is a quotation... they’re quoting Psalm 118",
        "I think it actually helps us a bit to realize this is actually a very powerful idea that has been there in not just the Jewish Scriptures but in so many of the legendary traditions of the world."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the 'labor' of the study. Explain the specific significance of the 'Mount of Olives' or the 'peace in heaven' (vs. 'on earth') in Luke's specific theology."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part of the sermon, showing a broad knowledge of the humanities (C.S. Lewis, psychological 'memory traces', cultural trends). It is concrete in its description of the 'zeitgeist'—the fear of losing control and the 'crowning' of careers or children.",
      "quotes": [
        "In New York, people won’t even register for the conference until 10 minutes before. Because they want to keep all of their options open.",
        "If you’re living for your career... you’ve crowned it. That career is driving you."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application flows strictly from the text's exposition rather than from a general psychological framework applied to the text."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a 'lecture' structure (three points) where exposition and application are often kept in separate blocks. The hearer is told about the text and then told about their life, rather than being 'expounded' through the text itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let’s look at this passage and let’s notice from this passage that it teaches us he’s, first, the true King; secondly, the weak King; and thirdly, how he can be your King."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Abandon the 'three-point' structure in favor of a narrative movement where the text's details immediately illuminate the hearer's reality."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The categories are present. Misery is defined as the 'oppression' of false kings (idolatry). Redemption is the 'weak King' bearing judgment. Gratitude is expressed through worship and obedience. However, the 'misery' feels more like a psychological problem than a theological 'misery before God'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Your problems are because the things you have crowned in your life are oppressing you.",
        "I come not to bring judgment; I come to bear judgment."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Sharpen the 'misery' aspect to be less about 'unhappiness' or 'lack of control' and more about the radical lostness of man before the Holy God."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon concludes with a sharp call to decision. It takes the hearer seriously as a responsible being. The choice is 'Crown me or kill me'. It addresses the 'temporal loss' of serving false lords and the necessity of the 'yoke'.",
      "quotes": [
        "He was saying, 'Crown me or kill me,' and that’s what they did. They killed him.",
        "I will be in your life as a King, or I won’t be in your life at all."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'two ways' more explicitly to the eternal destination mentioned by Dekker, rather than focusing primarily on psychological flourishing."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon emphasizes the 'two natures' (Creator and Redeemer) and points to salvation outside of the self. The 'weak King' section effectively communicates that grace is the deepest reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "He’s the only one in the universe who can control us without destroying us.",
        "I’m taking the divine wrath on human sin that the human race deserves on that cross so I can forgive you."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this focus but ensure it remains tied to the specific Lucan portrayal of Christ in this passage."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At approximately 34 minutes, the sermon provides the 'breadth' required for 'depth'. It allows time for cultural analysis and theological reflection.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Use the time more for textual exposition (Thesis 2) and less for anecdotal illustrations."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short primarily on the formal requirement of being an 'exposition' of a 'specific' Bible passage. It functions more as a topical address on 'Kingship' using Luke 19 as an illustration. While it is strong in its psychological application and its Christocentric focus, it lacks the rigorous exegetical grounding Dekker demands. The preacher's own admission of 'not going there' regarding textual details confirms a lack of specificity.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective analysis of the zeitgeist and the 'idols' of modern life.",
      "Strong Christological focus on the 'weak King' as the substitute for judgment.",
      "Adequate length to allow for substantive reflection."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Weak exegesis; the original context and linguistic nuances are ignored.",
      "Lack of specificity; the sermon addresses 'kingship' in general rather than the unique contribution of Luke 19.",
      "Over-reliance on psychological categories at the expense of theological ones."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an effective religious speech, but it is only partially a 'sermon' by Dekker's definition. It fails the 'bicycle mechanic' test by not properly mounting the 'wheel' of specific textual exposition."
