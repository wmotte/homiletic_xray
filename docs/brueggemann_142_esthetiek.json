    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively utilizes the biblical imagery of the 'lame man' to create a visual anchor for the theological argument. By repeating the sequence 'a man, this man, the man,' the preacher forces the listener to 'behold' the physical reality of the body. The imagery of 'walking and leaping and praising God' is contrasted sharply with the 'stagnation' of the empire. While the imagery is grounded in the text, the preacher successfully translates the 'Beautiful Gate' into contemporary 'cracks' in the system. However, the imagery remains somewhat binary (Empire vs. Kingdom) and could benefit from more sensory detail regarding the 'military capitalism' it critiques to avoid becoming purely conceptual.",
      "quotes": [
        "Habeas corpus; we have the body! We have the living, breathing, lively body.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "The sermon leans toward 'showing' the biblical narrative but 'telling' the political application. The biblical scene is painted vividly, while the critique of capitalism relies on naming concepts rather than showing their effects."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise, characteristic of a 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre). The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' in favor of provocative, modern terminology like 'military capitalism,' 'status quo,' and 'exclusionary ways.' Every word feels intentional, particularly the rhythmic repetition of 'Have you noticed?' which serves to implicate the listener without being crudely accusatory. The distinction between 'generic sin' and 'collusion with empire' shows a high degree of theological nuance. The use of the Latin 'Habeas corpus' is a clever rhetorical move that bridges the legal, the physical, and the theological.",
      "quotes": [
        "The empire of fear among us wants a long season of stagnation, that votes always for the status quo.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a strong oral cadence. The use of anaphora ('Have you noticed...', 'He is the man who...') creates a rhythmic drive that mirrors the 'leaping' of the man in the text. There is a clear variation in sentence length—short, punchy declarations ('Ecce homo!', 'Witness is practice.') are interspersed with longer, more complex reflections. The rhythm builds toward the end of each section, creating a sense of momentum. It is clearly 'oral language' designed to be heard, with a natural flow that prevents the 'paper language' feel of more academic sermons.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ecce homo! Behold the man! Here is the man!",

    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by a 'sober beauty' and prophetic precision. By reclaiming the 'Ecce Homo' motif, the preacher creates a visual and rhythmic center that holds the sermon together. The language is clear, avoiding traditional pietistic jargon in favor of a vocabulary that is both biblically grounded and politically charged. The musicality is high, driven by repetitive structures that mirror the movement from paralysis to praise. It is an aesthetically strong example of language as an instrument of 'reframing' reality."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by upsetting the equilibrium—reframing 'Ecce Homo' from Jesus to a nameless beggar. This creates immediate tension: why look at the beggar? The movement then shifts from the individual healing to the social conflict (the 'annoyance' of the authorities), and finally to the invitation for the congregation to find themselves in the story. The 'turning point' is the realization that the church, not just Jesus, performs this transformation. However, the transition between the sections on 'Empire' and 'Witness' feels slightly more like a thematic shift than a narrative progression.",
      "quotes": [
        "The narrator cannot finish with him, and will not let him go.",
        "It is simply astonishing that the preaching of the resurrection leads to a confrontation.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. It is a masterclass in 'reframing' (Cilliers). The preacher does not merely apply the text; he allows the text to provide a new lens through which to view modern 'empires' of fear and stagnation. The connection between the 'lame man' and those 'discounted' by military capitalism is surprising yet feels exegetically grounded in the conflict described in Acts 4. The 'strangeness' of the text—that the authorities are annoyed by a healing—is used to expose the strangeness of our own world. It avoids the 'two-block' problem by weaving the context into the exegesis itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "The empire has a vested interest in keeping folks disabled, dependent, needy, and intimidated.",
        "Resurrection is no mere idea. It is rather the move toward the new future.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is rhetorically powerful, it leans toward a 'closed' structure in its political application. The definitions of 'Empire' are quite specific and leave little room for alternative interpretations of the 'context.' However, it remains an 'open work of art' (Stark) in its conclusion, where it invites the hearer to choose which role they will play: the authority, the crowd, or the man. By ending with the possibility of being 'that man,' it leaves the 'ending' of the sermon to be written by the lives of the listeners. The use of 'maybe, just maybe' provides a necessary aesthetic space for the hearer's agency.",
      "quotes": [
        "Those addressed by Peter were invited to decide, to opt for the time of refreshment.",
        "We play all these roles...",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The political critique is somewhat monovalent; allowing for more 'polyphony' in how empire is experienced could open the work.",

        "Leave more room for the 'mystery' of the healing itself before moving to the political meaning."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily an open work due to its concluding invitation, though the middle sections are rhetorically 'sealed' by a strong ideological framework."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is driven by a powerful 'reframing' of the biblical narrative. It moves from the 'micro' of a single healed body to the 'macro' of imperial stagnation. The structure is not a static list of points but a movement of 'perception'—learning to see the world through the 'crack' of the resurrection. While the socio-political critique is quite pointed, the sermon maintains aesthetic openness by ending with a liturgical summons rather than a moralistic checklist."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by emphasizing that the healing leads directly to arrest and conflict. There is no 'sentimentality' regarding the lame man; he is 'bodily evidence' and a 'notable sign,' not a heart-tugging prop. The preacher refuses 'cheap comfort,' instead highlighting the 'annoyance' and 'resistance' that true grace provokes. The focus on 'military capitalism' and 'stagnation' provides a gritty, realistic counterpoint to the 'pre-chewed' emotions of typical Easter sermons. It is authentic in its acknowledgment of fear and the difficulty of 'witness.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None identified; the sermon actively deconstructs kitsch-like 'spiritualized' versions of the resurrection.",
      "Avoids the cliché of 'Jesus heals all your problems' by showing the healing causes more problems with the authorities."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the empire 'grudgingly trickling out food stamps'—a sharp, un-beautified reality.",
      "The admission that the apostles must 'play it all by ear,' acknowledging the uncertainty of faith."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of 'un-beautified' proclamation; it is the strongest defense against the 'kitschification' of the Easter message."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) by presenting the resurrection as a 'time of refreshing' that is unavailable to imperial administration. It honors the 'mystery' of the Spirit that is 'not confined to exclusionary ways.' However, the space is slightly narrowed by a strong moral/political imperative. While it avoids 'cheap grace,' it occasionally risks 'moralizing the gospel' into a political program. The 'space' is most effectively opened in the 'Ecce Homo' moments where the focus is on the sheer, unmerited 'notable sign' of the healed body.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'already' of the healing and the 'not yet' of the empire's defeat is well-sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'how' of the healing is left as a 'notable sign,' respecting the mystery of the Spirit's work.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the description of the 'time of refreshing,' though moralization appears in the specific policy critiques.",
    "recommendation": "To create more space, allow the 'wonder and amazement' of the crowd to linger longer before moving to the 'critique of empire.'"

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high level of homiletic aesthetics, particularly in the tradition of 'Reframing.' Its primary strength lies in its ability to take a well-known biblical motif ('Ecce Homo') and pivot the congregation's gaze toward a contemporary, physical, and systemic reality. The language is 'stewarded' with great care, using rhythm and precise vocabulary to dismantle religious and political clichés. It avoids kitsch by embracing the 'trouble' that grace causes in the world. While the structure is rhetorically forceful, it maintains an 'openness' by inviting the listener into a performance of witness rather than a mere acceptance of doctrine. The aesthetic experience is one of 'sober beauty'—it does not rely on emotional manipulation but on the sharp, clear 'imaging' of a world interrupted by the Spirit. It is a 'performance of transformative energy' that honors both the biblical text and the complexities of the modern context.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the 'Ecce Homo' motif from Christ to the healed man.",
      "Exceptional 'stewardship of language' that is precise, rhythmic, and free of kitsch.",

    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase sensory imagery within the contemporary critique to match the vividness of the biblical scenes.",
      "Smooth the transition of academic/political quotes (Gramsci) to maintain the oral 'flow'.",

    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Reframing: A style that uses sharp language and biblical imagery to challenge and re-orient the listener's perception of reality.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Witness' model of Thomas Long, with the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to listeners who value intellectual rigor, social justice, and a 'sober' rather than 'sentimental' faith experience.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'poetic-imagistic' approach to the Spirit's work to balance the 'academic-declarative' tone.",
      "Use a contemporary 'story' of transformation to ground the systemic critique in a concrete 'body'.",
      "Deepen the 'musicality' by exploring more 'legato' passages of reflection between the 'staccato' critiques."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust 'event' that successfully creates a 'space for grace' amidst the 'stagnation of empire.' It is a model of how form (the sequence of 'this man') can become content (the reality of the resurrection). By refusing the 'religious kitsch' of a spiritualized Easter, it offers a 'notable sign' of the gospel's power. It is a 7.5/10: a strong, effective, and well-considered work that excels in language care and integration, with only minor room for more sensory 'showing' and interpretive 'openness.'"
