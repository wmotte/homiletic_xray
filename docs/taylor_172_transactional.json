    "psychological_health_score": 2,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. It utilizes 'fear-appeal' by anchoring the concept of Divine Judgment in childhood memories of corporal punishment. By suggesting that one can 'go so far' that they lose the ability to repent (the Pops Swinton example), the preacher creates a 'double-bind' of anxiety. While theologically traditional in some circles, the psychological impact is to create dependency on the 'Rescuer' (the church/preacher) rather than fostering a mature, Adult-to-Adult relationship with the Divine.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as capable Adults. Instead of using fear to bypass their reasoning, present the 'here-and-now' consequences of spiritual choices. Avoid 'Bait and Switch' tactics regarding the nature of mercy."
