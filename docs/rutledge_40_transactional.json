    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in homiletics. By speaking from the Adult ego position, the preacher validates the listener's skepticism and the reality of suffering without resorting to Critical Parent dogmatism or Rescuer fantasies. He avoids the 'Bait & Switch' by being honest about the 'inconclusive' nature of Jesus' miracles. The impact is one of empowerment through honesty, promoting a 'Free Child' joy that is grounded in reality rather than denial.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name the 'ambiguity' of the situation. This prevents the 'Con' of a simple solution and keeps the communication in a healthy Adult-Adult space."
