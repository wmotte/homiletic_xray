    "psychological_health_score": 2,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically heavy and coercive. It utilizes a dominant Critical Parent ego position to induce guilt and shame in the listener (Adapted Child). While the theological intent is to promote social justice (charity over ritual), the psychological delivery relies on the threat of divine rejection and the 'NIGYSOB' game. This creates a 'transactional' faith where God's love is a commodity bought with 'good works,' potentially leading to religious scrupulosity and a lack of authentic, Free Child joy.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Heavy reliance on shame-based motivation.",
      "Conditional presentation of Divine Grace.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult invitation for the listener to reflect on their own motivations."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Shift from 'You must/God is disgusted' (CP) to 'Let us observe the effects of our actions' (Adult). Instead of threatening the listener with God's withdrawal, explore the inherent beauty of charity from a Free Child perspective—focusing on the joy of the 'other' rather than the 'cleansing' of the self."
