    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably game-free. It utilizes an Adult-Adult transaction to dismantle the Critical Parent/Adapted Child dynamic common in wartime nationalistic preaching. By identifying with the 'rebellious house,' the preacher avoids the Drama Triangle and promotes a healthy sense of 'I'm OK, You're OK' based on shared human limitation and divine grace rather than moral superiority.",

      "High level of reality-testing (Adult ego state).",

    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The use of 'damned fool' and 'filthy rags' imagery, while biblically grounded, carries a slight risk of triggering an Adapted Child response in more sensitive listeners."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' to mediate between the 'Parent' (Law) and 'Child' (Experience). The use of historical figures like Lincoln is an excellent 'Adult' anchor."
