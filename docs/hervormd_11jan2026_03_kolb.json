    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon attempts to facilitate concrete experience by vivid descriptions of the woman's suffering and isolation. However, it often shifts quickly into theological explanation. The connection to the modern hearer's life world is present through the mention of COVID-19 and psychological struggles (burn-out), but these remain somewhat illustrative rather than immersive. The emotional connection is established primarily through the 'misery' of the character rather than a shared contemporary experience.",

        "We weten misschien nog een beetje wat, het is alweer een paar jaar terug natuurlijk, van Covid. Als je dan positief bevonden was, dan moest je in isolement.",

      "homiletical_manifestations": "Hook in the introduction via the children's notebook; narrative retelling of the woman's 12-year struggle; analogy with pandemic isolation."
    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Reflective observation is present but often bypassed in favor of immediate theological categorization. The preacher asks 'Why is this so?' regarding the woman's fear and the nature of sin, but the answers provided are dogmatic rather than exploratory. There is limited space for the hearer to struggle with the 'problem' of unanswered medical prayers or the silence of God, as the sermon moves quickly to the solution in Christ.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the strongest phase of the sermon. The preacher provides a robust theological framework, linking the narrative to the doctrine of sin, the 'ordo salutis' (calling, faith, justification), and the substitutionary atonement. The exegesis of the word 'daughter' and the mechanics of faith as an 'instrument' (middel) are logically developed and grounded in Reformed tradition (quoting Luther, Spurgeon, and Ryle).",

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon concludes with concrete calls to action, specifically 'fleeing to Jesus' and 'pleading on the promises'. While these are central to the faith, they remain somewhat internal/spiritualized. The call to 'openly confess' is a more concrete social application. The sermon provides a 'how-to' for the soul in distress, though it lacks specific ethical applications for daily social life outside the church context.",
      "quotes": [
        "Vlucht tot Jezus. [...] Ga naar Hem toe met de belofte en pleit op die belofte. Raak Hem aan met Zijn woorden door het geloof.",

    "summary": "This sermon is a solid example of traditional Reformed preaching that prioritizes theological clarity and the 'ordo salutis'. It successfully moves through the biblical narrative of the woman with the issue of blood, using it as a template for the sinner's journey to Christ. The sermon's greatest strength lies in its 'Abstract Conceptualization', where it provides a clear, logical, and biblically-grounded definition of faith as an instrument of grace. It effectively addresses the 'Assimilating' learner through systematic points and authoritative quotes from church tradition. However, the sermon falls short in the 'Visionary' and 'Diverging' aspects; the language is functional rather than evocative, and it offers little room for imaginative engagement or multiple perspectives on the text. The 'Active Experimentation' is present but remains largely confined to the internal spiritual life (believing, praying, confessing), with minimal application to the hearer's external social or ethical reality. While the COVID-19 analogy is a strong attempt at 'Concrete Experience', the sermon quickly retreats into dogmatic categories, potentially distancing the hearer from the raw emotional reality of the narrative.",

    "conclusion": "From a Kolb perspective, this sermon is 'unbalanced' but effective within its specific tradition. It functions primarily as a theological lecture wrapped in a narrative shell. It succeeds in moving the hearer from a state of 'misery' (Reflective Observation of sin) to 'deliverance' (Abstract Conceptualization of grace), but the 'gratitude' (Active Experimentation) is limited to liturgical and devotional acts. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'abstract truth' and the 'lived experience' of the congregation, ensuring that the 'hands' (action) and 'eyes' (imagination) are as engaged as the 'head' (logic)."
