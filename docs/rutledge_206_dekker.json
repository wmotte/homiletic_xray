  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on a single specific passage. It treats Romans 1, Romans 8, and John 3 as a thematic cluster. Consequently, it lacks the specificity Dekker demands; it speaks about 'the gospel' as a general idea rather than extracting what can be found 'nowhere else' in a single pericope.",
      "quotes": [
        "St. Paul had attitudes like this in mind when he wrote to the Christians in Rome, 'I am not ashamed of the gospel.'",
        "The role of the Spirit is elaborated in the Gospel of John.",
        "We are like Nicodemus in this morning’s gospel."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select either Romans 8:1-4 or John 3:1-8. Do not jump between them to support a thematic argument about 'shame' or 'justice'."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is basic historical context regarding Paul's status as a Pharisee and Roman citizen, and a brief mention of the Greek 'skandalon' and 'parakletos'. However, the exegesis remains on the surface of general biblical knowledge rather than deep textual exposition.",
      "quotes": [
        "Paul himself was a man of towering intellectual stature and considerable privilege. He was not only a Pharisee of the highest class, he was also a Roman citizen.",
        "The Spirit is called the Paraclete, a Greek word meaning advocate, or—get this—lawyer for the defense."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the linguistic and theological tension within the specific text. For example, explore the legal mechanics of 'condemning sin in the flesh' in Romans 8:3 in its 1st-century context."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part of the sermon. The preacher uses concrete contemporary examples (Larry King, Pew Research, San Quentin) to challenge the 'nice people' of the congregation. It avoids vague moralism by naming specific social categories (Republican, rich, elite).",
      "quotes": [
        "The happiest people in America are (1) rich, (2) Republican, and (3) religious.",
        "Maybe that person is your rival in business, or your first wife, or even one of your children."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application flows strictly from the text's unique point rather than using the text as a hook for a pre-conceived social commentary on 'retributive justice'."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon moves back and forth between the prison interview and the Pauline text. It attempts to 'expound' the hearer alongside the text, though the thematic jumping between three different Bible passages disrupts the movement.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now to all those who are affluent churchgoers, like all of us here in Linville... the unvarnished gospel of Christ crucified still presents itself under the heading of foolishness."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus the interwoven movement on one text so the 'present of revelation' is not diluted by cross-referencing."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The three parts are present in the background. Misery is identified as the 'law of sin and death' and the 'shame' of the elite. Redemption is clearly extra nos (Christ's work). Gratitude is implied in the 'new life of the Spirit'.",
      "quotes": [
        "He took upon himself the condemnation of the law that hands human beings over to trial and judgment and execution.",
        "In the Cross of Christ, retributive justice... is replaced by restorative justice."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'misery' of the 'nice people' in the pews more acute; the sermon focuses heavily on the misery of prisoners, which might allow the congregation to remain detached."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on the 'two ways' through the contrast of 'flesh' and 'spirit' and the concept of being 'lost in time' (unreformed life). However, the ultimate seriousness of eternal loss is softened by the focus on social 'embarrassment'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The first is the law that condemns people and imprisons them without hope—he calls that the law of the flesh, or the law of sin and death.",
        "Somebody, somewhere does not want you to be a new person in Jesus Christ... It would embarrass them."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the gravity of the 'law of sin and death' not just as a lack of 'newness' but as a definitive 'destruction' (the broad way)."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon emphasizes that salvation is outside of man ('fulfilled for us') and that Christ is the one who bears the condemnation. The doctrine of grace is central.",
      "quotes": [
        "In him, because he was perfectly righteous, the just requirement of the law is fulfilled for us.",
        "Man has no life in himself, it is Christ who is his life."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'new birth' in John 3 more strictly to the 'Christus pro me' to avoid it sounding like a psychological transformation."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1650 words, the sermon likely lasts 16-17 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for 'depth'.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section to allow the text's specific voice to speak longer before moving to contemporary illustrations."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short primarily on its formal structure: it lacks a single specific Bible passage, instead weaving together three distinct texts to serve a thematic goal. It also fails Dekker's length requirement. However, it succeeds in its concrete application and its clear Christocentric focus on restorative justice.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application that challenges the specific socio-economic context of the congregation.",
      "Strong emphasis on the 'extra nos' character of grace and Christ's substitutionary work.",
      "Effective use of contemporary media (Larry King) to illustrate the 'scandal' of the gospel."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of a specific pericope; the sermon is a topical speech about 'the gospel' rather than an exposition of one text.",
      "Insufficient length to achieve the 'breadth' Dekker requires for theological depth.",
      "The exegesis is secondary to the contemporary illustrations."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a strong 'speech about the gospel' but, according to Dekker's strict definition, it is not yet a 'sermon' because it does not rest upon one specific Bible passage and lacks the required 20-minute breadth."
