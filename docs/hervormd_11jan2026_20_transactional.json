  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and supportive. It utilizes a strong Nurturing Parent ego state to address the natural anxieties of church leadership. While it flirts with the Drama Triangle by emphasizing the 'Victim' status of the human (empty hands), it does so to promote a healthy dependency on a higher power rather than a pathological dependency on the preacher. The transition from the 'High Bar' (Critical Parent) to 'Grace' (Nurturing Parent) is handled without manipulative 'Bait & Switch' tactics.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of empathy and validation of the listener's inner state.",
      "Preacher models vulnerability by sharing his own limitations.",
      "Avoids moralistic finger-pointing."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Could strengthen the Adult ego position by providing more concrete 'how-to' examples of healthy boundaries.",
      "The 'empty hands' metaphor can sometimes discourage the use of actual human talents (Adult skills)."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To remain game-free, ensure that the 'nothingness' of the human doesn't become a 'Gimmick' for passivity. Encourage the Adult ego to develop skills while maintaining the Nurturing Parent's spiritual comfort."
