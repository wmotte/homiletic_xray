    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in using concrete, provocative imagery to bridge the 'then' and 'now.' The central metaphor of the 'Stealth Bomber' is a masterclass in Cilliers' concept of reframing. It takes a symbol of ultimate, invisible worldly power and subverts it to describe the Incarnation. The preacher avoids the 'gruesome fascination' of physical crucifixion details, opting instead for the 'imagery of shame' and 'darkness at noon.' This choice aligns with Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' by evoking the atmosphere of state-sponsored execution and the 'stench' of political reality rather than just theological abstraction. The contrast between the '48-million-dollar Stealth bomber' and the 'legions of angels' creates a vivid mental scale for the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Incarnation of the Son of God is the true Stealth bomber; it is the might of the Creator himself in disguise. He has come in under the radar, as it were.",
        "The Crucifixion of Christ was not a rogue action taking place back in the forest or up in the mountains... it was a state-sponsored method of execution.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is sophisticated and precise, reflecting McEntyre’s 'stewardship of language.' The preacher carefully distinguishes between 'sentiment' and 'emotion,' and between 'religion' (human-made) and the 'Cross' (divine disclosure). There is a clear effort to avoid 'Canaanite jargon' by defining terms like 'opus alienum' and 'Alpha and Omega' within the flow of the narrative. However, the tone occasionally veers into the academic ('academic theory,' 'intellectually handicapped'), which risks distancing the hearer. The precision in describing the crucifixion as 'government-sanctioned' rather than just 'sad' adds a necessary layer of political realism that honors the text's historical weight.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a dignified, oratorical rhythm, particularly in the concluding sections. It uses parallelism effectively ('a war against sin, a war against evil...'). However, some sections, particularly the middle portion discussing the Internet and academic theories, feel more like 'paper language'—logical and argumentative rather than rhythmic or poetic. The cadences at the beginning and end are strong, but the middle lacks the 'staccato/legato' variation that characterizes high-quality oral performance. It reads like a well-written essay that requires a very skilled speaker to prevent it from sounding monotonous.",
      "quotes": [
        "It seemed that day that there was an obliteration of love, an annihilation of life, an extermination of goodness, a total eclipse of God.",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon demonstrates a high level of linguistic stewardship. It successfully 'reframes' the Cross using contemporary military imagery, avoiding the clichés of religious kitsch. While the middle section is somewhat academic and 'bureaucratic' in its structure, the overall use of imagery is evocative and precise. The preacher avoids sentimentalism, opting for a 'sober beauty' that aligns with Reformed aesthetics. The language is clear, authoritative, and intellectually engaging, though it occasionally prioritizes logical argument over poetic cadence."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot.' It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' by introducing the NATO bombing and the rare ecumenical consensus, immediately raising the stakes: is Good Friday relevant to global violence? The movement then shifts from the macro (geopolitics) to the micro (the Internet/community) and finally to the theological core (the 'strange work' of God). The turning point is the identification of the Cross as the 'true Stealth bomber.' The tension is sustained by refusing to give easy 'answers' to suffering, instead leading the hearer into the 'darkness at noon.' The conclusion offers a resolution not through explanation, but through the 'completed work' of the Lamb.",
      "quotes": [
        "Good Friday is relevant to this or it is relevant to nothing.",
        "God did not give us an 'answer'; he gave his only Son. What we offer today is the divine drama: the King must die.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. It embodies Cilliers' 'reframing.' By placing the Roman execution of Jesus alongside NATO bombings and the 'State Department,' the preacher strips the biblical text of its 'stained-glass' distance. The 'context' is not just a 'bridge' but the very lens through which the 'text' is rediscovered. The integration of 1 Corinthians (the foolishness of the Cross) with the modern obsession with 'power' and 'success' is organic. The sermon respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the *opus alienum*) and uses it to challenge the contemporary 'sentimental culture.'",

        "The Crucifixion... wasn't part of a little 'dirty war' that the State Department of the day could disown.",
        "Do you think that a 48-million-dollar Stealth bomber is powerful? It is nothing compared to God's power.",

      "strengths": [
        "Surprising but natural connection between ancient execution and modern warfare.",

        "The 'academic scholars' context feels like an inside-baseball concern for the preacher rather than the congregation."

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon strikes a balance between the 'closed' nature of dogmatic proclamation ('It is finished') and the 'openness' of the human experience of abandonment. Following Stark’s 'open work of art,' the preacher does not offer 'satisfactory answers' to the problem of evil. Instead, the sermon invites the hearer to stand at the 'foot of the Cross' and inhabit the darkness. It is polyvalent in that it addresses the political, the communal, and the deeply personal (loneliness, pain). However, the preacher's strong stance against 'trendy scholars' and 'religious fraud' creates a somewhat 'closed' rhetorical boundary that might feel exclusionary to those struggling with intellectual doubt.",
      "quotes": [
        "There are no satisfactory answers to these questions about God's apparent failure to act. We do not offer 'answers' today.",
        "If you know what it is like to feel abandoned by God... Good Friday is for you.",
        "The paradox of the Crucifixion... makes no earthly sense, but it is this 'strange work' which enables us to hold on in the dark."

      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' and the silence of God.",
        "Ends with an invitation to 'see' and 'hear' rather than a moralistic 'must'.",

    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is robust and dramatically engaged. It avoids the static 'three-point' sermon by creating a movement from the geopolitical 'visible' to the theological 'invisible.' The integration of text and context is exemplary, providing a genuine 'reframing' of the Good Friday event for a modern audience. While the sermon occasionally lapses into a lecture-like format with numbered points and academic asides, it successfully sustains the tension of the 'darkness at noon' and respects the mystery of the *opus alienum*."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a powerful antidote to religious kitsch. It explicitly attacks 'sentimental culture' and the 'soft, fuzzy sort of love' (warm puppies). By focusing on 'shame,' 'dehumanization,' and 'state-sponsored execution,' it takes the pain of the world seriously. There are no 'happy endings' offered here, only the 'strange work' of a God who is 'abandoned by God.' This is authentic aesthetic depth that refuses to resolve the 'darkness' with cheap comfort. The preacher's insistence that the Cross 'makes no earthly sense' is the ultimate rejection of kitsch's need for easy, pre-chewed meaning.",

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened precisely through the 'Stealth' metaphor—grace is that which comes 'under the radar' of our expectations. By sustaining the tension of the 'darkness' and the 'abandonment,' the preacher creates a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) that is not forced or moralized. The sermon does not end with a list of duties (moralization) but with the 'completed work' of Christ. The 'space' is the darkness of the grave where God is 'invisibly at work.' This respects the mystery and the 'unavailable' nature of divine action.",
    "tension_sustained": "High. The preacher refuses to explain away the 'strange work' of God.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes. The 'Crucified God' is presented as a paradox, not a puzzle to be solved.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. The 'work' is Christ's, not the hearer's.",

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'Reframing Homiletics.' It successfully navigates the 'aesthetic turn' by recognizing that the form of the sermon (the Stealth Bomber metaphor) is inseparable from its content (the hidden power of God). It avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by staring directly into the 'shame' and 'abandonment' of Good Friday, refusing to offer the 'soft, fuzzy love' of sentimentalism. The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long) rather than a mere teacher, though the academic background of the preacher occasionally intrudes upon the poetic flow. The integration of contemporary military-political reality with ancient Christology is seamless and provocative, creating a 'sober beauty' that is characteristic of the best Reformed homiletics. While the middle section on digital community and academic theories slightly weakens the dramaturgical arc, the powerful opening and the 'dark' conclusion provide a compelling aesthetic experience that opens significant 'space for grace.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "The 'Stealth Bomber' metaphor as a brilliant tool for theological reframing.",
      "The rigorous rejection of religious kitsch and sentimentalism.",

      "Experiment with more 'staccato' rhythms in the middle sections to maintain oral energy.",
      "Use more 'sensory' descriptions of the biblical scenes to balance the conceptual metaphors.",
      "Trust the 'Stealth' metaphor enough to let it carry the whole sermon without reverting to numbered points."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a sophisticated and aesthetically 'honest' meditation. It honors the Good Friday tradition not through repetition of clichés, but through a daring 'perception' of God's power in the midst of worldly defeat. It is a model of how to use contemporary imagery to reveal the 'alien work' of God without succumbing to the superficiality of kitsch. Its aesthetic success lies in its ability to hold the 'darkness at noon' as a space where the holy happens."
