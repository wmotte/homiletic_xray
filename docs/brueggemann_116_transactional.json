    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and promotes high levels of autonomy. It avoids the traditional 'Critical Parent' trap of religious discourse by using the Adult ego state to analyze the 'royal routines' of life. By identifying the listener's potential fear (Adapted Child) and offering a 'second sight' (Adult/Free Child), the preacher empowers the audience rather than shaming them. The emphasis on 'doable miracles' and 'human agency' prevents the development of dependency (ITHY game).",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I bid you' and 'I ask you to think' instead of 'You must.' This maintains the 'I'm OK, You're OK' stance."
