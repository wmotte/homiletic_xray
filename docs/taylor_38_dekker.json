[...] I heard the voice of Jesus say, 'Tam this dark world's Light; Look unto me thy morn shall rise, And all thy days be bright.'"

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to treat the specific Bible passage as a unique word. Instead of recreating Isaiah 45:22 into a 'new, current, proclamatory word', the preacher uses the text as a hook for a historical anecdote about Spurgeon. The sermon does not ask what is in this passage that can be found nowhere else; it treats the text as a general slogan for 'looking to Jesus'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The untutored, unprepared substitute preacher chose as a text that day this passage that is our text for the morning"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Abandon the biographical focus on Spurgeon and King. Analyze the specific context of Isaiah 45—the Cyrus oracles and the polemic against idols—to find the unique 'proclamatory word' of this specific text."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "Exegesis is almost entirely absent. There is no mention of the historical context of the Babylonian exile or the specific theology of Deutero-Isaiah. The preacher briefly mentions Isaiah 6, but this is a different biblical context entirely. There is no evidence of the 'requirement of exposition' (Hebrew/Greek/History) Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "The sixth chapter of Isaiah has the unforgettable account..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explain the significance of 'all the ends of the earth' in the context of Israel's exile and the rise of Persia, rather than treating it as a universalist platitude."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is largely psychological and individualistic, bordering on the 'general truths' Dekker forbids. Defining salvation as 'finding your own key' or 'lifestyle' reduces the Gospel to self-actualization. While it mentions Martin Luther King Jr., it does so as a personal spiritual experience rather than a concrete ethical or political application of the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "So many of us need to find our own key, our gift, our pace, our lifestyle, our work under God.",
        "That is what it means to be saved, to be 'whole'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move away from 'religious psychology' and 'self-help' definitions of salvation. Apply the text to the concrete 'zeitgeist' of the congregation's actual social and spiritual reality."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is no interwovenness because there is no real exposition. The sermon consists of a series of stories (Spurgeon, King) followed by moralizing reflections. The hearer is not 'drawn into the text' but into the biographies of famous Christians.",
      "quotes": [
        "Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. writes about how he turned one night to look unto the Lord"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Structure the sermon so that the movement of the biblical text itself dictates the movement of the application, rather than using stories as a substitute for the Word."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The 'misery' is present but framed as 'unhappiness' or 'spiritual distress' rather than misery before God. 'Redemption' is present as 'looking to Christ', but it leans toward a subjective experience of 'wholeness' rather than the objective work of the Lord. The Trinitarian background Dekker requires is weak.",
      "quotes": [
        "Trace almost all of our unhappiness to its hiding place and you will discover that so much of it goes back to the fact that we need to be saved."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the concept of misery beyond 'unhappiness' to the theological reality of being lost without God's specific intervention."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The sermon lacks the 'seriousness of choice' or the possibility of being lost. It presents God as a 'solver of all problems' and a 'resting place', but fails to address the 'narrow way' or the 'ultimate possibilities of life design'. It is a 'safe' sermon where man is not truly brought to a point of responsible decision.",
      "quotes": [
        "God in Christ is the answer for all problems. He is true healing for all sickness."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the 'two ways' by showing the gravity of the choice to 'look' or 'not look' to God, emphasizing that life is a journey with a purpose, not a vacation."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the 'telos' of the sermon, and the preacher correctly identifies that salvation is outside of man. However, the Christology is somewhat 'thin', relying on hymns and sentimental imagery rather than the 'doctrine of the two natures' or the specific 'telos' of the Isaiah passage.",
      "quotes": [
        "Man has no life in himself, it is Christ who is his life.",
        "Look to Jesus Christ. Look! Look!"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ground the Christocentric focus in the specific revelation of God in the text ('for I am God, and there is none else') rather than general evangelical tropes."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "At approximately 11.5 minutes, the sermon is far too short by Dekker's standard. It lacks the 'breadth' required for 'depth'. It is a brief exhortation rather than a substantive sermon.",
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must expand the exposition and application to at least 20 minutes to allow the text to truly speak in its complexity."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls significantly short of Dekker's criteria. It is primarily a biographical and psychological speech rather than an exposition of a specific Bible passage. It lacks linguistic depth (Hebrew/Greek), historical context, and the required length (under 12 minutes). The definition of salvation is reduced to psychological wholeness ('finding your key'), which obscures the radical nature of the Gospel.",
    "strengths": [
      "Clear focus on Christ as the source of salvation (Thesis 7).",
      "Effective use of narrative to engage the audience, even if the narratives displace the text."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Failure to provide any meaningful exegesis of the specific Isaiah passage (Thesis 1 & 2).",
      "Insufficient length to achieve theological depth (Thesis 8).",
      "Individualistic and psychological application that avoids the 'two ways' and the concrete 'zeitgeist' (Thesis 3 & 6)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is a spiritual address or a 'speech about the gospel' that uses a Bible passage as a pretext for storytelling. It lacks the formal rigor and substantive gravity required for the 'right proclamation of the Gospel'."
