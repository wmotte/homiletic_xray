        "score": 7,
        "score_explanation": "10 = Healthy, non-smothering care. The preacher is supportive but slightly borders on 'Rescuer' by generalizing gender strengths.",
        "presence": "High",
        "analysis": "The Nurturing Parent is strong, offering comfort to those who struggle with emotional expression. There is a risk of 'smothering' by suggesting everyone *should* connect on a heart level, but he acknowledges limitations (trauma/disability).",

      "presence": "Medium",
      "analysis": "The preacher addresses the listener as a thinking subject by citing 'research' about gender and stress. However, the Adult is sometimes sidelined by the Child's humor or the Parent's invitation to feel.",

        "presence_of_adaptation": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher speaks with a sense of internal freedom. He doesn't seem to be performing for a judgmental God or congregation, which reduces the AC pressure on the listeners.",

    "analysis": "The preacher alternates between a playful 'Free Child' (humor) and a 'Nurturing Parent' (invitation to emotional depth). He seeks a 'Heart-to-Heart' transaction, which in TA terms is FC to FC or NP to FC.",
    "ulterior_motives": "The 'Social' level is a Bible study on Peter; the 'Psychological' level is an invitation to emotional vulnerability ('Let me see your heart').",
    "communicative_purity_score": 8,
    "purity_explanation": "10 = Transparent. The preacher is very open about his goal: he wants people to move from 'head to heart'.",
    "risk_explanation": "The risk is a 'Rescuer' dynamic where the preacher assumes the congregation is 'stuck' in their heads and needs his intervention to 'feel'."

      "victim": "Low. Briefly mentions the difficulty of pastoring men who won't open up, but doesn't dwell on it."

    "congregation_position": "Pushed into the 'Victim' role (emotionally stunted) needing the 'Rescuer' (the preacher/the Spirit) to open them up.",
    "escape_possibilities": "The preacher offers an escape by validating those who *cannot* reach their heart, thereby granting autonomy and removing the 'must' of the Rescuer."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and promotes emotional intelligence. It successfully avoids the common 'Critical Parent' trap of many sermons. By using humor (Free Child) and empathy (Nurturing Parent), the preacher creates a safe space for reflection. The primary dynamic is an invitation to move from Adapted Child (compliance/performance) to Free Child (authentic emotion). While there is a slight 'Rescuer' tendency regarding emotional vulnerability, the preacher's explicit validation of those with emotional limitations (trauma/personality) prevents this from becoming a manipulative game.",
    "strengths": [
      "High use of Free Child creates rapport and safety.",
      "Strong Nurturing Parent provides comfort without excessive shame.",
      "Recognition of psychological barriers (trauma, EMDR) shows Adult reality-testing."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Heavy reliance on gender stereotypes (Adult ego could provide more nuance).",
      "The 'three times asking' technique could be perceived as intrusive/pestering if not handled carefully."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To remain game-free, ensure that the 'heart-connection' is presented as an invitation rather than a new 'spiritual law' that creates a new form of Adapted Child (the 'vulnerable' Christian)."
