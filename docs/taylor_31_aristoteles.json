  "aristotelian_modes_analysis": {
    "logos": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The rational architecture of the sermon is secondary to its emotional narrative. The preacher follows a simple inductive path: from the universal experience of death to the specific biblical narrative of Mary, ending with the theological resolution of the Resurrection. However, the sermon lacks rigorous exegetical depth. It relies on a 'mood' rather than a structured argument. The transition from the 'stubborn quality of love' to the theological necessity of the Resurrection is more poetic than logical. There is a lack of clear causal connection between the historical event of Easter and the contemporary application, relying instead on the repetition of the phrase 'Jesus has been here now' as a substitute for logical demonstration.",
      "quotes": [
        "If in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men most miserable",
        "Why ask such a question in a cemetery? ... An inept, cruel question, unless it is Jesus speaking.",
        "Faith declares that question to be not so strange on the first Easter morning, for Jesus was there in the cemetery and alive"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear thematic progression from the problem (death) to the solution (Resurrection).",
        "Effective use of a central question ('Why weepest thou?') as a hook.",
        "Consistent focus on the contrast between the 'cemetery' and 'Easter'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Strengthen the exegetical link between the text of John 20 and the philosophical claims about love.",
        "Clarify the logical transition between human 'stubborn love' and divine intervention.",
        "Provide more substantive theological grounding for the 'hope' mentioned beyond poetic sentiment."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Logos is sacrificed for Pathos; the sermon functions as a prose poem rather than a structured argument."
    },
    "pathos": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Pathos is the dominant and most effective mode in this sermon. The preacher excels at creating sensory-rich, emotionally resonant 'slices of life.' By describing the man in the hospital and the mother's love, the preacher bridges the gap between the biblical text and the hearer's existential reality. The language is highly evocative, appealing to the universal fear of loss and the longing for hope. The emotional arc is well-crafted, moving from the 'dark forebodings' of the grave to the 'glad anthems' of Easter. The use of contrast (laughter vs. frozen smiles, healing hands vs. cruel spikes) heightens the emotional stakes effectively.",
      "quotes": [
        "His eyes were sunken circles of sorrow and heartbreak. The sob in his soul shook his whole body.",
        "Laughter will be silenced, and smiles will be frozen. Death will enter...",
        "Hands that had touched the blind, healed the sick, and cleansed the leper were now frozen in the chill clutch of death."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Masterful use of imagery and sensory details to evoke empathy.",
        "Strong resonance with universal existential questions regarding death and grief.",
        "Effective variation in tone, moving from somber realism to hopeful celebration."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Reduce the reliance on sentimental adjectives to avoid the risk of emotional exhaustion.",
        "Ensure the emotional appeal leads to a specific theological response rather than just a feeling.",
        "Balance the 'dark' imagery with more concrete 'light' imagery to avoid a lopsided emotional weight."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Strong Pathos creates deep resonance, though it occasionally verges on the sentimental.",
      "emotional_tone": "Moves from profound sorrow and existential dread to triumphant hope and comfort."
    },
    "ethos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher establishes Ethos primarily through the role of a compassionate witness. By sharing the anecdote of the man in the hospital, the preacher demonstrates pastoral presence and empathy. However, the Ethos remains somewhat distant; the preacher speaks *about* the suffering of others rather than revealing their own vulnerability or struggle with the text. The authority is derived from the office and the shared cultural 'we,' but lacks the 'authority of the witness' who stands under the judgment of the message themselves. The language is polished and professional, which provides credibility but limits the sense of raw authenticity.",
      "quotes": [
        "I stood not too long ago with a man in a hospital room.",
        "I asked the man finally, 'How long have you two been married?'",
        "I do not say now what I am going to say in any flippant or critical sense but in admiration..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Demonstrates pastoral experience and empathy through concrete anecdotes.",
        "Maintains a tone of humility and respect when discussing human grief.",
        "Speaks with conviction regarding the central claims of the faith."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Incorporate more personal vulnerability regarding the preacher's own need for the Easter hope.",
        "Move from the 'distant observer' role to a 'fellow traveler' in the narrative.",
        "Avoid overly polished rhetoric that can create a barrier between the speaker and the message's urgency."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Credible pastoral Ethos, but lacks the depth of personal vulnerability found in exceptional preaching.",
      "authenticity": "Moderate; the preacher is a reliable narrator but maintains a professional distance."

  "rhetorical_balance_analysis": {
    "dominant_mode": "Pathos",
    "suppressed_mode": "Logos",
    "balance_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward Pathos, utilizing emotional resonance to carry the weight of the message. Logos is present but serves primarily as a frame for the emotional narrative. Ethos supports the Pathos by providing a pastoral context. While the sermon is effective in touching the heart, it provides little for the 'head' to grip onto in terms of theological or logical defense of the Resurrection. The balance is typical of occasional preaching (Easter), where the goal is to evoke a shared feeling of hope rather than to teach doctrine.",
    "consequences_of_imbalance": [
      "Hearers seeking intellectual grounding for their faith may find the sermon 'thin' or overly sentimental.",
      "The emotional high of the sermon may dissipate quickly because it is not anchored in a robust logical structure.",
      "The sermon reaches the 'heart' effectively but may bypass the 'mind' and the 'will' (orthopraxy)."
    ],
    "recommendation_for_balance": "Integrate more rigorous theological reflection on *why* the Resurrection changes the logic of the cemetery, moving beyond poetic assertion to logical demonstration."

    "orthodoxy_logos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is scripturally faithful in its conclusion but lacks depth in its handling of the biblical text, treating it more as a source for drama than doctrine."

    "orthopathy_pathos": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in awakening the 'right affections' of hope and comfort, aligning the hearer's emotional state with the joy of the Resurrection."

    "orthopraxy_ethos": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon focuses on 'feeling' and 'believing' but offers little in the way of 'doing' or how this hope transforms daily ethical living."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_rhetorical_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a rhetorically effective Easter sermon that prioritizes emotional resonance (Pathos) over logical structure (Logos). The preacher successfully captures the existential weight of death and the transformative potential of the Resurrection through vivid imagery and pastoral anecdotes. While the sermon is highly evocative and likely moved the original audience, it lacks the intellectual 'meat' that would provide a lasting logical foundation for the hope it proclaims. The Ethos is that of a sympathetic pastor, which lends credibility to the emotional appeals. Overall, it is a strong example of narrative-emotional preaching that fulfills its liturgical purpose but misses the opportunity for deeper theological instruction.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Vivid, sensory-rich imagery that makes the biblical narrative palpable.",
      "Strong emotional arc that moves effectively from despair to hope.",
      "Relatable human anecdotes that anchor the sermon in reality."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase the logical/theological depth to support the emotional claims.",
      "Reduce the use of repetitive, high-register poetic language.",
      "Include a clearer call to action or application (Orthopraxy)."
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Emotional-Narrative",
    "audience_analysis": "Most appealing to hearers experiencing grief or seeking emotional comfort; less appealing to those seeking intellectual or theological clarity.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Focus on a 'teaching' sermon that builds a logical case for a specific doctrine.",
      "Practice 'self-implication' by sharing a personal struggle with the text's demands.",
      "Use more varied sentence structures to avoid the 'prose-poem' monotony."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a classic example of Pathos-driven homiletics. It succeeds in its primary goal of creating an 'Easter experience' for the hearer. However, through the lens of the Aristotelian Triangle, it is imbalanced. The weakness in Logos prevents it from being a truly transformative 'whole-person' message. It is a 'good' sermon (6.5/10) that serves the heart well but leaves the head and hands somewhat neglected."
