    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of 'Prophetic Critical Parent' rhetoric. While the theological and political points may be valid, the psychological dynamic is heavily based on indignation and the Drama Triangle. It creates a strong 'In-Group' (the enlightened/oppressed) and 'Out-Group' (the pathological system), which can lead to a payoff of moral superiority rather than actual spiritual growth or autonomous action. The listener is moved to anger rather than reflection.",

Reduce the use of shaming language and invite the congregation into a space where they can process their own feelings of powerlessness without needing a Rescuer."
