    "sermon_start_end": "The Feast of the Epiphany on January 6 once had an alternative title. Pope Leo I (“Leo the Great”) referred to it in his Homilies not as Epiphaneia but as Theophania—a manifestation of God (theos). [...] You only, Christ, as Lord we own and with the Spirit, you alone share in the Father’s glory.",
    "notes": "The text functions as a hybrid between a theological essay and a liturgical sermon, heavily reliant on historical creeds and systematic theology."

  "aristotelian_modes_analysis": {
    "logos": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The rational architecture is exceptionally robust, functioning with the precision of a systematic theology lecture. The preacher establishes a clear linguistic foundation by distinguishing between 'kavod' (Hebrew) and 'doxa' (Greek), then moves logically from the Old Testament manifestations to the New Testament fulfillment in Christ. The argument follows a deductive path: defining the essence of glory, illustrating its biblical history, and concluding with its application to the believer. Transitions are seamless, and the use of historical markers (Chalcedon, Leo the Great, Westminster Catechism) provides a stable intellectual framework that supports the central thesis.",
      "quotes": [
        "In the biblical languages, the word for glory is kavod in Hebrew, doxa in Greek.",
        "Doxa is one step removed from God’s aseity. It is the radiant revelation of himself...",
        "The season of Epiphany offers an opportunity to focus for several weeks on the glory of Christ as the second person of the Trinity..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong etymological and linguistic grounding of key terms.",
        "Traceable historical-theological development from AD 451 to modern day.",
        "Clear thematic unity centered on the single word 'glory'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The sheer volume of citations (Barth, Lewis, Herbert, Catechisms) can occasionally obscure the primary biblical exegesis.",
        "The logical jumps between 'glory' and 'aseity' may be too abstract for a general lay audience.",
        "The transition from the 'inexpressible' nature of glory to the 'enjoyment' of it could benefit from a tighter logical bridge."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The sermon possesses a high degree of internal consistency and scholarly rigor, making the argument for Christ's divinity rationally compelling."
    },
    "pathos": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The emotional resonance is secondary to the intellectual content. While the preacher uses evocative words like 'shock and awe' or 'fear and trembling,' these are often described as concepts rather than evoked through narrative. The pathos is 'academic'—the hearer is told that Isaiah felt fear, but the sermon's language remains formal and detached. There is a lack of 'slices of life' or contemporary relatable struggle. The emotional tone is one of 'reverent distance,' which fits the subject of divine majesty but fails to bridge the gap to the hearer's immediate existential anxieties until the very end.",
      "quotes": [
        "Isaiah is completely overcome with fear and trembling. It is important for us to pause over this.",
        "Most of us don’t realize what we are singing when we toss off the familiar hymn...",
        "The glory of God comes upon Moses and Isaiah as a body blow."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of the 'burning bush' and 'Ezekiel's wheels' to create a sense of mystery.",
        "The connection of glory to the 'stench' of Lazarus's tomb provides a rare visceral moment.",
        "The use of poetry (George Herbert) adds a layer of affective beauty."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Reduce the reliance on 'telling' the audience how to feel (e.g., 'we should notice Isaiah’s reaction') and instead use more sensory imagery.",
        "The mention of Beyoncé feels like a forced contemporary 'hook' that doesn't fully integrate into the emotional arc.",
        "The sermon lacks a concrete human story of someone experiencing the 'glory' in a moment of modern suffering."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Pathos is underdeveloped; the sermon is intellectually moving but emotionally distant, prioritizing 'head-pathos' over 'heart-pathos'.",
      "emotional_tone": "Reverent, formal, and slightly cautionary (the 'Stand back!' motif)."
    },
    "ethos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher establishes authority as a 'teacher-scholar' rather than a 'witness-struggler.' The ethos is built on deep familiarity with the Great Tradition of the Church. However, there is very little personal vulnerability. The use of 'we' often feels like a collective liturgical 'we' rather than a personal admission of the preacher's own struggle with the 'semi-eclipse' of God's glory. The authority is derived from the office and the texts cited (Leo, Paul, Barth) rather than from a personal encounter with the Word. It is a 'credible teacher' ethos, which is stable but lacks the 'witness' power of personal testimony.",
      "quotes": [
        "We will approach the season of Epiphany... by focusing on just one word.",
        "Perhaps the very word glory seems bombastic to some...",
        "But, we might protest, we are not living wholeheartedly in this way."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "High degree of theological integrity and commitment to the text.",
        "Avoidance of self-promotion; the preacher stays behind the subject matter.",
        "A clear sense of pastoral concern for the 'body of Christ' and its current theological 'eclipse'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The preacher could share a personal moment where the 'glory of God' broke through their own 'unclean lips'.",
        "The tone is somewhat didactic; moving from 'lecturer' to 'fellow pilgrim' would increase credibility.",
        "Address the 'unbelievers' or 'troublesome' elements with more empathy and less clinical observation."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Ethos is grounded in academic and ecclesiastical authority, but lacks the vulnerability required for a deeply personal connection.",
      "authenticity": "The preacher is authentic in their conviction but remains shielded behind a mask of high-church scholarship."

  "rhetorical_balance_analysis": {
    "dominant_mode": "Logos",
    "suppressed_mode": "Pathos",
    "balance_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward Logos, functioning as a high-level theological exposition. Ethos supports this by positioning the preacher as a reliable guide through church history. Pathos is the weakest link, appearing mostly as a description of others' emotions (Isaiah, Moses, Paul) rather than an invitation for the congregation to feel. The balance is that of a 'teaching sermon'—it informs the mind excellently but may leave the heart largely un-pierced. The transition from the 'terror' of glory to the 'enjoyment' of glory is logically sound but emotionally abrupt.",
    "consequences_of_imbalance": [
      "Intellectually inclined hearers will be deeply satisfied; those seeking emotional comfort or personal connection may feel excluded.",
      "The sermon risks being remembered as a 'lesson' rather than an 'encounter'.",
      "The 'weight of glory' remains an abstract concept rather than a felt reality for the person in the pew."
    ],
    "recommendation_for_balance": "Integrate a modern narrative of 'glory in the midst of suffering' to ground the high Christology in human experience, thereby raising the Pathos score."

    "orthopathy_pathos": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "While it points toward 'right affections' (enjoyment of God), it describes them more than it awakens them."

      "analysis": "The preacher models a life of study and liturgical devotion, but the call to 'action' is primarily internal/dispositional."

  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_rhetorical_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a high-quality, intellectually rigorous sermon that excels in theological clarity and historical grounding. It successfully reclaims the concept of 'glory' from modern superficiality, placing it firmly back in its biblical and patristic context. The use of the 'Rhetorical Triangle' reveals a sermon that is strong in Logos but somewhat 'cold' in Pathos. It functions more as a theological treatise delivered from a pulpit than a transformative personal address. The preacher’s reliance on external authorities (C.S. Lewis, Karl Barth, George Herbert) bolsters the sermon’s intellectual weight but occasionally dilutes the directness of the kerygma. It is a 'safe' and 'orthodox' sermon that informs the congregation but may not move them to the 'fear and trembling' it so eloquently describes.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional clarity in defining complex theological terms (aseity, doxa, kavod).",
      "Seamless integration of Old and New Testament themes regarding the nature of God.",
      "Strong use of the liturgical year (Epiphany) as a structural framework."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase personal vulnerability to move from 'teacher' to 'witness'.",
      "Incorporate more sensory, narrative-driven illustrations to evoke Pathos.",
      "Simplify the academic jargon to ensure the 'glory' is accessible to all education levels."
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Rational-Declarative",
    "audience_analysis": "Most appealing to a well-educated, traditional congregation that values theological depth and liturgical continuity.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Start with a human story rather than a historical date.",
      "Use 'I' more often than 'one' or 'we' when discussing the impact of the text.",
      "Focus on one primary metaphor rather than a litany of theological citations."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a solid '7' in a homiletical context—it is far above average in its content and structure, but it lacks the rhetorical fire (Pathos) and personal transparency (Ethos) to reach the level of a truly transformative 'model' sermon. It is a successful piece of 'teaching' that fulfills its goal of theological recovery but stops short of being a visceral epiphany in its own right."
