  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon attempts to handle two distinct passages (2 Cor 13 and Psalm 130) rather than one specific pericope. This dilutes the specificity Dekker demands. While it identifies the 'depths' of Psalm 130 as the knowledge of being a 'miserable offender,' it leans heavily on liturgical tradition (Book of Common Prayer) rather than extracting what is unique to this text alone.",
      "quotes": [
        "The last four chapters of 2 Corinthians form the most agonized portion of the New Testament.",
        "The depth of which the psalmist is actually speaking here is the depth of the knowledge that he and everyone else is a 'miserable offender.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus exclusively on Psalm 130. Avoid using the 2 Corinthians text as a thematic bridge; instead, find the 'point that can be found nowhere else' within the specific mechanics of the Psalmist's cry."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is thin. There is no mention of the Hebrew context of 'De Profundis' or the specific cultic/historical situation of Israel. The preacher relies on a commentator and liturgical history rather than linguistic or historical-critical analysis of the text itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "One commentator called it almost too painful to read.",
        "Over the centuries, these 'depths' have been plumbed by countless sufferers..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the Hebrew nuances of 'waiting' (qavah) or 'forgiveness' (selichah) to show the specific theological weight of the original language as Dekker requires for a valid sermon."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is strong in its psychological imagery (the parent of a self-destructive child) but becomes more general when discussing the 'zeitgeist' of the prayer book changes. It successfully identifies a modern resistance to the concept of sin.",
      "quotes": [
        "Maybe he is hooked on drugs and failing in school, maybe she is anorexic and starving herself...",
        "The removal of this line has robbed us of a powerful buttress to the biblical concept of sin..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the 'liturgical wars' of the 1970s and apply the 'depths' to specific, contemporary cultural manifestations of 'self-will' and 'estrangement' in the present year."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured in two distinct halves (2 Cor then Psalm 130), which violates the movement Dekker seeks. Within the Psalm 130 section, however, there is a better blending of the text's logic with the hearer's reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is the movement of Psalm 130... It begins in the depths with unflinching acknowledgment..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Eliminate the 'double sermon' structure. Draw the hearer into the movement of the single text from the first sentence, rather than providing a thematic introduction followed by a second start."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon excels here. It takes 'misery' seriously, refusing to soften it. It correctly positions redemption as coming from outside the self (grace). The 'gratitude' is present in the 'fear of the Lord' as a response to mercy.",
      "quotes": [
        "...unflinching acknowledgment of the wretchedness of all humanity...",
        "The less we deserve, the more merit is in his bounty.",
        "The fear of the Lord arises out of the discovery that he is a God of infinite mercy..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'gratitude' part is more explicitly linked to the 'watchman' imagery of the text to show how redemption leads to a new way of living."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon addresses the 'impulse toward self-destruction' and the 'vast primordial catastrophe.' It takes the possibility of being 'lost' seriously, though it focuses more on the state of being lost than the decision/path leading there.",
      "quotes": [
        "...redeem his entire creation from its impulse toward self-destruction.",
        "Not the man who is lost, but the man who is about to be saved can understand that he is a sinner."

      "improvement_point": "Make the 'two ways' more concrete: what does the 'broad way' look like in the congregation's life today compared to the 'narrow way' of waiting for the Lord?"

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "While the first half is Trinitarian, Christ is largely absent from the exposition of Psalm 130 until the closing prayer. Christ is a 'theme' in the first part but not the clear 'telos' of the specific Psalm exposition.",
      "quotes": [
        "God’s love spends itself to the very last drop of the blood of the Son.",
        "through Jesus Christ our Lord..."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 14-15 minutes (1450 words), the sermon fails Dekker’s 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for true 'depth.'",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical work and the contemporary cultural analysis to reach the 20-minute threshold. Depth requires more time than this text allows."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily due to its fragmented focus on two different Bible passages and its insufficient length. It functions more as a thematic reflection on 'Grace and Sin' than a rigorous exposition of a specific pericope. However, it is strong in its refusal to sentimentalize human misery and its insistence on the necessity of external redemption.",
    "strengths": [
      "Theological sobriety regarding the doctrine of sin ('miserable offenders').",
      "Effective use of psychological imagery to illustrate the 'depths' of parental/divine love.",
      "Clear articulation of the 'fear of the Lord' as a response to forgiveness."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Failure to adhere to the 20-minute rule, resulting in a lack of exegetical 'breadth'.",
      "Lack of specific linguistic/historical exegesis (Hebrew/Greek).",
      "Structural fragmentation by treating two texts instead of one specific passage."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate homiletical reflection, but it is not yet a 'sermon' by Dekker's strict formal definition. It lacks the specific exegetical depth and the necessary length to properly 'expound and apply' the Word."
