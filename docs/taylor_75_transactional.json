    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "While theologically orthodox in its use of scripture, the sermon is psychologically coercive. It utilizes a sharp 'Switch' from a Nurturing Parent to a Critical Parent/Persecutor. By labeling congregants as 'partners of hell,' the preacher bypasses Adult reflection and moves straight into shaming. The final section attempts to 'Rescue' the listener, but the emotional whiplash likely leaves the listener in a state of 'Adapted Child' compliance rather than 'Adult' autonomy.",

      "The sudden shift to name-calling (gossipmongers) is a 'crossed transaction' that shuts down Adult listening.",
      "Over-reliance on the Drama Triangle (Satan as Persecutor, God as Rescuer, Human as helpless Victim)."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Address the issue of gossip from the Adult ego state. Instead of 'I name you partners of hell,' try 'We often struggle with how we speak about one another; let's look at the impact of our words.' This invites the listener to think rather than react from fear."
