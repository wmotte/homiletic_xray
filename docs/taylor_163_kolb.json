    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a strong concrete experience through a travel narrative. It effectively bridges the gap between a physical journey and a spiritual one. However, the transition from the Mississippi River to Gethsemane is somewhat abrupt, relying on a metaphorical link rather than a shared emotional state. The preacher successfully evokes the physical setting of the garden and the emotional weight of loneliness, allowing the hearer to 'feel' the gnarled trees and the chill night.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Reflective observation is present but tends to move quickly toward theological conclusions. The preacher pauses to ask 'why' the disciples failed and 'why' Jesus needed them, but the analysis of the human condition remains somewhat individualistic. It explores the 'problem' of loneliness and the need for human presence effectively, though it lacks a broader cultural or social critique of why we struggle to 'watch' with others today.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The theological framework is traditional and clear. The 'big idea' is that private victory in prayer precedes public victory in life. However, the exegesis is more descriptive than analytical. The sermon stays on the surface of the 'substitutionary' aspects of Calvary without deeply exploring the theological mechanics of the 'cup' or the 'will' beyond a simple surrender. The logical connection between the Mississippi's source and Gethsemane serves as the primary conceptual scaffold.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon's application is the weakest phase. While it challenges the hearer to 'watch' and 'be regular in worship,' these calls feel like a 'moralistic tail' added to the end of the biblical narrative. The transition from Jesus' agony to the congregation's giving habits and church attendance is jarring and lacks the 'how-to' depth required for true active experimentation. It tells the hearer *what* to do but not *how* to develop the inner life that makes such actions possible.",
      "quotes": [

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of narrative-visionary preaching that successfully engages the hearer's imagination and emotions. It fails, however, to provide a robust bridge between the profound spiritual agony of Gethsemane and the mundane practicalities of congregational life. The opening illustration is effective but perhaps too long, and the theological 'big idea'—that private prayer is the source of public victory—is clear but could be more deeply explored. The preacher excels at creating a 'mood' and facilitating empathy with the biblical characters, but the transition to application feels like a missed opportunity to invite the hearer into a deeper, more specific spiritual practice. The sermon addresses the 'Diverging' and 'Accommodating' learning styles well but leaves the 'Converging' learner with somewhat superficial tasks.",

      "Ensure the 'Concrete Experience' in the introduction more closely mirrors the emotional 'Concrete Experience' of the biblical text."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a well-crafted piece of homiletical art that prioritizes the 'Visionary' and 'Narrative' quadrants of the Homiletic Window. It succeeds in making the biblical story feel present and emotionally urgent. From a Kolb perspective, it completes the cycle but with uneven energy; the 'Active Experimentation' phase lacks the weight of the 'Concrete Experience.' The priority for improvement is to develop applications that flow more naturally from the theological and emotional depths explored in the sermon's body, moving beyond institutional maintenance (attendance/giving) toward transformative spiritual practice."
