    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exemplary model of psychologically healthy homiletics. It avoids the common trap of the 'Religious Persecutor' by grounding the critique of suicide in theology rather than moralism. By utilizing the Adult ego state, the preacher respects the autonomy of the listener. The inclusion of the personal narrative about 'Mary V.' provides a Free Child experience of grace that bypasses the Adapted Child's need for rules, offering instead a 'new spirit.' It promotes autonomy by emphasizing that the 'final exit' (death to self-will) has already occurred in baptism, freeing the individual from the burden of self-justification.",

      "The transition from praising Stoic 'nobility' to calling it 'disastrous' could be perceived as a slight 'Bait and Switch' for a sensitive listener."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name the limitations of the pulpit; it prevents the ITHY game. Maintain the distinction between 'moral fault' and 'theological perspective' to keep the Critical Parent in check."
