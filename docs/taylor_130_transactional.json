    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is rhetorically powerful but psychologically regressive. It heavily utilizes the Nurturing Parent ego state to offer a 'Rescuer' theology that may foster dependency rather than spiritual maturity. By promising that Christ will 'put food on your table' and 'make friends for you,' the preacher risks setting up a 'False Promise' game. The shift from Adult scholarly discourse to Critical Parent rebukes regarding belief creates a confusing transactional environment for the listener.",
    "strengths": [

      "Engages the Adult ego state initially with historical and scholarly context."

      "Over-reliance on the Rescuer role in the Drama Triangle.",
      "Use of 'must' and shaming language regarding the congregation's internal state (unbelief)."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to maintain the Adult-Adult transaction when inviting response. Instead of telling the congregation they 'do not believe,' ask them to reflect on what hinders their belief. Avoid promising material payoffs (food, clothing) for spiritual transactions, as this triggers 'Gimmick' dynamics."
