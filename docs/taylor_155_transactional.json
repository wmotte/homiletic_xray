    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically supportive and largely avoids toxic shame. It operates primarily through a Nurturing Parent to Child transaction, aiming to provide emotional regulation and hope to a congregation likely facing external pressures. While it risks 'bypassing' Adult reality (politics, the mechanics of change) in favor of spiritual triumph, its lack of coercive 'Critical Parent' energy makes it a healthy example of traditional homiletics.",
    "strengths": [
      "High transparency regarding the preacher's own humanity.",
      "Strong Free Child energy that invites the listener into joy rather than fear.",
      "Avoidance of 'NIGYSOB' games; the preacher does not hunt for the listener's sins."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on the Nurturing Parent can keep the congregation in a dependent Child state.",
      "Dismissal of Adult 'data' (politics, 'how and where') can lead to a passive faith."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Incorporate more Adult-to-Adult transactions by asking the congregation how the 'power of the resurrection' might practically inform their choices in the 'politics' you mentioned, rather than just waiting for God to resolve it."
