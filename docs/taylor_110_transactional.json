  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely avoids manipulative 'Games'. It operates primarily from a Nurturing Parent position that seeks to empower the Free Child of the listener through hope and identity. While it flirts with a 'Rescuer' dynamic regarding the political climate, it anchors its authority in the 'Adult' processing of historical documents and scripture. The impact is one of integration—bringing the 'splendor and the squalor' together rather than splitting them.",
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of humor to de-escalate denominational tension.",
      "Authentic connection to historical trauma without staying stuck in a 'Victim' loop.",
      "Strong Adult-Adult engagement with the text of the Declaration and the Preamble."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Camelot' imagery risks creating a 'Rescuer' fantasy around political figures.",
      "The definition of 'treason' is a Critical Parent move that could stifle honest Adult dissent."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To remain game-free, ensure that the 'hope' offered is not dependent on a specific political administration (Rescuer), but remains rooted in the Adult reality of the 'creatureliness' mentioned in the sermon."
