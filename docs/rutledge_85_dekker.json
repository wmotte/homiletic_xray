    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on a single specific passage. It treats the Bible as a collection of themes (prophetic tradition) rather than a specific word. It uses four different books, violating Dekker's rule that a sermon is not about 'the prophet Elijah' or a keyword, but a specific pericope.",

        "When the lectionary readings for a given Sunday bring the prophet Ezekiel together with an American national holiday..."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is a basic understanding of the prophetic office (authorized speech, reluctance), but it remains at the level of general biblical theology. There is no evidence of linguistic study or deep historical-critical engagement with the specific contexts of Ezekiel vs. Zephaniah.",

        "The Hebrew prophets were a unique breed... authorized to speak, not only in God’s name but in his very words."

      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part. It is concrete, naming specific social ills in New York and the church's own shelter. It avoids vague 'be kind' language by addressing the 'national disgrace' of poverty.",

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured as a topical lecture. It begins with a long secular introduction (Declaration of Independence), moves to a general biblical section, and then to social commentary. The 'present of revelation' where text and hearer merge is hindered by the thematic structure.",
      "quotes": [
        "All these things and more need to be said at the outset..."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on the 'two ways' through the lens of national accountability and the 'Day of the Lord'. It warns of being a 'rebellious house'. However, it leans heavily toward 'temporal loss' (social decay) rather than the eternal dimension Dekker emphasizes.",
      "quotes": [

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 18.5 minutes, the sermon falls just short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. While it covers much ground, it lacks the 'breadth' of deep textual dwelling because it jumps between too many passages.",
      "improvement_point": "Increase the duration by slowing down the exposition of a single text to find its 'depth'."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's definition primarily because it is a thematic speech on 'prophecy and patriotism' rather than an exposition of a specific Bible passage. It relies heavily on a secular document (Declaration of Independence) for its opening and treats the Bible as a source for general truths about social justice. While the application is commendably concrete and the tone is appropriately serious, the lack of a single scriptural anchor prevents it from becoming a 'new, current, proclamatory word' of God.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application to the local context (New York, Grace Church shelter).",
      "Serious engagement with the 'misery' of the current zeitgeist.",
      "Rejection of 'general truths' in favor of specific social accountability."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Violation of Thesis 1.3: uses multiple passages to support a theme rather than one specific text.",
      "Insufficient Christological focus; Christ is a concluding figure rather than the telos.",
      "Length is below the threshold for necessary depth."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate religious address or a 'prophetic speech', but according to Dekker's strict criteria, it is not a sermon because it lacks a specific biblical anchor and fails the 20-minute depth requirement."
