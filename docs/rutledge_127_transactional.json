Instead of 'I'm Only Trying to Help You,' the preacher admits she is 'bent and crippled by sin' like the listeners.

    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative games. By speaking from a strong Adult ego position, Rutledge validates the listener's intellectual and existential struggles. She avoids the common homiletical trap of the 'Nurturing Parent' who smothers the congregation with easy answers, or the 'Critical Parent' who shames them for doubt. Instead, she models 'Integrated Adult' behavior: acknowledging the 'terrible' reality of life and God while maintaining a commitment to faith. The use of the 'Physics Professor' anecdote sets an Adult-Adult tone from the outset, signaling that this is a space for thinking subjects.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of transparency and vulnerability.",
      "Validation of the listener's reality (intellectual doubt and the problem of evil).",
      "Avoidance of the Drama Triangle; the preacher does not play the Rescuer."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The heavy emphasis on 'fear' and 'terror' could potentially trigger an Adapted Child response in more sensitive listeners if not balanced by the 'touch of Jesus' mentioned in the text."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I-statements' regarding faith and doubt. Maintain the balance of acknowledging the 'Cloud' (hiddenness) which prevents the sermon from becoming a 'Con' for a simple life."
