    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes concrete imagery, particularly in the introduction regarding the 'impact of a little one' and the 'broad back of America.' However, as the sermon progresses into the exegetical core, the imagery becomes more conventional. The preacher effectively 'paints' the 1980s office scene to illustrate cultural distance, which serves as a strong aesthetic bridge to the biblical 'strangeness.' Yet, the central metaphors of the 'new cloth' and 'wineskins' are explained rather than vividly evoked. The imagery of the 'wedding feast' remains somewhat abstract—it is spoken about as a concept more than it is felt as a sensory reality. The 'stench of the pigsty' or the 'taste of the wine' is missing, leaving the imagery at a cognitive level rather than a fully immersive sensory experience.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Leans toward 'telling'. While the 1980s illustration 'shows', the theological application 'tells' the congregation that it is a feast without always making them feel the festivity."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is accessible and avoids heavy 'Canaanite' jargon, which aligns with McEntyre’s stewardship of language. However, there is a frequent use of filler phrases ('om het zo te zeggen', 'zeg maar', 'nou ja') and repetitive markers ('dat merk je dan ook', 'en dan zie je'). This creates a somewhat informal, almost chatty atmosphere that occasionally detracts from the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed tradition. The precision is highest when discussing the 'tobberigheid' (worry/brooding) of the Dutch Reformed character, where the preacher accurately names a specific cultural-religious mood. The theological terms like 'Koninkrijk' and 'verbond' are integrated naturally but lack poetic sharpening.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a conversational cadence, which is effective for a 'performance' (Immink), but it lacks the rhythmic elevation associated with high homiletic aesthetics. The sentence structures are often long and additive ('En... en...'), which works for oral delivery but can become monotonous. There are few rhetorical figures like parallelism or alliteration that would make the message 'stick' (musicality). The rhythm is that of a teacher or a witness in conversation, rather than a herald or a poet. The 'mompel, mompel' section provides a rare and effective rhythmic break that mimics the scene's tension, but such moments are scarce.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 5.67,
    "summary_language": "The language is functional, accessible, and grounded in the 'here and now.' It excels in creating a bridge between the 2026 context and the biblical text through relatable illustrations. However, it lacks the 'poetic power' described by Grözinger. The imagery is often explained rather than experienced, and the rhythm remains at a conversational level. It is a 'stewardship of language' that prioritizes clarity over beauty, which fits the 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic but misses opportunities for deeper sensory impact."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear, albeit somewhat traditional, two-point structure (Presence vs. Absence). The 'upsetting of the equilibrium' is well-handled in the introduction by discussing how a child 'turns life upside down.' This creates an immediate 'plot' of change. The movement through the five conflict scenes in Mark 2 provides a sense of mounting tension. However, the 'turning point' is more conceptual than dramatic; the transition from the 'old world' to the 'new world' is discussed as a theological fact rather than a dramatic resolution. The energy remains consistent but doesn't peak, leading to a conclusion that feels more like a 'moral exhortation' than a 'narrative resolution'.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong point of the sermon. The preacher successfully 'reframes' (Cilliers) the biblical conflict between old and new by using the 1980s office analogy and the 2026 geopolitical/AI shifts. The 'strangeness' of the Gospel is made palpable by comparing it to the 'brutality' of a modern person in a past era. The synthesis between the 'wineskins' and the 'resistance' in our own hearts (secularization, targets at work) feels organic. The sermon honors the 'then' of the text while making it a 'now' event (Immink). It avoids the pitfall of using the text merely as a springboard, keeping the exegesis of Mark 2 central to the contemporary application.",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with significant openness, acknowledging the 'ambivalence of existence' and the 'discomfort' of change. However, as it reaches the conclusion, it becomes increasingly 'closed' (Stark). The final section moves into a prescriptive, almost moralistic tone regarding church attendance and the use of sacraments ('zou ik ons bijna vermanen', 'is het werkelijk nodig om daar te zijn'). While theologically consistent with the tradition, aesthetically it 'seals' the work of art by telling the hearer exactly what to do, rather than leaving the 'Space for Grace' open for the Spirit to move. The 'polyvalence' of the wedding feast is narrowed down to 'coming to church on Sunday'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wat verwachten de meeste mensen vandaag de dag voor voorbij het sterven? Voel jij het niet, gedoopt als je bent?",
        "En wat dat betreft zou ik ons bijna vermanen... dat rond het Avondmaal een sfeer van tobberigheid kan hangen.",

    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is solid and well-integrated. The preacher successfully bridges the gap between the biblical world and the complex reality of 2026. The narrative arc is functional, though it relies on a traditional 'two-point' scaffold. The sermon's greatest strength is its 'reframing' of the Gospel as a disruptive 'new world.' Its greatest weakness is the 'closed' ending, where the aesthetic 'Space for Grace' is somewhat constricted by moralizing exhortations about church attendance, shifting the focus from God's action to human duty."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids religious kitsch. It does not offer 'cheap comfort' or 'happy endings' without acknowledging the 'pain of suffering' (Cilliers). By explicitly naming the 'tobberigheid' and the 'resistance' in the heart, the preacher avoids the 'pretense of feelings that are not there.' The mention of 'rustig kunnen sterven' (dying peacefully) is handled with authentic gravity rather than sentimentalism. However, the 'wedding feast' imagery occasionally flirts with cliché, but it is saved by the counter-weight of the 'weggenomen' (taken away) Bridegroom and the 'broken wineskins.' The emotion feels authentic because it is rooted in the struggle of living between two worlds.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The somewhat generic 'feestvreugde' (joy of the feast) which isn't always grounded in the specific 'trouble' of the text.",
      "The 'happy' description of the 'first love' in the desert, which glosses over the biblical reality of Israel's murmuring."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The honest admission of the 'discomfort' modern Christians feel in a secular world.",
      "The description of the 'targets' and 'hier en nu' (here and now) that distract from the Kingdom."

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is opened by the central theme: the Bridegroom is present regardless of our 'tobberigheid.' This is a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) that de-centers the human actor. The sermon effectively argues that grace is a 'new world' breaking in. However, the space is partially closed by the 'moralization' in the final third. When the preacher shifts from 'Christ is present' to 'we must be in church,' the 'vertical dimension' of the gift risks being overshadowed by the 'horizontal dimension' of the task. The mystery of the sacraments is well-defended but perhaps too 'neatly' explained.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'already' and 'not yet' is sustained well until the very end, where it is resolved into a call for church attendance.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of Christ's presence in the Spirit is respected, though the 'wineskin' metaphor is decoded quite rapidly.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the first two-thirds; moralization takes the lead in the final third.",
    "recommendation": "Let the 'presence of the Bridegroom' be the final word. Instead of 'we must be there,' conclude with 'He is there, waiting for you'—shifting the focus back to the Divine Actor."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that is highly effective in its 'reframing' of contemporary life. It avoids the 'visual excess' of kitsch and focuses on the 'beauty of simplicity.' The preacher's use of a 2026 context (AI, geopolitical shifts) creates a sharp, relevant 'optics' for the congregation. The aesthetic quality is strongest in Domain B (Integration), where the biblical 'new wine' is convincingly mapped onto the 'discomfort' of modern change. However, the sermon is aesthetically limited by its 'paper language' and its tendency to 'tell' rather than 'show.' The transition from a narrative 'open work' to a moralistic 'closed' conclusion reduces the overall aesthetic impact. It is a solid, functional sermon that 'meets' the requirements of practical theology but stops short of 'aesthetic excellence' due to its conversational flatness and final moralization.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Excellent 'reframing' of the biblical text through the 1980s/2026 analogy.",
      "Authentic naming of the 'tobberig' Reformed subculture, avoiding religious kitsch.",

      "Increase 'imagery' by using more sensory, 'cinematic' language (Wilson).",

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Reframing-Analytical",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Four Pages/Imagery).",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who value intellectual clarity and contemporary relevance over emotional or poetic 'highs'. It appeals to the 'modern believer' struggling with secularization.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves a question for the hearer to carry home.",
      "Practice 'Show, Don't Tell'—describe the 'new wine' until the congregation can almost taste it.",
      "Vary the sentence structure to create a more 'performative' rhythm."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a well-crafted example of 'practical-theological' preaching that takes the 'aesthetic turn' seriously through its focus on perception and reframing. It successfully avoids the kitsch of easy answers while maintaining a firm Reformed identity. While it lacks the poetic elevation of a 'work of art' in the strictest sense, it functions as a powerful 'witness' (Long) to the presence of the Bridegroom in a shifting world. Its aesthetic score is held back by a functional linguistic style and a prescriptive conclusion, but its 'reframing' of the 2026 context is a model of homiletic integration."
