    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is rhetorically beautiful but psychologically regressive. It heavily utilizes the 'Critical Parent' to induce 'holy dread' (Adapted Child) as a prerequisite for grace. By defining the listener as fundamentally 'deficient in love' and 'puffed up,' it creates a dependency on the 'Rescuer' (God/Preacher). The use of the crack addict metaphor reinforces a 'Victim' position for the listener, where growth or 'turning oneself around' is framed as secondary to passive reception. This risks creating a cycle of guilt and relief rather than Adult spiritual maturity.",

      "Promotion of 'Victim' passivity in the Drama Triangle."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Invite the listener's Adult ego. Instead of telling them they are 'puffed up' (Parent), ask them to reflect on their own experiences of pride (Adult). Shift from 'Rescuing' the listener to 'Empowering' them to respond to grace with Adult responsibility."
