      "rescuer": "Low. He does not offer to save the congregation from their guilt; he points to Grace as an external reality.",

    "congregation_position": "The congregation is invited into the role of 'Searcher' or 'Witness' rather than Victim.",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a model of psychologically healthy homiletics. It operates almost entirely from the Adult ego state, utilizing historical data and logical frameworks to address highly emotional and potentially manipulative topics (guilt, rejection, chosenness). By modeling lament (NP) rather than judgment (CP), the preacher creates a safe space for the listener to process difficult history without falling into the Drama Triangle. The use of the 'Robinson Crusoe' metaphor engages the Free Child's sense of wonder, providing a positive payoff that is authentic rather than coerced.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "Avoidance of shaming/coercion despite the heavy subject of the Holocaust.",
      "Transparent use of personal emotion (lament) as a bridge to the text."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'damned for the glory of God' section could risk triggering Adapted Child fear in less biblically-literate listeners if not carefully contextualized.",
      "Slight risk of 'Ain't It Awful' regarding the 'attenuated' American tradition, though it is balanced by the 'Good News' conclusion."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' and 'us' to maintain the NP/Adult position. Ensure that the 'sorrow' expressed remains a shared lament rather than a tool to induce guilt in the listener."
