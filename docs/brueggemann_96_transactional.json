However, it relies heavily on a Parent-Child dynamic, framing the Christian life as a response to a 'demanding' Parent God. It risks fostering a 'we-vs-them' mentality (Ain't It Awful) which provides a payoff of moral superiority while keeping the congregation in a state of 'fragile' dependency on the preacher's interpretation of systemic evil.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try moving from 'The summons is...' (Parent) to 'How do we choose to respond to...' (Adult). Invite the Free Child by exploring the 'joy' of faith without tethering it immediately to 'discipline' and 'commandments'."
