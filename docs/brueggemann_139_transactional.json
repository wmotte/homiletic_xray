  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust, primarily operating from an Adult ego state. It avoids the common 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' trap by refusing to provide easy answers. Instead, it uses the Passion narrative to provoke reality-testing in the listener. While it utilizes Critical Parent language to address systemic injustice, it does so to invite the listener into a responsible Adult decision rather than to induce Adapted Child submission. The impact is one of empowerment through responsibility.",
    "strengths": [
      "High Adult engagement.",
      "Avoids emotional manipulation or 'guilt-tripping' for personal failings.",
      "Models a 'Free Child' stance toward oppressive structures."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The Critical Parent labels (e.g., 'white power') may trigger a 'Crossed Transaction' (Rebellion) in listeners who feel attacked.",
      "The distinction between the 'Social' and 'Psychological' kingdom could be clearer to avoid confusing the Adult."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To remain game-free, ensure the 'Critical Parent' judgments of the world are always tied back to 'Adult' evidence, allowing the listener to reach the conclusion themselves rather than feeling 'NIGYSOB' (Now I've Got You...) regarding their political views."
