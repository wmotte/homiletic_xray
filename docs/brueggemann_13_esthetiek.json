    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating a dominant, recurring metaphor: 'frozen assets' versus 'surging power.' This imagery is not merely decorative but serves as a cognitive frame for the entire message. Brueggemann (or the preacher) uses sensory-rich language to describe the 'stench' of the status quo and the 'leaping, dancing' of the new reality. The imagery of the 'tea party' being upset provides a sharp, domestic contrast to the cosmic 'surging power.' By utilizing Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' principle, the preacher paints the scene of the lame man not as a dry miracle, but as a violation of 'controlling categories.' The imagery is living and provocative, successfully avoiding the 'dead metaphors' of traditional dogmatics.",
      "quotes": [
        "power operates largely to close things down and keep all the assets frozen.",
        "We are threatened, because we do not want our tea party upset.",
        "like the lame man, jumping up, leaping, singing, and praising God."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Consistent and evocative use of the 'frozen assets' metaphor.",
        "Strong sensory verbs (surging, unsettling, revamps, shatters).",
        "Effective contrast between domestic stability (tea party) and divine disruption."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Some metaphors like 'frozen assets' are repeated frequently; a secondary image could provide more texture.",
        "The 'swords to plowshares' quote is a standard biblical image; a more contemporary equivalent would sharpen the impact.",
        "The description of the 'failed places' could benefit from even more concrete, localized detail."

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strongly favors 'showing' by describing the physical and social effects of power rather than just defining 'resurrection' abstractly."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise and avoids 'Canaanite' jargon. Instead of using 'sanctification' or 'justification,' the preacher speaks of 'crossing lines' and 'violating categories.' There is a clear stewardship of language in the way 'annoyance' is analyzed—not as a minor emotion, but as a systemic resistance to newness. However, the use of 'socioeconomic' and 'political' late in the sermon leans slightly toward academic prose, though it remains grounded in the narrative. The word choice is economical; every sentence feels intentional, reflecting Marilyn Chandler McEntyre's call for precision as a form of truth-telling.",
      "quotes": [
        "The God of the Bible is an inscrutable power for life released in the world.",
        "They were 'much annoyed,' not curious, not baffled, but upset.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition to 'socioeconomic' feels slightly more like a lecture than the preceding narrative.",
        "The phrase 'failed places' is effective but could be specified to avoid becoming a catch-all platitude.",
        "The use of 'assets' is clever but risks being overly tied to a single economic register."

      "jargon_analysis": "Religious jargon is almost entirely absent; theological concepts are 'reframed' in sociological and phenomenological terms."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a rhythmic cadence reminiscent of Hebrew poetry. The use of lists ('unsettles and revamps and opens and jeopardizes and heals') creates a cumulative effect that mimics the 'surging power' being described. There is a sophisticated variation in sentence length—short, declarative statements ('And he did!') are followed by longer, flowing reflections. The repetition of 'prefer the old...' creates a liturgical staccato that builds tension. This is clearly 'oral language' designed to be heard; it has the 'flow' that Gerrit Immink associates with the performative 'event' of preaching.",
      "quotes": [
        "unsettles and revamps and opens and jeopardizes and heals.",
        "If you’re dead, you’re dead, and will stay so.",
        "No more frightened hearts, but hearts alive, bodies restored, communities, families, the world..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent use of polysyndeton (repetition of 'and') to create a sense of abundance.",
        "Rhythmic parallelism in the 'prefer the old...' section.",
        "Variation between staccato action and legato reflection."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The middle section (the Acts commentary) becomes slightly more prose-heavy and loses some of the initial poetic drive.",
        "The transition between the four numbered points in section II could be more fluidly integrated into the rhythm.",
        "The conclusion could benefit from a more distinct rhythmic 'crescendo' before the final sentence."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Decidedly oral language; the rhythm and repetition are optimized for the ear, not the eye."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high level of micro-aesthetic quality. It avoids the 'Canaanite' dialect of traditional piety, opting instead for a 'stewardship of language' that is both precise and poetic. The dominant metaphor of 'frozen assets' provides a cohesive visual frame, while the rhythmic, repetitive sentence structures create a sense of movement and urgency. It successfully 'shows' the power of the resurrection through concrete descriptions of social and personal transformation, making the abstract 'holy' happen through the aesthetic power of the word."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with the bleak reality of a 'frozen' world. The tension is maintained through the conflict between the 'new power' and the 'annoyed authorities.' The movement from the 'lame man' (individual) to 'nations' (global) expands the scope effectively. However, the numbered list in the middle (1, 2, 3, 4) slightly interrupts the narrative flow, making it feel more like a commentary than a single, seamless journey. The resolution is strong, inviting the hearer into the 'leaping' of the lame man, though the ending is perhaps a bit more 'settled' than a truly 'open' work of art might be.",
      "quotes": [
        "Everything is arranged and settled and fixed and closed...",
        "The reason they were annoyed is that the news of resurrection is unsettling.",
        "It could be us!"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong opening that identifies a universal human condition (despair/complacency).",
        "Clear turning point where the 'newness' of Acts confronts the 'annoyance' of the world.",
        "Effective expansion of the 'plot' from a biblical story to the hearer's reality."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The explicit numbering (1, 2, 3, 4) breaks the 'spell' of the narrative arc.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a masterclass in Cilliers' 'reframing.' The preacher takes the 'strangeness' of the Acts narrative and uses it to reframe contemporary socio-political paralysis. The connection between the 'lame man' and 'frozen assets' is surprising yet feels organic. The sermon does not 'smooth over' the text; it respects the 'annoyance' of the authorities, which mirrors the modern resistance to change. It successfully moves between the 'then' of Jerusalem and the 'now' of 'failed families' and 'warring nations' without being forced. The biblical text is not a springboard but the lens through which reality is seen anew.",
      "quotes": [
        "Easter is not just an ancient oddity. Easter is rather an unsettling way in the world...",
        "The authorities ever since Pharaoh... have recognized that a dangerous power is on the loose.",
        "Our old habits of deathliness now are emptied of authority..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Authentic 'reframing' of the resurrection as a public, socio-economic event.",
        "Organic link between the biblical 'annoyance' and contemporary 'complacency'.",
        "Respect for the 'strangeness' of the divine power."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The mention of 'swords to plowshares' feels a bit like a 'biblical reflex' rather than a fresh contextual integration.",
        "More specific contemporary 'frozen assets' (e.g., specific social issues) could sharpen the 'reframing'.",
        "The link between 'silver and gold' and 'frozen assets' could be more explicitly drawn."

      "reframing_present": "Strongly present; it offers a new frame (surging power) to replace the old frame (frozen assets)."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is polyvalent in its application, touching on families, churches, and nations. However, it leans toward a 'closed' structure in its rhetorical force. The preacher 'announces' and 'asserts' with high authority. While it acknowledges the 'riddle' and 'mystery,' the conclusion is quite prescriptive: 'You can be on the side of the newness.' It lacks the 'open ending' or the 'lingering question' that Ciska Stark advocates for in an 'Opera Aperta.' The hearer is invited, but the path is very clearly paved. It honors the 'ambivalence of existence' in the beginning but resolves it quite decisively by the end.",
      "quotes": [
        "This power, I announce to you, is unloosed in the world.",
        "The Easter question for us is... whether you can permit in your horizon new healing power.",
        "It could be us!"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the difficulty of 'getting your mind around' the resurrection.",
        "Leaves room for the hearer to identify their own 'failed places'.",
        "The 'It could be us!' ending is an invitation rather than a command."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The rhetorical tone is occasionally 'coercive' in its certainty.",
        "More room for the 'resistance' of the hearer could be acknowledged within the sermon's own logic.",
        "Ending with a question might have better served the 'open work' aesthetic."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent; the preacher's interpretation is dominant, though the application is broad."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is strong, characterized by a clear narrative movement from 'frozen' despair to 'surging' hope. The integration of text and context is the sermon's greatest structural strength, successfully 'reframing' the resurrection as a contemporary reality. While the use of a numbered list in the middle slightly detracts from the narrative flow, the overall arc remains compelling. The sermon is more 'closed' than 'open,' favoring a prophetic announcement over an interpretive invitation, but it remains aesthetically engaging through its dramatic tension."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully avoids religious kitsch. It does not offer 'immediate comfort' or 'pre-chewed emotions.' Instead, it takes the 'pain of suffering' and the 'annoyance' of reality seriously. There is no 'happy ending' that ignores the 'savage, unproductive hostility' of the world. The preacher avoids the cliché of 'Jesus is the answer' by describing the resurrection as a 'dangerous restlessness' and a 'threat.' This is authentic aesthetic depth because it sustains the tension between the 'already' and the 'not yet.' The emotion feels authentic because it is rooted in the 'crisis' of Easter rather than sentimental piety.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'swords to plowshares' section borders on a clichéd 'happy ending' vision, though it is framed as a 'poetic' possibility.",
      "The phrase 'hearts alive, bodies restored' could be seen as slightly sentimental if not for the preceding 'dangerous' language."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the authorities being 'annoyed' rather than 'curious' is a profound, non-kitsch insight into human nature.",
      "The admission that 'you cannot' get your mind around the resurrection."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the 'dangerous' and 'unsettling' edge of the gospel to ensure that the 'joy' of the ending doesn't slip into sentimentality."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by emphasizing that the power is 'unloosed' and 'given,' rather than achieved. Cilliers' 'Space for Grace' is present in the 'between'—the space between the lame man's old identity and his new leaping. However, the sermon occasionally closes space through its own rhetorical intensity; the preacher's voice is so strong that the 'unavailable' mystery sometimes feels 'explained.' Yet, by framing the resurrection as a 'surging power' that 'overrides our despair,' the sermon successfully moves the focus from human effort to divine action. It is a 'sober beauty' that points away from the preacher toward the 'inscrutable power.'",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between 'complacency' and 'newness' are sustained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'riddle of power' is acknowledged, though the preacher's tone is very confident.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; even the 'new gestures' are framed as responses to a power already at work.",
    "recommendation": "Allow for more silence or 'understatement' in the delivery/text to let the 'inscrutable' nature of God breathe more freely."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.3,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the 'New Homiletic,' blending prophetic rhetoric with narrative depth. Its primary strength lies in its 'reframing' of the Easter event from a static, historical oddity into a dynamic, contemporary 'surge of power.' The language is carefully stewarded, utilizing a central metaphor ('frozen assets') that resonates both economically and spiritually. The rhythm of the prose is musical and oral, designed to carry the hearer along a dramaturgical arc from the 'frozen' boundaries of the world to the 'leaping' freedom of the Kingdom. While the structure occasionally leans toward a traditional commentary (the numbered points), the aesthetic force of the imagery and the avoidance of religious kitsch maintain a high level of engagement. The sermon opens significant space for grace by emphasizing the 'unloosed' nature of God's power, though its rhetorical certainty occasionally borders on a 'closed' work of art. Overall, it is a sophisticated aesthetic performance that honors both the biblical text and the complexity of the human condition.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the resurrection using the 'frozen assets' metaphor.",
      "Rhythmic, oral quality of the language that creates a palpable sense of 'surging' movement.",
      "Authentic, anti-kitsch approach that takes human 'annoyance' and 'despair' seriously."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Integrate the numbered commentary points more fluidly into the narrative arc.",
      "Increase 'openness' by allowing for more questions and less 'announcement' in the conclusion.",
      "Vary the dominant metaphor slightly to avoid over-saturation of the 'assets' imagery."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Narrative (Sober-Reformed with a 'New Homiletic' edge)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson.",
    "audience_analysis": "Appeals to hearers who are weary of traditional dogmatism and seek a faith that speaks to public, socio-political reality.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer with a lingering, productive tension.",
      "Use more 'staccato' sentences during the turning point to heighten the sense of crisis.",
      "Incorporate a contemporary 'image' that is as fresh and 'un-churchy' as the 'frozen assets' metaphor."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically successful 'event' that avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch and dry moralism. It uses the 'poetics of language' to make the 'holy happen' in the intersection of an ancient text and a frozen modern world. By prioritizing 'showing' over 'telling' and 'reframing' over 'repeating,' the preacher creates a space where grace is not just a concept, but a surging, dangerous possibility. It stands as a strong example of how Reformed aesthetics can be 'soberly beautiful' while remaining radically transformative."
