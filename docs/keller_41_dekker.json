    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's primary requirement of focusing on one specific pericope. Instead, it 'mines' the book of Proverbs for 'nuggets' (topical approach), which Dekker explicitly rejects as not being a sermon. By grouping eight disparate verses, the preacher creates a thematic speech on 'money' rather than letting a single text speak its unique word.",
      "quotes": [
        "Every verse is on a different subject, so in order to gather a set of proverbs on any particular subject, you have to kind of go into the mine, pull out the nuggets, and arrange them."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one single proverb or one coherent section (pericope) and ask: 'What is in this passage that can be found nowhere else?' Avoid thematic 'nugget-mining'."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "There is adequate attention to the original context, specifically regarding the Hebrew definitions of 'righteous' vs. 'wicked' and the concept of 'fortified cities.' However, it relies heavily on secondary commentary (Waltke) rather than direct exposition of the text's own movement.",
      "quotes": [
        "Bruce Waltke... says when you and I see the words righteous and wicked... this is what the word means.",
        "The English word is detest, but the Hebrew word is the same as abomination."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond dictionary definitions and commentary quotes to show how the specific literary structure of the chosen text reveals God's character in its original setting."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is strong and concrete, avoiding generalities. It touches on business ethics, accounting practices, and personal psychological motivations (the 'idolatry' of books vs. clothes). It correctly identifies the zeitgeist of security and identity through wealth.",
      "quotes": [
        "The more money the righteous business owner makes the more generous the salaries of his employees...",
        "We usually use accounting. There are all sorts of misleading and outright deceptive accounting practices..."

      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application remains tied to the specific text's unique angle rather than general biblical wisdom on money."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a somewhat 'teaching' structure where exposition of a verse is immediately followed by its application. While not a 15/5 split, it feels more like a lecture on several texts than a single movement where the hearer is 'expounded' by the Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "In a sense, we’re going to learn three things here. We’re going to learn that money exercises great power over us, why it exercises great power over us, and how to break that power..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Abandon the 'three-point' lecture structure in favor of a narrative or rhetorical movement that draws the hearer into the text's own logic."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The three parts are clearly present in the background. Misery is identified as the 'hollowed out' character and the 'abomination' of greed. Redemption is found in Christ's 'scattering.' Gratitude is the goal of the 'generous church.'",
      "quotes": [
        "It can hollow out your character, so you don’t have the poise, endurance, strength, patience...",
        "Jesus Christ was scattered in order to gather us."

      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by showing how the specific text (e.g., Prov 30:8-9) reveals a specific form of human lostness before God."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon addresses the 'day of wrath' and the 'abomination' of sin, taking the destination of man seriously. It contrasts the 'fortified city' of God with the 'imaginary' wall of wealth. However, the 'eternal loss' aspect is somewhat softened into 'spiritual disintegration.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Wealth is worthless in the day of wrath... the day you get news that someone you love most in the world is going to die...",
        "It leads only to societal disintegration and spiritual disintegration of the person who hoards it."

      "improvement_point": "Be more explicit about the 'two ways' as ultimate possibilities of life design, as Dekker suggests."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The preacher uses the 'scattering/gathering' principle to move toward the cross. Grace is presented as the only power to break the idolatry of money. However, the transition from Proverbs to the Cross feels slightly mechanical (the 'principle' approach).",
      "quotes": [
        "The answer is to do two things... bring it into your heart through the cross of Jesus Christ.",
        "Jesus Christ on the cross did not tithe his blood or his life. He gave it all."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Show how the specific Proverb *points* to Christ, rather than using Christ as the 'solution' to a problem the Proverb merely identified."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At an estimated 34 minutes, the sermon provides the 'breadth' Miskotte and Dekker demand. It allows for psychological depth and multiple illustrations.",
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this length but focus the breadth on one text rather than eight."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily due to its formal structure: it is a topical speech ('nugget-mining') rather than the exposition of a specific Bible passage. While it is substantively strong in its psychological application and Christocentric telos, it treats the Bible as a source of 'general truths' about money rather than a current, proclamatory word from a specific pericope. The length and depth of application are adequate, but the 'three-point' teaching style hinders the 'present of revelation' Dekker seeks.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application that avoids religious clichés.",
      "Strong psychological insight into the human heart's search for security.",
      "Clear movement toward the Cross as the telos of the message."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Topical approach violates Thesis 1.3 (no specific pericope).",
      "Structure is more akin to a lecture than a proclamatory sermon.",
      "Reliance on secondary commentary over direct textual exposition."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a strong biblical teaching or 'speech about the gospel,' but according to Dekker's strict formal definition, it is not a sermon because it lacks a single underlying pericope."
