    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a sophisticated exegetical framework for the Emmaus narrative, focusing on the 'blindness' of the disciples. Theologically, it rejects a naive-realist understanding of the resurrection ('scientific proof') in favor of a hermeneutic of 'reading' signs. It correctly identifies the Jewish messianic expectation as political rather than purely individualistic. However, the 'Sache' (the living Christ) risks being subsumed by the 'Sache' of social justice. While the exegesis of the 'dawn' as a space of ambiguity is strong, the dogmatic core—the ontological reality of the Resurrection—is softened into a 'perspective' or 'interpretation,' which might leave the factual ear searching for a firmer foundation beyond human perception.",

        "Den Auferstandenen zu erfahren ist kein Faktum, das beweisbar, fotografierbar, mit Händen zu greifen ist.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals herself as an intellectual who has struggled with 'literal' faith for decades. There is a high degree of authenticity in the admission of doubt and the personal anecdote about her grandchild. The self-revelation is 'diaconal' in that it models a way of being Christian in a secularized world. However, there is a subtle 'hysterical' (Riemann) tendency in the sense of 'theological stage-presence'—the preacher positions herself as the one who has moved beyond 'childish' or 'narrow' views to a higher level of 'mindfulness' and 'transcendence.' The 'I' is prominent but serves as a bridge to the text's existential weight.",
      "quotes": [

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship to the hearer is primarily 'teaching' and 'challenging.' The preacher assumes a position of intellectual and moral authority. There is a 'we-definition' that includes the congregation in the 'rich world' and its crises, which creates solidarity but also a subtle pressure. The 'yellow' side contains significant 'noise' when the preacher labels certain groups (the 'faith-insured' and 'experience-obsessed'). This categorization can feel paternalistic or exclusionary to listeners who find themselves in those categories. The tone is more of a lecture than a pastoral conversation.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward the 'Appeal' (Anspruch). The core message is 'Resurrection is Insurrection.' While the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is present in the idea of God's 'politeness' and the 'bread that does not run out,' it is quickly converted into a demand for political action and mindfulness. The theological risk here is 'moralism'—the resurrection becomes a motivation for human ethics rather than a divine act that stands on its own. The 'red' side dominates the conclusion, moving from the mystery of Emmaus to a checklist of global justice (textile slaves, space armament, etc.).",
      "quotes": [

    "dominant_side": "Red (Appeal)",
    "disruptions": "The transition from the 'child-like' thinking to 'global economic order' feels like a communicative jump that might lose the 'relational ear'.",
    "healing_disruption": "The 'Mama, you think only in real' anecdote serves as a healing disruption, breaking the 'factual' dominance to open a space for wonder."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a rhetorically powerful and intellectually stimulating sermon that successfully bridges the gap between a biblical narrative and contemporary global ethics. Its greatest strength lies in its psychological acuity regarding 'doubt' and 'the addiction to certainty.' However, from a Barthian perspective, it teeters on the edge of 'anthropocentrism.' The resurrection (the act of God) is frequently translated into 'insurrection' (the act of man). While the preacher claims God is the 'Acting Subject,' the weight of the sermon falls on the human 'reading' and 'acting.' The 'Green' side is authentic, but the 'Yellow' side is somewhat exclusionary toward those who do not share the preacher's specific intellectual-political framework. The 'Red' side is dominant, making it a 'Sermon of the Law' (social justice) as much as a 'Sermon of the Gospel.'",
    "barthian_warning": "High risk of psychologization and sociologization. The 'living Christ' is at risk of becoming a cipher for 'the spirit of rebellion' or 'human mindfulness.'",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Brilliant use of the 'thinking in real' metaphor.",
      "Courageous naming of global injustices.",
      "Intellectual honesty regarding the 'dawn' of faith."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Balance the political 'Anspruch' with more ontological 'Zuspruch'.",
      "Soften the polemic against 'faith-insured' listeners to improve the relational aspect.",
      "Ensure the 'extra nos' of the Resurrection is not lost in the 'inter nos' of human action."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, provocative sermon that serves the 'truth' through 'disruption,' but risks losing the 'Gospel as Gift' in its zeal for 'Gospel as Task.'"
