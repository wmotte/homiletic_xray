    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exemplar of psychologically healthy homiletics. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, engaging the listeners' intellect and agency. By integrating the Free Child (joy/eros) with the Adult (historical/theological analysis), the preacher avoids the common trap of the Critical Parent. The use of personal narrative is self-disclosing rather than self-aggrandizing, fostering a genuine connection. The transition to the Nurturing Parent at the end provides a safe 'holding environment' for listeners who may feel guilt, immediately neutralizing potential shame with the concept of 'retroactive grace.'",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'Insight' as a bridge between theology and psychology, as it keeps the listener in the Adult ego position."
