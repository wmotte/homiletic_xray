    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The imagery is primarily conceptual rather than sensory. The preacher relies on the 'spatial' metaphors provided by the biblical text (height, depth, breadth, length) but does not always translate these into concrete, earthly scenes. There is a strong use of light-based imagery ('conception lights up the mind with a kind of rapid flash'), which aligns with Paul Scott Wilson’s emphasis on 'showing' the internal state of the preacher. However, the 'wild words' mentioned in the title remain largely abstract. The sermon lacks the 'stench of the pigsty' realism, opting instead for a sublime, celestial vocabulary. While the metaphors are 'living' in their rhetorical delivery, they are traditional rather than surprising. The strength lies in the 'painting' of the preacher's frustration, making the struggle with language a visible image in itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "The conception lights up the mind with a kind of rapid flash, whereas the utterance is slow, lagging.",
        "I have seen illiterate, backwoods believers aglow with what I'm talking about.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "Include more concrete, sensory details from daily life to ground the abstract 'dimensions' of love.",
        "Avoid over-reliance on the biblical text's own metaphors; create fresh contemporary analogies for 'breadth' or 'depth'.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language exhibits a high degree of 'stewardship' in the sense of Marilyn Chandler McEntyre. The preacher is remarkably precise about the *imprecision* of language. There is a deliberate avoidance of 'Canaanite jargon' in the introduction, using instead the language of Augustine and literary giants like Milton and Shakespeare to frame the problem. The word choice is sophisticated ('magnitude', 'ennoblement', 'nadir', 'consummate'). The preacher treats words as sacred instruments that are currently failing, which is a sophisticated rhetorical move. However, the latter half of the sermon falls back into more repetitive, traditional religious phrasing which, while powerful, loses some of the initial surgical precision.",
      "quotes": [
        "I am disappointed that my tongue is incapable in doing justice to that which is in my heart.",
        "The gospel seems to smile at you and say to you, 'How pitiful. You don't really think that describes me, do you?'",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition from the academic/literary tone to the 'Holy Spirit' invocation is slightly jarring in its precision.",
        "Some phrases like 'marvelous light of God's grace' border on cliché.",
        "Ensure the 'wildness' of the words is demonstrated through more daring vocabulary in the middle section."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Religious jargon is used intentionally as 'wild words' that defy reason, rather than as lazy shorthand."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. It is clearly written for the ear (oral event). The rhythm is built through classical rhetorical devices: anaphora ('Now unto him...'), parallelism ('How high... how wide...'), and a distinct cadence that moves from the 'legato' of the Augustine quote to the 'staccato' of the final doxology. The sentence structure varies beautifully, using short, punchy questions to break up longer, more reflective periods. The use of the word 'nadir' and the rhythmic repetition of 'Holy Spirit, come here!' creates a liturgical 'flow' that Immink would recognize as a performance of the 'holy happening'. It escapes 'paper language' entirely.",
      "quotes": [
        "The height of Christ's love? How high is that? The breadth of Christ's love? How wide is that?",
        "Now unto him! Now unto him who is able to make plain what is not plain! Now unto him who can lift up what is fallen down!",
        "The utterance is slow, lagging, and far unlike the thing it would convey."
      ],

        "Masterful use of repetition and rhetorical questions to build momentum.",
        "A natural 'swing' or cadence that suggests a high level of performance awareness.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The rhythmic intensity in the final third could benefit from a brief 'quiet' moment to prevent sensory overload.",
        "Some parallelisms are slightly predictable in their structure.",
        "Watch for the tendency to let rhythm override the specific meaning of the 'wild words'."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Pure oral language; the text breathes and demands to be spoken aloud."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is rhetorically sophisticated and musically driven. It excels in its oral quality, using rhythm and cadence to compensate for the admitted 'failure' of words. While the imagery is somewhat traditional and abstract, the precision with which the preacher describes the 'homiletical frustration' creates a compelling aesthetic of honesty. It avoids the dry 'paper language' of academia while maintaining a high literary standard through references to Augustine and Milton, resulting in a 'sober beauty' that feels both elevated and accessible."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' as described by Lowry. It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium'—the preacher's own failure and Augustine's disappointment. This creates a tension: if the greatest minds fail to speak of God, how can we hear Him? The movement is from the 'frustration' of human effort to the 'thrill' of divine revelation. The turning point is the shift from the 'mind' to the 'Holy Spirit'. The energy does not drop; it builds toward a doxological climax. It is not a static three-point sermon but a 'dynamic journey' from the silence of human inadequacy to the 'superabundant' praise of God.",
      "quotes": [
        "My preaching almost always displeases me.",
        "And so the frustration, but there is a thrill in it, also.",
        "I must retreat. I will never make it clear to you. But now unto him!"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The 'preacher's struggle' serves as an effective hook and narrative thread.",
        "Clear movement from human limitation to divine capability.",

      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition between the 'nine brief statements' of the Gospel and the Ephesians text could be more organic.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The 'reframing' (Cilliers) occurs by looking at the biblical text not as a set of doctrines to be explained, but as 'wild words' that defy explanation. The preacher connects the 'disquiet' of the modern hearer with the 'unsearchable riches' of the text. However, the 'context' remains somewhat general. The 'contemporary world' is addressed as a place of 'public affairs' and 'logic', but specific 20th-century anxieties are left implicit. The integration is successful in its 'vertical' dimension (God and the soul) but less so in its 'horizontal' dimension (the specific social or historical moment of the congregation).",
      "quotes": [
        "If I were an orator in any other area, in public affairs, for instance, our responsibility would be simple.",
        "This pressure that all of you feel sometimes in your life, this hankering, this disquiet.",

      "strengths": [
        "Reframes the difficulty of faith as an aesthetic 'thrill' rather than a logical problem.",

        "Connect the 'disquiet' to more specific contemporary examples or 'frames'.",
        "The 'backwoods believers' reference is a good start but could be developed into a more robust contextual bridge.",
        "Address how these 'wild words' impact specific human struggles (grief, injustice, etc.) beyond the 'mind/heart' divide."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "The sermon reframes the Gospel as an 'unsearchable' mystery rather than a 'digestible' subject."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This sermon is a prime example of Stark’s 'Open Work of Art'. By repeatedly stating 'I will never make it clear to you,' the preacher abdicates the role of the 'all-knowing teacher' and invites the hearer into the mystery. The ending is not a moralistic 'to-do' list but a doxological 'open door'. It acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (the tension between being 'born in sin' and 'rooted in love') without offering a cheap, logical resolution. It leaves the 'work' to the Holy Spirit and the hearer's own encounter, making it highly polyvalent.",
      "quotes": [
        "The gospel seems to smile at you and say to you, 'How pitiful. You don't really think that describes me, do you?'",
        "Unless the Holy Spirit interprets all that I've been saying, your mind will never grasp it!",
        "He alone can make it all plain."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Resists the urge to 'seal' the sermon with a moralistic application.",
        "Approaches the hearer as a participant in a mystery rather than a student in a classroom.",

        "Ensure the 'openness' doesn't lead to vagueness for hearers who need more concrete direction.",
        "The 'retreat' of the preacher is powerful, but could be balanced with a more specific 'invitation' to act.",
        "The 'illiterate believer' example could be seen as slightly patronizing if not handled carefully."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "An open work of art that prioritizes the 'event' of the Spirit over the 'closure' of the logic."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is sophisticated and purposefully 'incomplete'. By framing the sermon as a failed attempt to capture the infinite, the preacher creates a dramaturgical space where the Holy Spirit must act. The narrative arc moves from human intellectual frustration to spiritual surrender. It avoids the 'closed system' of traditional three-point homiletics, opting instead for a 'performance of inadequacy' that opens space for grace. The integration of text and context is strong on a phenomenological level, though it lacks specific social-historical grounding."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully avoids religious kitsch by refusing to offer 'immediate comfort' or 'pre-chewed emotions'. It takes the 'pain' of the preacher's inadequacy and the 'dazing' nature of the Gospel seriously. There is no 'happy ending' in a worldly sense; the resolution is found in the 'unsearchable' nature of God, which is the opposite of kitsch's predictability. The use of Augustine's struggle provides an 'authentic' anchor that prevents the sermon from becoming a sentimental performance. It sustains the tension between 'born in sin' and 'rooted in love' without a cheap synthesis.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The phrase 'marvelous light of God's grace' is slightly clichéd, but rescued by the surrounding context of struggle.",
      "The 'backwoods believers' trope can sometimes be used kitschily, though here it serves a rhetorical purpose regarding the limits of scholarship."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission: 'My preaching almost always displeases me.'",
      "The description of the Gospel 'smiling' at the preacher's pitiful attempts to describe it."

    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'aesthetic of inadequacy'; it is the strongest defense against the kitsch of 'easy answers'."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is a masterclass in Cilliers' 'Space for Grace'. By 'retreating' and 'backing away', the preacher literally and metaphorically creates space for the 'Divine Actor'. The sermon does not 'block' the encounter with the Holy through over-explanation or moralization. It respects the mystery of God's dimensions (height, depth, etc.) as something to be 'comprehended' by the heart rather than 'mastered' by the mind. The 'wildness' of the words is preserved, ensuring that grace remains a gift that 'exceeds abundantly' rather than a task to be completed.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between human reason and divine mystery is sustained until the very last word.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery is not only respected but is the primary subject of the sermon.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails entirely; there is virtually no moralization in the text.",
    "recommendation": "Continue to use the 'doxological retreat' as a way to ensure the sermon remains transparent toward God."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "The sermon 'Wild Words And Bright Conclusions' is an aesthetically robust example of the 'Aesthetic Turn' in homiletics. It moves away from the 'vertical revelation' as a set of propositions and instead performs the Gospel as an 'event' of mystery and grace. Its primary strength lies in its musicality and its 'open' structure, which invites the hearer into a space where the Holy Spirit is the primary agent. The preacher uses his own rhetorical 'failure' as a sophisticated aesthetic tool, creating a 'sober beauty' that avoids religious kitsch. While it could benefit from more concrete, sensory imagery and a more specific contemporary context, its rhythmic power and commitment to the 'unsearchable' nature of God make it a compelling work of homiletical art. It successfully 'reframes' the act of preaching itself as a 'thrilling frustration', thereby opening a significant 'space for grace'.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rhythmic and musical language that facilitates an 'oral event'.",
      "The 'Open Work' approach that abdicates preacher-authority to the Holy Spirit.",
      "Authentic avoidance of kitsch through the 'aesthetics of inadequacy'."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase concrete, sensory imagery to ground the abstract spatial metaphors.",
      "Provide more specific contemporary 'frames' for the human 'disquiet' mentioned.",
      "Balance the 'retreat' of the preacher with a more tangible invitation for the congregation's life in the world."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sublime-Doxological: A style that focuses on the 'unsearchable' magnitude of God through rhythmic, elevated language and a retreat from logical closure.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Gerrit Immink (Performance/Event).",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who are weary of 'easy answers' and 'moralism', and those who appreciate the 'weight' of traditional rhetorical beauty.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'showing' the 'depth' of God's love through a single, gritty narrative of human suffering and redemption.",
      "Use the 'musical rhythm' to lead into a moment of silence within the sermon to further 'open space'.",
      "Challenge the 'mind' even more by using a contemporary scientific or cultural 'mystery' as a parallel to the 'wild words' of Scripture."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is an aesthetically successful performance of the 'holy happening'. It transcends the 'bureaucratic' language of much modern preaching by embracing the poetic and the paradoxical. By centering the 'failure' of language, it paradoxically achieves a high degree of expressive power. It is a model of how a Reformed emphasis on the 'Word' can be aesthetically 'opened' to the mystery of Grace without losing theological integrity."
