        "analysis": "The preacher explicitly deconstructs the 'Moralist' position (John the Baptist as CP). He warns against the church acting as a moral police. However, a slight CP remains in the critique of 'magazines like Happiness' and 'scandalous displays of the great.'",

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The preacher avoids 'ITHY' (I'm Only Trying To Help You) by admitting he cannot solve the complex problems of the world. He avoids 'NIGYSOB' by stating that any judgment of others is a judgment of oneself. He maintains authenticity by staying in the Adult position."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and remarkably free of typical homiletical 'games.' By identifying John the Baptist as a 'moralist' and then moving beyond him to the 'Lamb,' the preacher releases the congregation from the pressure of the Adapted Child (compliance to moral law). The preacher uses his Adult ego state to model humility and intellectual honesty, particularly regarding global conflicts and personal failures. This creates a safe space for the listeners' Free Child to engage with spiritual metaphors without the threat of judgment.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of self-awareness and ego-state consistency.",
      "Deconstruction of the 'Persecutor' role in the church.",
      "Strong invitation to personal autonomy and 'learning to recognize'."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The brief 'rant' about Happiness magazines slightly shifts into Critical Parent territory.",
      "The 'energy of the dove' could be more grounded in Adult reality to avoid sounding like spiritual bypassing."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements and admit limitations. To remain game-free, ensure that the 'provisional' nature of the office doesn't become an excuse for passivity (the 'Victim' trap)."
