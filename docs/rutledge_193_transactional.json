  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Parental' homiletics. It utilizes a high-intensity Nurturing Parent to create a sense of safety, only to pivot to a Critical Parent that demands the listener accept a 'miserable' identity. While theologically orthodox in many traditions, psychologically it fosters dependency and an 'I'm Not OK' life script. The listener is rarely addressed as an Adult capable of here-and-now moral agency, but rather as a child who must be 'pursued' and 'rescued' from their own 'primordial catastrophe.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of empathy and relatable metaphors (the desperate parent).",
      "High emotional intelligence in describing the 'agonized' state of human relationships."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on the 'miserable offender' trope which can trigger shame-based paralysis.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult invitation for the listener to apply 'grace' to their own life decisions."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as 'Adults' who have the capacity for goodness as well as error. Instead of insisting 'there is no health in us,' explore how the 'Adult' can cooperate with 'Grace' to build health. Reduce the 'Switch' between the beauty of the Trinity and the wretchedness of the sinner to avoid the 'Bait & Switch' dynamic."
