    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and largely game-free. It utilizes the Adult ego state to dismantle the 'Critical Parent' view of God that often drives religious neurosis (Adapted Child behavior). By distinguishing between 'knowing about' and 'knowing,' the preacher promotes authentic intimacy over ritualistic compliance. The use of the 'Adoption' metaphor serves to grant the listener 'Permission' (in TA terms) to exist and be loved without performance, which is the cornerstone of psychological autonomy.",

      "The 'outrageous' opening hook is a minor 'Con' that could be seen as slightly manipulative.",
      "The 'War of Jenkins' Ear' illustration is a Parent-style 'didactic' moment that might briefly distance the listener."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize the 'Adult' processing of doctrine while inviting the 'Free Child' to experience the joy described. Ensure that the 'musts' of prayer are always framed as 'invitations to health' rather than 'requirements for belonging'."
