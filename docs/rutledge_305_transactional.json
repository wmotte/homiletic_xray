    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the manipulative 'games' common in homiletics. By deconstructing 'religion' (Critical Parent) and embracing 'dirt' (Free Child/Human Reality), the preacher creates a safe space for the listener's Adult ego. The emphasis on 'relationships' as the core of the Trinity provides a healthy model for human interaction that promotes autonomy and inclusion rather than dependency or shame.",

      "Effective use of humor (Free Child) to lower listener defenses.",
      "Strong Adult engagement with social reality."

      "The 'ruling class' vs 'authentic Christianity' section flirts slightly with a 'Persecutor' stance, though it remains mostly diagnostic."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements regarding fear and failure; it successfully prevents the pulpit from becoming a 'Parental' throne."
