    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates a high level of exegetical competence, particularly in the Johannine corpus. The 'Sache' is clearly Christological. The analysis of the Greek/Roman 'Styx' imagery contrasted with the 'descensus ad inferos' provides a robust dogmatic framework. The preacher avoids the trap of mere moralism by grounding the sermon in the 'Extra Nos' of the resurrection event. However, the connection between the Joban 'dust' and the Easter 'life' remains somewhat abstract; the preacher assumes a high level of theological literacy in the congregation regarding the relationship between creation and new creation. The factual side is dense but serves the theological 'Sache' of God as the Acting Subject.",
      "quotes": [
        "The symbolism of night and darkness pervades the Gospel of John.",
        "The resurrection happened at night. No one was there when it happened.",

      "comprehensibility_check": "Appropriate for a sophisticated congregation, though the Joban section requires intense concentration."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a personality that values intellectual honesty and structural order. There is a controlled vulnerability, particularly when discussing doubt ('It is a very comforting thing to me... to know that the relationship of doubt to faith is built into the Easter story'). The 'I' is present but never eclipses the 'He'. The preacher does not use the pulpit for therapy but as a witness who stands under the same Word as the congregation. There is a sense of professional distance that prevents the sermon from becoming a 'testimony' in the pietistic sense, which aligns with Barthian concerns about the 'human religious consciousness'.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is a very comforting thing to me, in my own struggle to believe...",
        "I have a dear friend whose daughter died tragically.",
        "I remember reading about it in the New York Times..."

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Schizoid mix. The preacher seeks order, structure, and theological correctness (Compulsive) while maintaining a certain analytical distance from the emotional 'noise' of the text (Schizoid).",

        "Avoidance of hysterical emotionalism."

        "The 'I' could occasionally be more 'diaconal' by showing how the Word specifically broke the preacher's own 'Compulsive' need for control.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching' and 'Solidary'. The preacher addresses the congregation as fellow-sufferers and fellow-doubters ('Have you buried someone? If you haven’t, you will'). However, there is a subtle 'paternalism' in the way the preacher explains the 'mythology of the Greeks' or 'evolutionary science'. The 'We-definition' is strong, yet the preacher remains the authoritative interpreter who provides the 'correct' way to view suffering. The relationship noise is low, but the distance is palpable; it is a view 'from the pulpit' rather than 'from the pew'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Have you buried someone? If you haven’t, you will.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon is exemplary in its balance of Zuspruch (Promise) and Anspruch (Demand). The appeal is not to 'do' more, but to 'believe' and 'receive'. The preacher correctly identifies that the Gospel is a gift. The 'red' side is directional: it points away from the self and toward the Risen Christ. The risk of moralism is very low. The demand is the 'obedience of faith', which is presented as a response to the 'Who' of God rather than a checklist of religious duties. This is a highly 'Barthian' appeal: the human subject is called to be quiet and let God be God.",
      "quotes": [
        "Do not be faithless, but believing.",
        "Let our answer be hers: 'Yes, Lord; I believe...'",
        "I believe we can hold on to the promise..."

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The promise (Zuspruch) is the absolute foundation. The demand (Anspruch) is merely the invitation to trust the promise.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Negligible. The sermon avoids 'to-do lists' entirely.",
      "strengths": [
        "The appeal is theological rather than behavioral.",
        "Strong emphasis on the 'gift' of eternal life."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The appeal to 'choose' ('We have a real choice') slightly contradicts the earlier emphasis on God as the sole Acting Subject. This could be clarified.",
        "The 'Alleluia' at the end of the first section feels slightly abrupt compared to the heavy 'night' imagery preceding it."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7,
    "summary": "This is a robust, theologically grounded sermon cycle that avoids the pitfalls of modern psychologization. The preacher successfully navigates the tension between human experience (death, doubt, dust) and divine revelation (light, wounds, whirlwind). By following the Hamburg school's requirement for clarity and the Barthian requirement for the 'Subjectivity of God', the preacher creates a space where the 'Sache' (Christ) can be heard. The sermon is strongest when it allows the biblical text to 'disrupt' human expectations, particularly in the treatment of Thomas and Job. It is weakest when it leans too heavily into a lecture-style delivery, which can create a relational distance. However, the congruence between the preacher's sober personality and the gravity of the Easter message is commendable. The transition from the 'Law' of death/dust to the 'Gospel' of the Risen Word is handled with homiletical precision.",
    "barthian_warning": "The preacher avoids 'pinning down' God to human experience. God remains the 'Who' who answers the 'Why'. No unhealthy psychologization detected.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological depth and exegetical rigor.",
      "Excellent balance of Zuspruch and Anspruch.",
      "Congruent use of 'Night' and 'Darkness' as a structural motif."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Softening the academic 'Teaching' tone to increase relational warmth.",
      "Clarifying the agency of faith (Gift vs. Choice).",
      "Bridging the gap between the 'dust' of creation and the 'wounds' of the Risen Lord more fluidly."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, ample satisfactory performance that honors the text and the listener's intelligence. It is a 'diaconal' sermon that serves the Word with integrity."
