    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily through the lens of biblical narrative. It effectively leans on the 'visual' nature of the Epiphany season. The preacher uses light as a central motif, but avoids the trap of cliché by grounding it in the 'dazzling radiance' and 'absolute power' of the Old Testament kabod. There is a strong sense of 'painting the scene' when describing Moses in the cleft of the rock or the burning bush. However, the imagery is largely derivative of the biblical text rather than contemporary metaphor. While it 'shows' the biblical world vividly, it 'tells' the contemporary application more abstractly. The use of 'gleaming bronze' and 'wheels within wheels' from Ezekiel provides a high aesthetic texture that resists simple mental digestion, honoring the 'strangeness' Cilliers advocates for.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language exhibits high stewardship (McEntyre). The preacher is linguistically precise, distinguishing between 'aseity', 'kavod', and 'doxa'. This is not mere academic jargon but a careful carving of meaning to avoid the 'religious kitsch' of sentimental glory. The prose is sober and disciplined. There is a clear effort to rescue words like 'glory' and 'enjoy' from their colloquial degradation. The precision here serves the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed tradition, ensuring that the form (clarity) matches the content (the holiness of God). The distinction between 'sentiment' and 'emotion' is handled with surgical care, particularly in the discussion of the cross as the locus of glory.",
      "quotes": [
        "A word used to identify that essence is aseity (Latin aseitas, “being from itself”)—God as he is in himself.",
        "Perhaps the very word glory seems bombastic to some, for reasons similar to recent attempts at eliminating the idea of Jesus as 'Lord.'",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a steady, rhythmic cadence, particularly in the sections that quote hymns or poetry (Herbert). However, the prose itself leans toward the 'teaching' style, which can occasionally feel like 'paper language.' The sentences are well-constructed but lack the staccato/legato variation that characterizes high oral performance. It reads more like a high-quality essay than a dramatic event. The rhythm is most palpable when the preacher uses parallelisms ('not earned, not negotiable; it is inherent and unchangeable'). The inclusion of the Sanctus and hymns provides a liturgical musicality that compensates for the somewhat didactic prose rhythm.",

        "The season following January 6 begins, continues, and comes to a climax...",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a high degree of precision and theological integrity. It avoids the 'kitsch' of modern spiritual fluff by grounding its imagery in the rugged, often terrifying 'strangeness' of the biblical text. While the prose is more didactic than poetic, it achieves a 'sober beauty' through its clarity and stewardship of words. The imagery is effective because it is 'reframed' (Cilliers) from secular fame to divine radiance. It is a text that respects the intelligence of the hearer and the holiness of the subject."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a thematic progression rather than a traditional 'Lowry Loop' plot. It begins with a definition, moves through biblical examples, and concludes with an eschatological promise. There is a sense of 'upsetting the equilibrium' by challenging the hearer's superficial view of glory, but the movement is more like a deepening spiral than a linear journey from conflict to resolution. The 'turning point' is the introduction of the Cross as the true definition of glory—a powerful 'reframing' that provides a necessary shock to the system. However, the structure remains somewhat didactic, feeling at times like a series of very well-connected points rather than a single 'event' (Immink).",
      "quotes": [
        "We will approach the season of Epiphany (or theophany) by focusing on just one word: glory.",
        "The paradox is that Jesus’ seeming defeat is actually his glory.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels at 'reframing' (Cilliers). It takes the contemporary context of 'celebrity glory' (Beyoncé, Olympic gold) and uses it as a foil to reveal the 'otherness' of divine glory. The integration is organic; the preacher doesn't just 'tack on' an application, but allows the biblical text to critique the modern world's 'minimalist notions.' The 'strangeness' of the biblical text (Ezekiel's wheels, Moses' back) is preserved, preventing the text from being 'smoothed over' for easy consumption. The synthesis between the Old Testament 'kabod' and the New Testament 'doxa' is handled with theological sophistication, showing the unity of the biblical witness.",
      "quotes": [
        "We might hear of a pop star such as Beyoncé 'in all her glory.'",
        "In the present day as in the ancient world, athletes seek glory in Olympic gold...",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "As an 'open work of art' (Stark), the sermon is somewhat 'sealed' by its strong dogmatic framework. The preacher is a 'witness' (Long) who speaks with authority, which leaves less room for the hearer's ambivalence or doubt. However, the 'openness' comes through the mystery of the 'inexpressible.' By emphasizing that we cannot look at God directly, the preacher leaves a 'space for grace' that is not filled with easy answers. The ending, while liturgical and 'closed' in a doxological sense, invites the hearer into an eternal 'enjoyment' that is polyvalent. It is a 'sober' openness—not the openness of 'anything goes,' but the openness of 'beholding a mystery.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Clearly the passage is meant to express the inexpressible, something arriving from another sphere...",
        "Actually describing the glory of God is, in a sense, an impossible task.",
        "We are to shine as the sun, we are to be given the Morning Star."

      "strengths": [
        "Respects the 'mystery' and 'inexpressibility' of God.",
        "Avoids moralistic 'to-do' lists, focusing instead on 'belonging'.",
        "Invites the hearer into a 'transformed heart' rather than a forced behavior."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Allow more room for the 'unclean lips' experience of the modern hearer—what does that 'woe' feel like now?",
        "The conclusion is very liturgical; perhaps an open-ended question would allow more 'appropriation' by the hearer.",
        "Reduce the 'definitive' tone in the teaching sections to allow for more 'sermon tasting'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A 'semi-open' work; dogmatically firm but aesthetically open to the mystery of the transcendent."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.3,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is robust and intellectually satisfying, moving from definition to biblical immersion to eschatological hope. While it lacks a dramatic 'plot' in the narrative sense, it creates movement through the 'reframing' of glory. The integration of text and context is its greatest structural strength, as it consistently uses the biblical 'otherness' to challenge contemporary subjectivism. It is a 'teaching' structure that successfully avoids being a 'lecture' by keeping the 'event' of the Cross at its center."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is a masterclass in anti-kitsch. It explicitly attacks 'sentimental or superficial human ideas of glory.' By insisting on the 'body blow' of Isaiah's vision and the 'stench' of the tomb, the preacher refuses to offer 'immediate comfort without taking the pain of suffering seriously' (Cilliers). The 'glory' presented is 'too hot to handle,' not a pre-chewed religious emotion. The preacher's refusal to use 'American superlatives' and her reliance on the 'scandal' of the cross ensures that the emotion is authentic and grounded in the 'extra nos' of the Gospel. It is the antithesis of the 'happy ending' kitsch.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential kitsch of 'Jesus as a moral exemplar' or 'social activist' is explicitly rejected.",
      "The 'sentimental' idea of glory as a 'religious option' is dismantled."

      "The description of Isaiah's 'fear and trembling' and 'unclean lips'.",
      "The paradox of 'glory in the cross'—the 'Light of the World going out'."

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens a significant 'Space for Grace' by emphasizing that glory is a 'pure gift' and 'purely at the will of the Creator.' It resists the 'moralization' that often closes space in Protestant preaching. By focusing on 'belonging' rather than 'striving,' the preacher creates a clearing where the 'Holy happens' (Immink). The 'mystery' of the inexpressible (Ezekiel) ensures that God is not 'explained away.' The tension between the 'already' of belonging and the 'not yet' of the eschatological 'Morning Star' is sustained throughout.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'devouring fire' of holiness and the 'grace and truth' of the flesh is held with integrity.",
    "mystery_respected": "High; the use of 'as it were' and the 'three ofs' in Ezekiel highlights the respect for divine mystery.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the ethical 'wholehearted living' is presented as a fruit of 'belonging,' not a condition for it.",
    "recommendation": "To further open space, the preacher could acknowledge the 'resistance' (Stark) hearers might feel toward such an objective, 'un-summoned' glory."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high-quality example of 'Sober-Reformed' aesthetics infused with the 'New Homiletic's' attention to imagery. Its primary aesthetic power lies in its 'reframing' of the central concept of 'glory'—stripping it of its kitschy, sentimental, and celebrity-driven connotations and reclothing it in the terrifying and beautiful 'otherness' of the biblical kabod. The preacher acts as a 'steward of language,' using precision and etymological depth to create a sense of intellectual and spiritual weight. While the structure is more didactic than narrative, the 'event' of the Cross provides a necessary dramaturgical pivot that prevents the sermon from becoming a mere lecture. The aesthetic is one of 'transparency'—the language doesn't call attention to itself but seeks to be a window into the 'inexpressible' glory of God. It successfully avoids religious kitsch by refusing to resolve the 'fear and trembling' of the divine encounter too quickly, insisting instead on the 'body blow' of revelation. The result is a sermon that opens a 'space for grace' by grounding human hope not in subjective perception, but in the objective, immutable nature of the Triune God.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Theological and linguistic precision (Stewardship of Language).",
      "Effective 'reframing' of glory against the backdrop of contemporary celebrity culture.",
      "Authentic aesthetic depth achieved by embracing the 'strangeness' of the Cross."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase oral musicality by varying sentence structure and length.",
      "Develop more 'horizontal' narrative tension to complement the 'vertical' revelation.",
      "Incorporate more contemporary sensory 'showing' to bridge the gap for the modern hearer."

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Poetic-Didactic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Preacher as Witness' of Thomas Long.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'seekers of depth'—hearers who are tired of superficial 'kitsch' and crave a robust, intellectually honest, and transcendent encounter with the Holy.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a 'Lowry Loop' structure to see if narrative tension can enhance the 'revelatory' moment.",
      "Read the text aloud during drafting to identify 'paper language' that needs more oral 'flow'.",
      "Try a 'Page 2' (Wilson) approach: spend more time 'showing' the 'unclean lips' of the modern world before moving to the 'glory'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically strong 'open work' that honors the mystery of God. It achieves a rare balance between intellectual rigor and sensory imagery. By rejecting kitsch and moralism, it creates a genuine 'space for grace' where the hearer is invited not to 'do more,' but to 'behold' and 'belong.' It is a model of how 'sober beauty' can be more evocative than baroque decoration."
