    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and highly 'game-free'. It identifies the 'mercantile' nature of traditional religion as a dysfunctional Parent-Child transaction (do ut des). By validating the 'dignity of inconsolability', Sölle and Steffensky prevent the listener from falling into the 'Adapted Child' role of forced gratitude. They move the discourse into an Adult-Adult space where faith is a choice of 'defiant hope' rather than a psychological 'deal' to avoid anxiety.",

      "The 'contempt' for the friends' theology could alienate listeners currently in a 'Critical Parent' phase of their own development.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name the 'ulterior transactions' in religious language (like 'blessing' being used as a 'payoff'). Maintain the 'Adult' stance that invites the listener to sit with the silence of God without rushing to a 'Rescuer' conclusion."
