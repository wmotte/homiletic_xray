    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically taxing. It operates primarily from a Critical Parent position, utilizing shame and the 'Ain't It Awful' game to create a sense of crisis. While theologically 'prophetic,' it risks crushing the listener's Adult ego by creating a false binary between heroic suffering and 'cowardly' modern life. It fosters dependency on the preacher's 'memory' rather than the listener's own spiritual autonomy.",

      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult engagement regarding how to live 'by faith' in a complex world without being 'sawn in two'."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as Adult partners in a difficult world. Instead of 'You are forgetters,' try 'How do we, together, maintain our focus in a distracting culture?' Move from 'Persecutor' (shaming) to 'Adult' (problem-solving)."
