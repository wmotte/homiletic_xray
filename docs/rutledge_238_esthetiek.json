    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The imagery is primarily anecdotal rather than sensory. Rutledge uses 'narrative snapshots'—a luncheon in NYC, a slide show on Tibet—to ground her theological polemic. While these scenes are clear, they lack the 'cinematic' depth Paul Scott Wilson advocates for. The biblical world is not 'painted'; rather, it is used as a linguistic laboratory to dissect the Greek 'akoē'. The imagery serves the argument (logos) more than the imagination. The most vivid image is the 'dull thud' of the Tibetan speaker’s words, which effectively communicates a spiritual vacuum. However, the sermon lacks sensory richness (smell, touch, sound) beyond the intellectual dialogue.",
      "quotes": [
        "He cocked his head to one side and said in a confidential tone, 'Do you believe in God?'",
        "The speaker’s words—'It’s about what we do, not about God'—fell like a dull thud.",

        "Effective use of urban, sophisticated anecdotes to create a recognizable 'world'.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Rutledge exhibits exceptional stewardship of language, consistent with McEntyre’s criteria. Her precision regarding the Greek 'akoē' and the Hebrew 'semu’a' is not mere academic pedantry but a surgical strike against 'Canaanite' jargon that has lost its meaning. She avoids the 'mushy' language of modern spirituality, opting for sharp, definitive terms. The distinction between God as 'object' and God as 'acting subject' is handled with grammatical and theological rigor. Every word serves the purpose of 'reframing' the hearer's understanding of the preaching task. The language is sophisticated yet accessible to its specific seminary audience.",
      "quotes": [
        "Do you realize you have just preached a sermon in which God is not the subject of a single sentence?",
        "If we translate the word akoē as 'hearing,' with the human being as the acting subject... we’ll never get this right.",

        "Slightly less reliance on academic 'insider' references (e.g., Union, M.Div., LXX) could broaden the aesthetic appeal.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a distinct 'staccato' rhythm, characterized by short, punchy sentences that build toward a rhetorical climax. Rutledge uses repetition effectively ('our doings, our spiritual journeys, our religious activities') to create a sense of mounting frustration with anthropocentrism. The transition from the academic analysis of Romans to the final liturgical flourish (quoting the Psalm) shows a sophisticated understanding of oral cadence. It is clearly 'spoken' language, not 'paper' language, designed to be heard in a chapel setting. The rhythm mirrors the 'racing' nature of the Word she describes.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s not about Noah! It’s about God!",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The middle section's heavy focus on translation nuances slows the rhythmic momentum.",
        "More 'legato' passages could provide a rest for the listener between the punchy anecdotes.",
        "Variation in sentence length is good, but could be even more dramatic to emphasize the 'event' of the Word."

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by 'sober beauty' and intellectual rigor. While imagery is secondary to argument, the precision of language (stewardship) is exemplary. Rutledge avoids kitsch by refusing sentimental metaphors, opting instead for a sharp, rhythmic prose that demands attention. The musicality is found in the authoritative cadence of a witness rather than the flowery prose of a poet. It is a 'rhetoric of the Word' that favors clarity and theological 'reframing' over sensory immersion."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' through the New York anecdotes, establishing a conflict: the disappearance of God from modern discourse. The tension builds through the Tibetan example, creating a 'dull thud' of despair. The turning point (peripeteia) occurs with the linguistic analysis of Romans 10, shifting the focus from 'human hearing' to 'divine message'. The resolution is not a moralistic 'do better', but a doxological 'it has been done'. The energy remains high, though the exegetical middle section risks losing the narrative drive for less-trained ears.",
      "quotes": [
        "The group received this revelation with stunned silence.",
        "That’s what sermons today tend to be about.",
        "But in the meantime the message itself, unleashed, was racing..."

      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition from the Tibetan anecdote to the Greek exegesis is slightly abrupt.",
        "The 'conflict' is largely intellectual; adding a more personal or existential 'stake' could heighten the arc.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. Rutledge performs a masterful 'reframing' (Cilliers). She takes the contemporary context of 'spirituality' and 'intellectual disdain' and places it under the lens of Romans 10. She respects the 'strangeness' of the text by refusing to make it about 'our hearing', instead forcing the context to submit to the text’s own logic. The synthesis is organic: the 'New York elite' and the 'Tibetan trekker' become modern incarnations of the 'those who did not seek me'. It is a classic example of 'form following text' (Long), where the sermon becomes the 'akoē' it describes.",
      "quotes": [
        "It duplicated my own experience exactly.",
        "If we read it without Luther and Calvin breathing down our necks, we will keep on thinking of God as the object.",
        "I have been found by those who did not seek me."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The 'reframing' of the preacher's task is radical and counter-cultural.",
        "The text is not a springboard but the actual engine of the sermon.",
        "Successful integration of high-level theology with everyday urban experiences."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'context' is somewhat narrow (academic/elite); integration with a broader socio-economic context could be explored.",
        "The 'Reformation' lens is explicitly stated; showing its power more implicitly could be even more aesthetically 'open'.",
        "Balance the 'then' and 'now' more evenly in the middle section."

      "reframing_present": "Yes. It reframes preaching from a 'human performance' to a 'divine event'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Following Stark’s 'Opera Aperta', the sermon is somewhat 'closed' in its dogmatic certainty, yet 'open' in its mystery. It is monovalent in its message—'It's about God'—leaving little room for the 'human-centered' interpretation it critiques. However, it opens a vast space for the *action* of God, which remains unavailable and mysterious. The ending is liturgical and invitational rather than moralistic. It doesn't tell the seminarians *how* to preach better; it presents them with a 'racing Word' they must join. It acknowledges the 'ambivalence' of the world's rejection but counters it with the 'certainty' of the Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "Did those who were standing around receive that witness? That is not the preacher’s concern.",
        "It is that news, beloved in Christ, which is now being entrusted to you.",
        "I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Avoids the 'closed' trap of moralism (the 'we must' syndrome).",
        "Leaves the 'success' of preaching open to God’s power, not human technique.",
        "The final 'Amen' acts as an invitation into a larger drama."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The polemic against 'labyrinth-walking' etc., can feel 'closed' to those who find God in those practices.",
        "Allow more room for the 'struggle' of the preacher who feels God is absent.",
        "The sermon is very 'sealed' in its Reformed logic; a few more 'open' questions could invite more participation."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Predominantly monovalent but opens into the 'mystery' of divine agency."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are characterized by a strong, purposeful dramaturgy. The sermon functions as an 'event' (Immink) that moves the listener from the frustration of human-centered religion to the liberation of God-centered proclamation. The integration of text and context is the structural highlight, providing a genuine 'reframing' of reality. While the structure is firm and authoritative, it avoids the 'kitsch' of easy moralism, ending instead on a high note of liturgical witness that sustains the tension between the world's silence and God's voice."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a powerful antidote to religious kitsch. Rutledge explicitly attacks the 'pre-chewed emotions' of modern 'spirituality' (labyrinth-walking, journals) when they serve as a substitute for the Holy. She refuses the 'happy ending' of human effort, instead pointing to the 'violent death' of Paul and the 'stunned silence' of the elite. There is no sentimentality here; the comfort offered is 'authentic' because it is grounded in the 'Kurios' and not in human 'spiritual capital'. It is a 'sober' aesthetic that takes the 'pain of the world's disdain' seriously.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'spiritual activities'—journals, pilgrimages, prayer lives—when used as 'what you can do without reference to God'.",
      "The 'preacherly exhortations to have more faith' which lead to 'worry about not having a sufficient amount'."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The 'stunned silence' of the intellectuals when God is mentioned.",
      "The 'racing message' that continues despite the 'violent death' of the preacher."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this rigorous 'anti-kitsch' stance by continuing to prioritize the 'acting subject' (God) over the 'feeling subject' (human)."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a textbook example of Cilliers' 'Space for Grace'. By removing the burden of 'hearing' and 'faith-building' from the human subject, Rutledge opens a massive space for the 'unleashed' Word of God. She sustains the tension between the 'not heard' (Isaiah/Paul) and the 'voice gone out to all the earth'. The mystery of God’s self-revelation to those who 'did not ask' is respected and celebrated. It is the opposite of a 'dogmatically sealed' sermon because it relies on a God who is 'found by those who did not seek'.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between human disbelief and divine proclamation is maintained until the end.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, the 'how' of the Word's power remains a holy mystery.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails entirely; moralization is explicitly rejected as 'Tibetan Buddhism' in Christian clothing.",
    "recommendation": "To further open space, perhaps acknowledge the 'silence of God' as a valid aesthetic and spiritual experience within the 'Space for Grace'."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the 'Reformed-Rhetorical' style. It eschews the 'visual excess' of modern narrative preaching in favor of a 'sober beauty' found in linguistic precision and theological depth. The aesthetic power lies in its 'reframing'—the ability to take a familiar text and a familiar context and snap them together in a way that reveals a new, God-centered reality. It is a performance of 'witness' (Long) rather than 'instruction'. The sermon’s language is 'stewarded' with great care, and its structure follows a dynamic arc that leads the hearer from the 'dull thud' of human effort to the 'racing power' of the Gospel. While it lacks sensory imagery, its intellectual and rhythmic clarity creates a 'space for grace' that is both challenging and profoundly comforting. It is a 'high-stakes' sermon where the 'Holy happens' in the recovery of the Divine Subject.",

    "conclusion": "A strong, authoritative sermon that excels in 'macro-aesthetics' (structure and reframing) and 'anti-kitsch' depth. It serves as a model for how linguistic precision can open space for the Divine Actor. While it could benefit from more 'micro-aesthetic' sensory imagery, its rhetorical impact and theological integrity make it a compelling 'event' of the Word."
