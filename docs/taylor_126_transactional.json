    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. It utilizes a 'Fear-Relief' cycle common in high-control rhetoric. By painting the outside world as a terrifying 'Ain't It Awful' landscape of AIDS and drugs, the preacher activates the listener's Adapted Child (fear). He then switches to a Nurturing Parent role, offering the 'Rapture' as a Rescuer. The theological concept of 'Covenant' is used as a psychological contract of compliance rather than a relationship of equals. The emphasis on 'shame' and 'agitation' as markers of spiritual health is particularly damaging, as it encourages a Critical Parent internal dialogue in the listener.",

      "High reliance on 'Ain't It Awful' social commentary to create anxiety.",
      "Use of shame as a tool for spiritual validation.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult engagement regarding the complexities of the text."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Shift from 'Ain't It Awful' to Adult observation. Instead of using fear of the 'Great Tribulation' to bypass the listener's reasoning, invite the listener to reflect on how they can exercise agency and responsibility in the present moment without the threat of 'shame' or 'hell' as the primary motivators."
