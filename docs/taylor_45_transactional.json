    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "While homiletically powerful and rhetorically sophisticated, the sermon is psychologically regressive. It utilizes a 'Critical Parent' to induce shame and an 'Ain't It Awful' game to create a sense of cultural and personal despair. By painting the human condition as one of 'limping' and 'vile' failure, it forces the listener into an 'Adapted Child' state, making the subsequent 'Nurturing Parent' comfort feel necessary but creating a cycle of dependency rather than true spiritual autonomy.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of narrative and imagery to engage the 'Child' ego state.",
      "Effective Adult-level critique of historical racial hypocrisy."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on shaming language ('hot flush of shame', 'losers').",
      "The transition from grace to 'must-do' religious works (Bait & Switch)."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation from an Adult-to-Adult position. Instead of telling them they are 'limping losers,' present the 'vision of Jesus' as a resource for Adult decision-making and agency in the 'here-and-now,' rather than a magical rescue from a shameful existence."
