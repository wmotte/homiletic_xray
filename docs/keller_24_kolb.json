    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon initiates concrete experience through cultural touchstones rather than personal vulnerability. It effectively uses the 'jury duty' anecdote to ground the abstract concept of judgment in a recognizable civic experience. However, it lacks a deep 'slice of life' narrative that allows the hearer to feel their own need for judgment or salvation on an emotional level before moving into intellectual analysis. The experience is more 'imagined' through literature (Tolkien, Peter Pan) than 'felt' through lived human struggle.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength of the sermon. The preacher excels at pausing to ask 'why' and exploring the human condition from multiple perspectives. The analysis of postmodernism and the tension between the desire for justice and the fear of judgment is thorough. He identifies a clear 'problem' (the conundrum) and explores it through sociological, philosophical, and theological lenses without rushing to a solution.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a solid theological framework, particularly in the third section. It connects Psalm 98 to Exodus 15 and Luke 1, demonstrating a strong grasp of biblical theology (intertextuality). The 'Big Idea'—that the cross satisfies both law and love—is logically developed. However, the exegesis of the Hebrew text itself is relatively light, focusing more on the 'logic of the gospel' than on specific word studies or historical-critical nuances.",

        "On the cross, the law is perfectly satisfied... Law and love are perfectly satisfied, equally satisfied.",

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. The sermon concludes with an internal shift in perspective ('transforms a slave into a child') rather than concrete action steps. While it mentions not taking vengeance, it lacks specific 'how-to' guidance for the hearer's Monday-to-Saturday life. The application remains largely at the level of 'thinking differently' rather than 'doing differently'.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of the 'Assimilating' learning style, focusing on the logical and theological resolution of a cultural conundrum. It begins with a recognizable civic experience (jury duty) and moves quickly into a sophisticated analysis of postmodern thought and the universal human longing for a 'True King'. The middle section is a tour de force of reflective observation, using literature and museum exhibits to frame the biblical problem of judgment. The theological solution—the substitutionary atonement—is presented with logical precision, effectively bridging the Old and New Testaments. However, the sermon falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase. While it provides a deep 'why' and a clear 'what', it offers very little 'how' for the congregation's daily life. The application is largely internal and cognitive. The balance is tilted toward the abstract and reflective, which may leave action-oriented hearers feeling unequipped.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a well-crafted intellectual and visionary exploration of Psalm 98, effectively diagnosing the human condition and providing a robust Christological answer. From a Kolb perspective, it is highly effective in the 'Reflective Observation' and 'Abstract Conceptualization' phases, making it an excellent resource for thinkers and seekers. However, it lacks the 'Active Experimentation' necessary for a complete experiential learning cycle. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'logic of the cross' and the 'practice of the Christian life' through more concrete, pragmatic application."
