    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically heavy, utilizing a Parent-Child dynamic that relies on shaming (Critical Parent) to make grace (Nurturing Parent) feel effective. While theologically rich in its use of metaphor, it risks creating a 'dependency' on the preacher/God as Rescuer, viewing the human condition primarily through the lens of 'harlotry' and 'betrayal'.",

      "Heavy reliance on the 'Drama Triangle' roles.",
      "Coercive use of 'Critical Parent' when applying 8th-century judgments to 20th-century listeners."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Address the congregation more frequently from the Adult ego position. Instead of 'You are Gomer,' try 'We can observe the patterns of Gomer in our own lives,' allowing the listener to process the data rather than simply reacting to the judgment."
