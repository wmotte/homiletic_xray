  "aristotelian_modes_analysis": {
    "logos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a strong rational architecture based on thematic development rather than strict deductive points. The preacher utilizes the motif of 'Night' and 'Light' as a logical thread to connect the Johannine prologue with the Passion and Resurrection. The argumentation is traceable: it moves from the reality of darkness (death) to the inconceivable nature of the resurrection, then to the necessity of doubt within faith (Thomas), and finally to the transcendence of God over human explanation (Job). The logic is primarily inductive, using biblical narratives to build toward a theological conclusion about the nature of revelation. However, the transition between the three distinct sections relies heavily on the liturgical calendar rather than internal rhetorical bridges, which slightly fragments the overall logical flow.",
      "quotes": [
        "The symbolism of night and darkness pervades the Gospel of John.",
        "The evangelist wants us to know that the resurrection was truly inconceivable.",
        "The story about Thomas is placed by the evangelist John at the apex of his gospel story for a specific reason."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of recurring motifs (Night, Dust, Wounds) to create thematic unity.",
        "Clear exegetical insights that explain the 'why' behind the biblical author's choices.",
        "Avoidance of logical fallacies by acknowledging the 'ambiguity and pain' inherent in faith."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Strengthen the transitions between the three Sunday segments to create a more unified argument.",
        "Provide more explicit logical connections between the 'Dust' of Job and the 'Wounds' of Jesus.",
        "Clarify the causal link between the 'Word of Jesus' and the creation of faith for a modern audience."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The Logos is anchored in literary-thematic consistency, providing a clear intellectual framework for understanding the biblical texts."
    },
    "pathos": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Pathos is the strongest element of this sermon. The preacher avoids sentimentality but achieves deep emotional resonance by grounding the gospel in 'slices of life' that are universally recognizable. The use of the tornado tragedy in Piedmont is a masterclass in homiletical pathos; it evokes raw existential questions without providing cheap answers. The sermon moves from the 'cold clasp of death' to the 'shreds of solace' we find in cemeteries, effectively touching the hearer's experiences of grief, loss, and doubt. The emotional tone is one of 'sober hope'—it acknowledges the darkness of the 'pigsty' or the 'tomb' before speaking of the light, making the eventual comfort feel earned rather than forced.",
      "quotes": [
        "You will come to know the cold clasp of death... the death of a friendship, the death of a career, the loss of youth.",
        "A man looked at the little patent-leather Easter shoes of the children lying in the ruins and said, 'If that don’t shake your faith, nothing will.'",
        "These little comforts are the best that we can do to cope with our grief and loss—walking on a beach, sitting by a grave."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Exceptional use of sensory and concrete imagery (patent-leather shoes, ashes on a beach).",
        "Authentic resonance with human suffering and the 'why' of the skeptic.",
        "Variation in tone that mirrors the movement from Good Friday darkness to Easter light."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Ensure the intensity of the Piedmont example does not overshadow the theological point of the Thomas narrative.",
        "Could incorporate more 'joyful' pathos in the final section to balance the heavy emphasis on dust and suffering.",
        "Avoid slightly repetitive descriptions of death to maintain the impact of the imagery."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The sermon excels in 'heart-pathos,' making the theological claims existentially palpable through concrete human tragedy and hope.",
      "emotional_tone": "Sober, empathetic, and ultimately hopeful."
    },
    "ethos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher establishes credibility primarily as a 'witness' rather than a 'master.' By admitting to 'my own struggle to believe,' the speaker bridges the gap between the pulpit and the pew. The ethos is one of humility; the preacher does not claim to have answers that God Himself did not give to Job. However, the persona remains somewhat formal and liturgical. While the vulnerability is present, it is often expressed through generalities ('we') or through the stories of others (the friend with the ashes, the pastor in Piedmont) rather than a sustained personal narrative. This creates a 'professional' credibility that is trustworthy but slightly distant.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is a very comforting thing to me, in my own struggle to believe...",
        "Thomas stands for all of us here. We haven’t seen the risen Lord.",
        "We proclaim to you today not our own voice but the living Word of God."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Honest admission of the difficulty of faith, which builds trust with skeptics.",
        "Authority is derived from the text ('The Bible sets before us...') rather than personal status.",
        "Congruence between the message of 'God in the whirlwind' and the preacher's own humble stance."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Increase personal vulnerability by sharing a specific instance of the 'struggle to believe' mentioned.",
        "Reduce reliance on third-party stories to establish the 'witness' role.",
        "Balance the liturgical formality with more direct, conversational engagement to lower the 'ivory tower' perception."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Ethos is established through intellectual honesty and shared struggle, though it maintains a traditional clerical distance.",
      "authenticity": "High degree of intellectual honesty; moderate personal vulnerability."

  "rhetorical_balance_analysis": {
    "dominant_mode": "Pathos",
    "suppressed_mode": "Ethos",
    "balance_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably well-balanced for a liturgical setting. Pathos drives the engagement, using powerful imagery to open the hearer's heart. Logos provides the necessary container, ensuring the emotions are tied to the biblical text (John and Job) rather than floating freely. Ethos supports the other two by validating the hearer's doubts. The three modes reinforce each other: the logic of the 'inconceivable' resurrection (Logos) justifies the emotional weight of the 'night' (Pathos), which is delivered by a preacher who admits to the same struggle (Ethos).",
    "consequences_of_imbalance": [
      "The heavy Pathos risks overwhelming the hearer if they are currently in deep trauma (e.g., the Piedmont story).",
      "The slightly lower Ethos might make the sermon feel like a very well-crafted 'performance' of empathy rather than a raw personal encounter.",
      "The logical jumps between the three Sundays might lose hearers who are looking for a singular, sustained argument."
    ],
    "recommendation_for_balance": "To reach an optimal balance, the preacher should weave more of their personal 'witness' (Ethos) into the logical structure (Logos) to anchor the high-intensity Pathos."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_rhetorical_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of modern homiletics that respects the intelligence and the pain of the listener. It avoids the pitfall of 'easy answers' by leaning into the Aristotelian mode of Pathos, using concrete and often harrowing imagery to illustrate the human condition. The Logos is sophisticated, particularly in its treatment of the Gospel of John's literary structure. While the preacher's Ethos is credible and humble, it occasionally feels secondary to the powerful narratives of others. The sermon's greatest strength is its refusal to domesticate God, presenting instead a 'baffling' and 'infuriating' Deity who is ultimately trustworthy because He has entered the 'night' of human suffering. It is a sermon that serves the 'whole person' by acknowledging the head's doubts and the heart's grief.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful use of concrete, sensory imagery to evoke Pathos.",
      "Intellectual honesty regarding the relationship between doubt and faith.",
      "Strong thematic consistency using the 'Night/Light' and 'Dust' motifs."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Bridge the three liturgical sections with stronger internal transitions.",
      "Deepen personal Ethos by moving beyond 'we' to more specific 'I' witness.",
      "Provide more concrete 'orthopraxy'—how does this faith look in the Monday-to-Saturday world?"
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Witnessing-Narrative",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who are skeptical, grieving, or tired of 'pious platitudes' will find this sermon highly persuasive and comforting.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more deductive Logos structure to see if it clarifies the 'Who' vs 'Why' argument.",
      "Incorporate a personal story of faith-in-action to strengthen Ethos and Orthopraxy.",
      "Use more silence or rhetorical pauses after high-Pathos moments like the Piedmont story."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon achieves a score of 7/10, marking it as a 'good to very good' piece of rhetorical work. It excels in Pathos and maintains a high level of Logos, making it a credible and moving proclamation of the Easter message. It avoids the common ecclesiastical trap of 'head-pathos' by forcing the listener to stand at the grave and in the ruins of the tornado, thereby making the 'Alleluia' feel authentic rather than merely traditional."
