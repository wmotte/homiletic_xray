    "summary": "This is a remarkably healthy sermon from a TA perspective. It avoids the common trap of the 'Moralizing Parent' and instead uses an 'Integrated Adult' to bridge the gap between deep emotional needs (Mysticism/Child) and social reality (Prophecy/Adult). By admitting her own flaws ('duselig'), the preacher dismantles the hierarchy that usually fuels psychological games in the church.",

      "The language is highly intellectual; less 'Adult' listeners might feel excluded or retreat into a passive 'Adapted Child' state of awe.",
      "The critique of 'fairness' vs 'justice' could be perceived as a 'Critical Parent' moment if not carefully balanced with the 'we' perspective."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' and 'I' to maintain the level playing field. Ensure that the 'mystical' comfort doesn't become a 'Rescuer' mechanism that allows listeners to ignore the 'Prophetic' call to action."
