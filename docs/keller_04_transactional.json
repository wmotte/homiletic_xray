It avoids the common religious trap of 'Stoicism' (Adapted Child/Critical Parent) and instead promotes emotional honesty and Adult-level self-reflection. By giving the listener permission to 'cry' while maintaining moral 'disciplines,' it balances the Nurturing Parent and Adult ego states effectively. It avoids manipulative games by being realistic about the 'inevitability' of pain rather than promising a 'Rescuer' exit.",
