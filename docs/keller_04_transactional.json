        "presence": "High",
        "analysis": "The Nurturing Parent is evident in the permission given to the listener to feel pain. It promotes autonomy by encouraging the listener to 'take hold of God' directly.",

        "score": 9,
        "score_explanation": "10 = Free from fear/compliance. The preacher does not use fear of God to force compliance, but rather uses the 'Free Child' of Christ to alleviate fear.",
        "presence_of_adaptation": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher actively deconstructs the 'Adapted Child' response (stoicism/stiff upper lip) and encourages authentic emotional expression.",

    "primary_transaction_style": "Adult -> Adult",
    "analysis": "The preacher primarily uses information-sharing and logical deduction. Even when moving into Parent roles, it is to offer 'permission' (NP) rather than 'prohibition' (CP).",

    "purity_explanation": "The sermon is highly transparent. It avoids the 'Bait & Switch' of promising prosperity for faith.",
    "risk_explanation": "The only minor risk is the 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' (ITHY) dynamic if the preacher presented himself as the expert on pain, but he avoids this by citing his own observations as a learner."

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The preacher avoids 'Ain't It Awful' by moving from the reality of suffering to the agency of the believer. He avoids 'NIGYSOB' by identifying with the 'unrighteous' and placing the focus on Christ’s suffering rather than the congregation's failures."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely game-free. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the 'Critical Parent' who demands joy during trials. Instead, it uses an 'Adult' ego state to process the reality of pain while using a 'Nurturing Parent' state to give the listener permission to grieve. By deconstructing stoicism, the preacher prevents the listener from falling into a 'False Self' or 'Adapted Child' persona. The use of the 2009 recession example grounds the spiritual claims in reality-testing, a hallmark of the Adult ego state.",
    "strengths": [
      "Validation of authentic emotion (Free Child/NP).",
      "Clear, logical structure (Adult).",
      "Avoidance of the 'Prosperity' game/con."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Slightly high 'Critical Parent' generalizations regarding 'Americans' or 'New Yorkers' could alienate some listeners.",
      "More 'Free Child' spontaneity could balance the heavy 'Adult' processing."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to offer 'Permissions' rather than 'Injunctions.' The phrase 'Don't be a stoic; cry' is a powerful NP permission that breaks dysfunctional scripts."
