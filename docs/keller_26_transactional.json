    "summary": "The sermon is a sophisticated blend of high-level Adult data processing and Critical Parent warnings. While it avoids crude 'fire and brimstone' tactics, it utilizes existential dread ('Ain't It Awful') to create a psychological vacuum that only the preacher’s theological solution can fill. However, the vivid appeal to the Free Child's sense of joy and beauty provides a genuine path toward authentic experience rather than just fearful compliance.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to present the 'Refuge' as a choice for a flourishing life rather than the only escape from a terrifyingly nihilistic universe. This shifts the transaction from a fear-based P-C to an autonomy-based A-A."
