    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The factual content is primarily narrative and anecdotal rather than exegetical. The preacher provides a basic overview of the Johannine text, noting the number of miracles in John and the uniqueness of the 'born blind' condition. However, the 'Sache' (the living Christ) is often filtered through the lens of human utility. The exegesis of the 'mud and spit' is handled as an 'accommodation to poor understanding,' which avoids deeper sacramental or christological implications in favor of a psychological explanation. While the rejection of the causality between sin and suffering is theologically sound (Barthian 'No' to natural theology), the factual side remains subservient to the experiential narrative, potentially thinning out the dogmatic substance of the Fourth Gospel.",
      "quotes": [
        "this is the only case where a man was born blind",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as a seasoned, well-connected figure in the ecclesiastical world (referencing colleagues and his own library). There is a strong sense of 'Selbstdarstellung' (image management) as a man of experience and authority. However, a genuine 'Selbstenthüllung' occurs in his irritation with 'faultfinders,' revealing a preacher who values loyalty and momentum. The green side is vibrant; the preacher does not hide behind a mask of objectivity but speaks as a witness. The 'I' is prominent, yet it seeks to point toward the 'He' (Christ), though the boundary between the preacher's success and God's grace occasionally blurs.",
      "quotes": [
        "I count well more than a thousand on my own bookshelves",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is one of a 'Teaching Father' or 'Spiritual Leader.' The preacher uses 'we' to create solidarity, but quickly shifts to a confrontational 'you' when addressing 'faultfinders.' There is a clear 'We-definition' of a struggling but overcoming community. However, the tone toward critics is harsh ('shut up, go somewhere'), which creates a 'Relationship Noise.' While this may energize the 'in-group,' it risks alienating those who are currently in a 'depressive' or 'doubting' phase of faith. The authority is exercised 'from above,' demanding a specific emotional response (optimism).",
      "quotes": [

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The appeal is the dominant side, but it is heavily weighted toward 'Anspruch' (Demand). The preacher demands 'authentic Christian optimism' and 'radiant hopefulness.' While the sermon claims to be about God's power, the 'Red Side' often lands as a moral imperative: 'Be an encouragement giver.' The theological 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is present in the 'God is able' litany, but it is framed as a reward for those who 'take their stand.' There is a significant risk of moralism where faith is equated with 'bright hearts' and 'success,' potentially crushing those who remain 'blind' or 'broken' despite their prayers.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ask God to bring you to a radiant hopefulness",

  "congruence_and_disruptions": {
    "congruence_judgment": "The sermon is highly congruent in its 'Hysterical' type—the energy, the anecdotes, and the appeals all align. However, there is a theological incongruence between the 'Sola Gratia' of the Gospel and the 'Authority of Experience' which leans toward a theology of glory.",

    "disruptions": "The 'Yellow' noise regarding critics disrupts the 'Blue' message of grace.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 5.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a powerful example of experiential homiletics, yet it teeters on the edge of psychologization. From a Schulz von Thun perspective, the 'Green' and 'Red' sides dominate, creating a compelling but demanding atmosphere. Theologically, it follows the tradition of Gerrit Immink by focusing on the 'Acting Subject' (God is able), but it risks pinning the Revelation to human 'Erlebnis' (experience) in a way that Karl Barth would find precarious. The preacher's 'Riemannian' tendency toward the 'Hysterical' type ensures a high-energy delivery but occasionally places the preacher's own persona and library at the center of the 'Blue' factual content. The 'Yellow' relationship is solidary yet exclusionary toward those who struggle with 'negative' feelings. Ultimately, the sermon succeeds as a motivational speech but lacks the 'diaconal' humility that allows the text to stand over the preacher's experience.",
    "barthian_warning": "High psychologization: The 'Authority of Experience' risks replacing the 'Authority of the Word.' Faith is presented as a psychological state of optimism.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Rhetorical rhythm and 'drive'",
      "Effective use of narrative to illustrate points",
      "Strong communal 'We' identity"
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce the 'Anspruch' (demand) for cheerfulness",
      "Increase the 'Blue' depth of the Christological 'Sign'",
      "Moderate the 'Green' self-referentiality"
    ],
    "conclusion": "A rhetorically strong, 'satisfactory' sermon that serves the congregation's morale but risks moralizing the life of faith through the 'tyranny of experience.'"
