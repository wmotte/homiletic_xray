    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a solid exegetical foundation based on Micah 4, focusing on the imagery of disarmament and agrarian modesty. The 'Sache' (the living Christ) is linked to the text via an Easter lens in the final section. However, the factual side remains somewhat abstract; it treats the poem as a literary 'act' rather than diving deep into the historical-critical tension of the Micah/Isaiah parallel. The theological depth is found in the critique of 'royal sumptuousness' versus 'agrarian modesty,' but it risks becoming a sociological lecture on consumerism rather than a dogmatic exploration of God's sovereignty. The blue side is clear but serves primarily as a launchpad for the preacher's social-ethical vision.",
      "quotes": [
        "The image is of people willingly dismantling their weapons...",
        "The poet anticipates neighbors enjoying a very modest kind of life...",
        "This statement about religious loyalties proposes that the peaceable 'live and let live'."

      "strengths": [
        "Clear structural breakdown of the biblical text's conditions.",
        "Effective translation of ancient agrarian imagery into modern economic critique."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Greater emphasis on the 'Acting Subject' (God) rather than the 'Poem' as the agent of change.",
        "More rigorous exegetical grounding of the 'live and let live' interpretation of verse 5."

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The language is accessible, though the concept of 'imaginative utterance' may be abstract for some."

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a sophisticated, intellectual faith. There is a clear 'Selbstdarstellung' of the preacher as a 'wise observer' or 'poetic guide.' Little 'leaks' in terms of personal vulnerability; the 'I' is largely absent, replaced by a collective 'we' or a detached 'the poet.' This creates a professional distance. The preacher reveals a strong distaste for 'military consumerism' and 'aggressive patriotism,' which signals a specific political-theological orientation. The authenticity is found in the passion for the 'future' rather than personal anecdote, which keeps the focus on the message but can feel somewhat sterile or academic.",
      "quotes": [
        "This verse suggests to me that we must think again...",
        "Poets—like Micah—do not argue... they glimpse and show.",
        "I [suggest] there are days to come because God is Lord."

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Schizoid-Compulsive. The preacher maintains a cognitive distance (Schizoid) and relies on a very structured, logical unfolding of the 'poem's conditions' (Compulsive).",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is subservient to the text, but almost to the point of being a 'talking head' for the theology.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher to Student' or 'Prophetic Critic to Society.' The preacher uses 'we' to soften the blow, but the 'we' often feels like a rhetorical device to include the congregation in a critique of 'our culture.' There is a paternalistic undertone in the way the preacher 'invites' the congregation to imagine. The relationship is solidary in its shared 'unbearable present,' but the preacher remains the one who holds the key to the 'imaginative utterance.' The tone is sober and serious, which may feel 'from above' to a listener seeking comfort rather than a challenge.",
      "quotes": [
        "The poem pushes us who listen into the future.",
        "Think what would happen in the church if there were disarmament...",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward 'Anspruch' (Demand). While it starts with the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) of God's future, it quickly moves to the 'conditions' for peace: disarmament, lowered expectations, and religious tolerance. The 'Red Side' is prominent: 'we must take care,' 'we must think again,' 'we must abandon.' The Gospel (Easter) is introduced late as a 'capacity' for newness, but the weight of the sermon rests on the human 'task' to undertake the future. There is a significant risk of moralism, where the 'Good News' is essentially 'you can choose to be a peacemaker.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The future is not only a gift from God but is a task for the faithful to undertake.",
        "We must abandon such appetites and settle for modesty.",

        "Strong call to repentance regarding consumerism."

    "disruptions": "Incongruence between the 'Good News' conclusion and the heavy 'Repentance' requirements in the body.",

    "overall_communication_score": 6,
    "summary": "This sermon is a intellectually stimulating and rhetorically polished piece of homiletics. It excels in its 'Blue' side by making an ancient text relevant to contemporary socio-political crises. However, from a Barthian perspective, it leans dangerously toward psychologization and moralism. The 'Resurrection' is treated as a 'capacity for newness' or an 'option' rather than the ontological explosion of God's victory over death. The 'Green' side is overly controlled, lacking the 'Selbstenthüllung' that would make the preacher a fellow traveler in the 'unbearable present.' The 'Red' side dominates; the Gospel is presented as a 'summons' and a 'task' more than a 'promise.' While the 'Yellow' side is respectful, the overall effect is one of a lecture on 'Theology of Hope' rather than a proclamation of the Gospel. It is a 'satisfactory' sermon that provides a 'healing disruption' regarding consumerism but fails to fully ground that disruption in the 'Zuspruch' of the Resurrection.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon risks turning God into a 'possibility' for human imagination rather than the 'Acting Subject' who has already disarmed the powers.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Sharp cultural critique.",
      "Clear structural development.",
      "Effective use of the 'Poem' metaphor."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Increase the 'Zuspruch' (Gospel promise) relative to the 'Anspruch' (Moral demand).",
      "Inject more personal vulnerability (Green side) to bridge the academic gap.",
      "Ground the 'Easter' connection more deeply in the person of Christ rather than the concept of 'newness'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A competent, prophetic-intellectual sermon that serves the 'Sache' of peace well, but lacks the theological 'rest' that comes from a primary focus on Grace."
