To him be the glory for ever and ever. AMEN."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to isolate what is unique to Romans 14:10-12. Instead of a specific exposition of the 'judgment seat of God' in its context of communal disputes (strong vs. weak), the text is used as a springboard for a general discourse on judgment, social justice, and the AIDS crisis. It treats the Bible as a collection of keywords rather than a specific proclamatory word.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have been thinking about the words of St. Paul: 'We will all stand before the judgment seat of God.' The scene from Matthew 25 comes before me...",
        "In the same way Paul is aware that it is a constant temptation to make grace an idol..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify what Romans 14 says about judgment that Matthew 25 or Psalm 103 does not. Focus on the specific 'why' of the text: the prohibition of judging the brother within the community of faith."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of Greek/Hebrew study or engagement with the historical context of the Roman house churches. The distinction between 'strong' and 'weak' is mentioned but immediately psychologized or modernized without explaining what these categories meant for the first readers.",
      "quotes": [
        "Paul calls these two groups 'the strong' and 'the weak.' He says that if the 'stronger' teachers start feeling superior to the 'weaker'..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explain the concrete historical conflict in Rome (dietary laws, holy days) to show why Paul invokes the judgment seat, rather than jumping to modern social categories."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part of the text. It is highly concrete, referencing the 1987 AIDS crisis, homelessness in NYC, and specific interpersonal dynamics (Sally and John). It avoids 'general truths' by naming specific fears and social realities.",
      "quotes": [
        "In 1987, the homelessness in New York City was much more visible...",
        "Who is more in need of Christianity, the woman with the junkie lover, Sally, the deranged homeless woman, you or me?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application flows from the specific text's logic rather than being a topical reflection on current events triggered by a biblical quote."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is interwoven, but it is an interweaving of anecdotes and general theological reflections rather than exposition and application. The 'hearer' is indeed drawn in, but not necessarily 'into the text'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Maybe you are a person who, like the woman with the junkie lover, continually engages in self-destructive behavior... Or maybe you are a person who feels superior..."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The three parts are present in the background. Misery is articulated through the lens of self-destruction and hardheartedness. Redemption is external (God's move). Gratitude is mentioned as the purpose of life. However, the 'misery' often feels more like psychological 'neediness' than theological 'misery before God'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The gap between us and a perfectly righteous God is just too great, unless he makes the move.",
        "the purpose of human life is to glorify him and give thanks for his amazing mercy..."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon flirts with the 'two ways' by mentioning the 'judgment seat' and 'being lost', but it quickly softens the blow with a universalizing tone ('All the teams are going to be in God’s World Series'). The seriousness of the 'narrow way' is undermined by a focus on psychological comfort.",
      "quotes": [
        "Depart from me, you who are cursed.",
        "All the teams are going to be in God’s World Series."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Maintain the tension of the 'judgment seat' without resolving it too quickly into a general 'everyone is included' sentiment, which Dekker warns takes neither God nor man seriously."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos in the sense that he 'submitted to the Judgment in our place'. The sermon correctly identifies that salvation is outside the self. However, the Christology is somewhat generic and not specifically tied to the Lordship of Christ as argued in Romans 14.",
      "quotes": [
        "but instead has submitted to the Judgment in our place.",
        "Man has no life in himself, it is Christ who is his life."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1550 words, the sermon likely clocks in at 15-16 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for true 'depth'. The sermon feels like a series of vignettes rather than a sustained theological 'mounting of the wheel'.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section to provide the 'breadth' necessary for a deeper theological claim."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily due to its lack of specific biblical exposition and its brevity. It functions more as a topical address on judgment and social empathy than a 'recreation of the Bible into a new, current, proclamatory word'. While the contemporary application is vivid and concrete, it is not sufficiently anchored in the unique logic of Romans 14.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application: The use of the 1987 NYC context (AIDS, homelessness) avoids the 'general truths' Dekker forbids.",
      "Theological direction: Correctly identifies that redemption must come from 'outside' the human subject (extra nos)."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specificity: Fails to answer what Romans 14:10-12 says that cannot be found elsewhere.",
      "Absence of technical exegesis: No engagement with original languages or historical context of the Roman church.",
      "Insufficient length: Below the 20-minute threshold required for homiletic depth."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an engaging religious speech with strong social observations, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense because it lacks the formal requirement of specific biblical exposition and the necessary breadth for depth."
