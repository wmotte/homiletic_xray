    "sermon_start_end": "I am the one who gets to remind you of your real family and your real parents, your awesome father and your remembering mother. The Isaiah text is addressed to people in severe displacement who judge that they have been forgotten and neglected by God. [...] Think of the table, all of you who have traces of orphan-like feeling about your life. Here is homecoming. Here is the gracious mother God, the self-giving father God who meets us. We depart the table fully loved and sent back, with our names written down, sent again to be a covenant to the peoples.",
    "notes": "The sermon employs a strong parental metaphor to bridge Old Testament prophecy and New Testament ethics."

    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a solid exegetical foundation, particularly regarding the Isaiah text. The 'Sache' is the faithfulness of God amidst displacement. The explanation of the nursing mother metaphor and the cultural context of 'writing on the hand' (even with the Sarah Palin anecdote) serves to make the ancient text accessible. However, the dogmatic depth is somewhat sacrificed for metaphorical consistency. The transition to the 'Father' in the New Testament is functional but lacks the exegetical rigor applied to the Isaiah passage. The 'blue' side remains largely at the service of the 'green' and 'red' sides, functioning more as a narrative setup than a deep theological exploration of the nature of God's being (Barthian 'Gotteslehre').",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a persona that is deeply pastoral yet socially conscious. There is a sense of 'diaconal' self-revelation; the preacher positions themselves as a 'reminder' rather than an innovator. The use of the Sarah Palin reference and the comment about 'where we Episcopalians are not supposed to read' reveals a preacher who is comfortable in their tradition but willing to poke at its boundaries. The tone suggests a deep personal conviction regarding social justice as the natural byproduct of faith. There is no overt 'hysterical' stage-seeking, but rather a 'depressive' (in the Riemann sense) desire for communal harmony and the restoration of the 'body politic'.",
      "quotes": [
        "I am the one who gets to remind you of your real family.",

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive/Compulsive mix. The preacher seeks to heal the 'orphan' state (Depressive - seeking closeness/belonging) while providing a clear, structured mandate for social order (Compulsive - focus on the 'mandate' and 'covenant').",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is largely subservient, acting as a herald of the 'news' rather than the center of the story.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Solidary'. The preacher speaks as a member of the family ('our real father', 'we begin to imagine'). However, there is a subtle shift to a 'Teaching' authority when diagnosing society's ills. The preacher assumes a shared perspective on social issues (poverty, prisons, narcissism). This creates a strong 'we-definition' for those who agree, but might create 'relationship noise' for those who feel the preacher is being overly political. The address 'all of you who have traces of orphan-like feeling' is a tender, inclusive relational move that lowers the distance between pulpit and pew.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon struggles with the balance between Zuspruch (Promise) and Anspruch (Demand). While it begins with the promise of God’s motherhood/fatherhood, it quickly pivots to a heavy 'mandate' (Section III). The list of tasks—establishing land, redistributing resources, freeing prisoners—is presented as the 'mandate of being a covenant'. There is a risk here of 'moralism' where the Gospel (God's care) becomes merely the fuel for human social activism. The theological logic is: 'Because you are loved, you must fix society.' While homiletically common, it risks burying the 'Gift' under the 'Task'.",
      "quotes": [
        "And here is the mandate for us and our society.",

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The Anspruch (Demand) is very specific and heavy, potentially outweighing the Zuspruch (Promise) for the 'Appeal Ear'.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "High. The sermon moves rapidly from the comfort of Psalm 131 to a socio-political to-do list.",
      "strengths": [

    "disruptions": "The transition from the 'nursing mother' imagery to 'redistributing resources' is a sudden jump from the psychological/intimate to the structural/political, which may cause 'noise' for listeners seeking purely spiritual comfort.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "The sermon 'Orphans Come Home' is a rhetorically skilled piece that effectively utilizes the Four-Sides-Model, though it leans heavily on the Appeal side. The preacher successfully bridges the gap between ancient text and contemporary anxiety using the 'orphan' metaphor. Theologically, it follows a Barthian impulse by starting with God's self-revelation (Mother/Father), but it risks sliding into a 'theology of works' by framing the covenant primarily as a social mandate. The psychological movement from anxiety (orphanhood) to rest (Psalm 131) to action (Matthew 6:33) is well-structured. However, the 'Red' side (Appeal) is so dominant in the middle section that the 'Blue' side (Factual/Dogmatic) of Grace risks being overshadowed by the 'Anspruch' of social justice. The 'Green' side is authentic and diaconal, avoiding the pitfall of the 'Hysterical' type. The 'Yellow' side is solidary, though potentially polarizing for those who do not share the preacher's socio-political hermeneutic.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a slight psychologization of the 'orphan' state. The sermon risks making God's motherhood/fatherhood a 'resource' for human social improvement rather than an end in itself.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Powerful and consistent 'orphan' metaphor.",
      "Strong integration of Old and New Testament texts.",
      "Excellent use of inclusive, pastoral language."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Balance the social mandate with more emphasis on the 'Gift' of the Gospel.",
      "Deepen the Christological grounding of the 'Table'.",
      "Reduce the 'Compulsive' tendency to turn every promise into a list of tasks."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, professional sermon that communicates clearly but requires more theological 'rest' in the Promise to avoid becoming a purely ethical lecture."
