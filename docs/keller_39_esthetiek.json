    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily as a pedagogical tool rather than a poetic immersion. Keller employs 'conceptual imagery'—metaphors designed to clarify doctrine (the 'Better Homes and Gardens' house, the 'defense attorney'). While these are effective for understanding, they lack sensory depth. The preacher 'tells' the meaning of the image quickly to ensure theological precision, which prevents the hearer from dwelling in the sensory world of the text. There is little 'painting' of the biblical scene in the Upper Room; the focus is on the abstract mechanics of the Trinity and the Advocate. The imagery is functional, serving the 'Logos' more than the 'Aesthetics'.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in 'stewardship of language' through its analytical precision. Every word is chosen to navigate theological minefields (e.g., the distinction between 'another of the same kind' vs. 'another of a different kind'). The preacher avoids vague religious 'Canaanite' jargon by defining terms through contemporary equivalents ('ultimate friend'). There is a high degree of nuance in describing human psychology—manipulation, approval-seeking, and addiction to power. The language is economical and hits the core of the doctrine without unnecessary baroque decoration, reflecting a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic of clarity.",
      "quotes": [
        "Advocate is a little too hard. Comforter is a little too soft. Helper is a little too weak.",
        "There’s not one God and one person, not three gods and three persons. There’s one God in three persons.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The rhythm is that of a teacher or a conversationalist rather than a poet. The sentence structure is often staccato and interrogative ('Do you see? How does that work?'). While this maintains engagement, it lacks the 'legato' of contemplative or high-rhetorical preaching. The musicality is sacrificed for the sake of 'flow' and logical progression. There are few instances of alliteration or poetic cadence. It is 'oral language', but it is the language of the lecture hall, not the sanctuary. The rhythm serves the 'argument' rather than the 'event' of the Word.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 6.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' of clarity and precision. It functions as a sharp instrument for theological surgery rather than a tapestry of sensory experience. While it lacks poetic musicality and deep sensory imagery, it honors the 'stewardship of words' through its refusal to hide behind vague jargon. The aesthetic appeal lies in the elegance of the logic and the honesty of the psychological observations. It is a 'Logos-heavy' poetics that values truth-telling over beauty-making, yet finds a certain beauty in the truth itself."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with the 'mystery' of the Spirit (upsetting the equilibrium), moves through the 'dizzying' doctrine of the Trinity, and reaches a climax in the courtroom scene of the 'First Advocate'. The movement from the Spirit (internal) to Christ (external/legal) and back to the Spirit (internal peace) creates a satisfying arc. However, the 'three-point' structure is still visible, which occasionally makes the movement feel like a series of steps rather than a seamless journey. The tension is maintained by the preacher's constant challenging of the hearer's self-perception.",

        "When it comes to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, without a doubt, the Holy Spirit is the most mysterious of the three.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong point. The sermon 'reframes' (Cilliers) the ancient concept of the 'Paraclete' using the modern frame of the 'Ultimate Friend' and the 'Defense Attorney'. It connects the Upper Room to the psychological realities of a New Yorker (addiction to approval, working to death). The synthesis between the Greek grammar (allos vs. heteros) and the existential need for a 'friend who argues with you' is seamless. The text is not a springboard; the context is truly read through the lens of the text. It avoids the 'then-and-now' split by showing how the Spirit's work is an ongoing 'event' in the hearer's current life.",
      "quotes": [
        "I woke up the morning he was supposed to arrive, and I didn’t recognize my house.",

        "Could explore more 'communal' context (the 'y'all' mentioned) rather than focusing almost entirely on the individual heart.",
        "The integration of the 'Spirit of Truth' could be more grounded in current 'post-truth' cultural challenges."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes. It reframes the Spirit from a 'force' to a 'person' and the Christian life from 'earning' to 'living in an infallible case'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is relatively 'closed' in its theological conclusions. It functions more as an 'Opera Informativa' than an 'Opera Aperta' (Stark). The preacher provides clear, definitive answers to the questions raised. While there is room for the hearer's 'experience' (the Edwards quote), the interpretation of that experience is tightly controlled by the theological framework. The ending is a call to 'obey', which, while biblically grounded, leans toward a prescriptive closure. However, the 'mystery' of the Trinity is acknowledged, and the 'Space for Grace' is opened by the emphasis on Christ's finished work, which prevents the sermon from being purely moralistic.",
      "quotes": [
        "How do you like it in here? ... It’s genius.",
        "If you have the Holy Spirit, what I just read is not completely foreign to you. You know what he’s talking about.",
        "Stop thinking about yourself all the time. Stop your self-assertion. Stop your self-indulgence."

      "strengths": [
        "The use of the Jonathan Edwards quote allows for a 'polyphonic' dimension of experience.",
        "The 'mystery' of the Trinity is invited rather than just explained away.",
        "The 'unconditional' nature of the First Advocate's case leaves an open door for the 'despondent'."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The concluding 'Stop... stop... stop...' is quite monovalent and directive.",
        "Leave more 'unanswered' space for the hearer to contemplate the Spirit's presence without immediate 'steps'.",
        "The 'logic' of the sermon is so tight it leaves little room for 'resistance' or 'ambivalence'."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Predominantly monovalent/closed; it seeks to convince and clarify rather than to evoke and suggest."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are characterized by a strong, logical dramaturgy that moves the hearer from theological confusion to existential assurance. The 'reframing' of the Paraclete is the sermon's greatest structural achievement, successfully bridging the gap between the Johannine text and the modern psyche. While the structure is somewhat 'closed' by its pedagogical intent, the movement toward the 'First Advocate' creates a profound 'Space for Grace' that transcends simple moralism. It is a well-constructed 'event' of teaching that aims for a 'transformation of the mind'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'cheap comfort' by emphasizing that the Spirit is a friend who 'argues' with you and convicts you of sin. It does not offer a 'happy ending' based on human effort but on a 'legal case' in heaven. The emotions described (via Edwards) are intense but grounded in 'excellency' and 'truth' rather than sentimentality. The preacher's tone is sober and analytical, which acts as a safeguard against the 'pre-chewed' emotions often found in Spirit-themed sermons. It takes the 'pain of brokenness' seriously as something that requires 'divine nature' to heal, not just a positive thought.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'Better Homes and Gardens' analogy flirts with kitsch but is used as a contrast to deeper relational change.",
      "The 'warm and wonderful thought' of Jesus praying is dismissed as insufficient, avoiding sentimental intercession."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the Spirit 'appalled' by our manipulation and addiction to approval.",
      "The use of the Charles Hodge 'Justice' argument to replace 'sentimental mercy'."

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is primarily opened through the 'First Advocate' section. By shifting the focus from the hearer's 'pleading for mercy' to Christ's 'demand for justice', the preacher removes the 'burden of performance' from the hearer. This is a classic 'Reframing' of grace. However, the space is somewhat narrowed in the final section on 'Obedience', where the tone shifts to 'Stop... stop...'. While intended to lead to grace, the imperative weight at the very end risks closing the 'Space' that the courtroom scene so effectively opened. The 'mystery' of the Spirit is respected, but the 'logic' of the sermon is very 'full', leaving little 'empty space' for the Spirit to act outside the preacher's categories.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'sinner' and 'loved child' is sustained through the 'star witness' metaphor.",
    "mystery_respected": "The Trinity is called 'dizzying' and 'mysterious', though the preacher quickly moves to explain its 'genius'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the 'Advocate' section, but moralization appears in the 'How to receive' section.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'infallible peace' of the First Advocate to be the final word, rather than the list of 'stops' in the obedience section."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.1,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high-quality example of 'Didactic-Aesthetic' preaching. Its beauty lies not in poetic flourish, but in the 'sober beauty' of clarity, theological depth, and psychological honesty. The preacher acts as a 'steward of language', carefully dismantling clichés to reveal the 'blazing heart' of the Trinity. The structural 'reframing' of the Paraclete as a 'friend who argues' is aesthetically and homiletically brilliant, providing a fresh 'optics' for a well-worn text. While the sermon leans heavily toward 'Logos' and 'telling', it creates a powerful 'event' of intellectual and spiritual reorientation. It avoids religious kitsch by grounding comfort in the 'hard' reality of divine justice rather than soft sentiment. The 'Space for Grace' is opened by the finished work of Christ, though the pedagogical closure is slightly too tight to be considered an 'open work of art'.",
    "strengths_top_3": [

      "The integration of psychological insight with biblical doctrine (the 'appalled' Spirit)."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase sensory imagery to move beyond purely cognitive/mechanical metaphors.",
      "Soften the 'three-point' pedagogical structure to allow for more narrative 'flow'.",

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Didactic-Analytical",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Witness' model of Thomas Long, with the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson (though more conceptual than sensory).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals most to urban, educated 'seekers' or 'skeptics' who value logic, psychological depth, and the deconstruction of religious clichés.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'showing' the Upper Room scene—the shadows, the smell of the bread, the fear in the room.",
      "Try an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer in the 'dizzying' space of the Trinity.",
      "Incorporate more 'musical' elements in the prose, such as longer, more rhythmic periods during the 'grace' sections."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically strong 'teaching-event'. It honors the Reformed tradition's focus on the Word while embracing the 'Aesthetic Turn' through its sophisticated reframing of reality. It is not 'kitsch' because it refuses to simplify the human condition or the divine response. While it lacks the 'poetic power' of a Grözinger or the 'openness' of a Stark, it achieves a 'transparency toward God' through its intellectual rigor and its insistence on the 'Space for Grace' provided by the First Advocate. It is a model of how clarity itself can be an aesthetic virtue in the pulpit."
