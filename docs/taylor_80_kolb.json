But I'm scared — ignorance makes me scared — to throw one of them away [...] The Lord will make a way; oh yes, he will. The Lord will make a way, somehow. Never mind about how if you know who. Love of the Lord Christ means that \"all things work together for good\" — as Paul assures us in Romans 8:28.",

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is grounded in highly relatable, sensory-rich experiences. It begins with a physical object (a jar of keys) and moves into the domestic and historical reality of the hearer. The preacher effectively uses the 'slice of life' technique, particularly through the lens of Mother's Day, to evoke universal feelings of vulnerability and the need for security. The identification with Peter's failure is not presented as a theological abstraction but as a human moment of 'warming himself by the fire.'",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher spends significant time analyzing the human condition, specifically the tendency to make excuses for spiritual cooling. He pauses to ask 'why' people drift from the church and explores the psychological defense mechanisms (blaming the preacher, the distance, or hurt feelings). He also reflects on the nature of maternal love as a mirror for divine love, contrasting it with the world's tendency to hold mistakes against individuals.",

        "When people talk about how they fall off from church... they give so many lies to us: 'The distance is too far.' 'There's something about the atmosphere...'",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The theological core is the primacy of love (agape) over performance or explanation. The preacher offers a clear 'big idea': love is the key that unlocks restoration. However, the exegesis is somewhat light on the linguistic nuances of the Greek text (phileo vs. agapao), though he does engage with Alexander Maclaren's interpretation. The theology is more relational than dogmatic, focusing on the person of Christ ('the Who') rather than the mechanics of atonement ('the How').",

      "analysis": "The sermon concludes with a strong emotional appeal and a call to trust, but the 'Active Experimentation' is more internal/dispositional than concrete/behavioral. While 'Feed my sheep' is the biblical command, the preacher translates this primarily into 'having something to say' to the despondent. The application is largely focused on the hearer's internal state of trust rather than specific outward actions for the coming week.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of narrative-driven preaching that prioritizes emotional resonance and personal testimony. It effectively utilizes the Concrete Experience phase by grounding the biblical text in recognizable human struggles—poverty, grief, and failure. The preacher's use of Reflective Observation is effective in deconstructing the excuses hearers make for spiritual apathy. However, the sermon falls short in the Active Experimentation phase. By intentionally pivoting from 'How' to 'Who,' the preacher provides spiritual comfort but offers little in the way of concrete, practical steps for the 'converging' learner. The theological conceptualization is clear but remains secondary to the evocative power of the stories told. It is a 'heart-heavy' sermon that serves the Accommodating and Diverging learning styles well but may leave the Pragmatic learner seeking more specific guidance.",

      "Experiment with sustaining a single metaphor (like the key) through all four phases of the cycle."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a highly effective piece of visionary and narrative homiletics. It succeeds in making the biblical text 'felt' rather than just 'understood.' From a Kolb perspective, it is an excellent model for the first two phases of the learning cycle, demonstrating how to move a congregation from a concrete situation into deep reflection. Its primary diagnosis is an imbalance toward the 'feeling' and 'watching' quadrants, which creates a powerful emotional experience but risks a lack of practical follow-through. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'Who' of faith and the 'How' of daily Christian practice."
