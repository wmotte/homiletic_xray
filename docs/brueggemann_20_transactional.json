Instead, it uses the Adult ego state to analyze a text that empowers the Free Child to be 'pesky' and 'cheeky' toward authority. It promotes autonomy by defining prayer as an act of hope and agency rather than a passive 'pious' duty. The preacher successfully dismantles the 'Victim' role of the widow, transforming her into a model of persistence.",
