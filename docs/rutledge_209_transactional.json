    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exceptionally healthy example of game-free communication. It utilizes a strong Adult ego state to dismantle the Critical Parent structures often found in religious discourse. By redefining 'Sin' as a condition rather than a list of failures, it removes the 'Gimmick' (guilt) that most preachers use to initiate games. The psychological impact is one of relief and cognitive realignment rather than emotional coercion.",

      "The academic tone might occasionally distance the Free Child of less intellectual listeners.",
      "Heavy reliance on Paul as the 'indispensable' authority could be perceived as a Parent-Child instruction if not for the Adult evidence provided."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'But Now' pivot to move listeners from passive victims of circumstance to active participants in grace. Maintain the distinction between 'The Person' and 'The Problem' (Sin) to prevent the Drama Triangle from forming."
