    "summary": "The sermon is intellectually stimulating (Adult) but psychologically coercive (Critical Parent). It utilizes a 'shame-based' entry point into the liturgy, where the listener is discouraged from having their own emotional boundaries (as seen in the critique of the woman who stayed away). By framing the fear of abandonment as the primary human motivator, it risks creating a dependency on the 'Rescuer' role of the church/theology rather than fostering true Adult autonomy.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Avoid using absent third parties as 'negative examples' to coerce the audience. Instead of saying 'this day is not for the faint of heart' (CP), try 'this day can be emotionally overwhelming for many of us' (Adult/NP), which allows the listener to own their feelings without judgment."
