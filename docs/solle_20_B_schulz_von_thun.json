    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The factual side operates on two levels: the exegetical narrative of the Emmaus disciples and a systematic-theological critique of modern epistemology. The preacher correctly identifies the 'Sache' not as a historical-positivist fact ('scientific proof'), but as a kerygmatic reality. However, the 'blue' side is heavily colored by a specific ideological framework. While the exegesis of Luke 24 is sound, the transition to political economy and global competition introduces a secondary factual layer that risks overshadowing the primary theological 'Sache'. The Barthian 'Living Christ' is present but is quickly translated into 'Life in its fullness' or 'Justice', which risks a horizontalization of the Gospel. The distinction between 'in echt' (positivism) and 'transcendence' is intellectually stimulating but demands high cognitive processing from the hearer.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a deeply integrated, reflective faith. There is a high degree of transparency regarding doubt and the 'twilight' of faith. The use of a personal anecdote (the granddaughter) is not narcissistic but serves as a 'diaconal' window into a complex theological concept. The preacher reveals themselves as a 'seeker' rather than a 'possessor' of truth, which builds significant credibility. However, there is a clear 'leak' of intellectual elitism in the critique of 'hochgelehrte Theologen' and 'technokratische Weltaufgeklärtheit'. The preacher identifies as a rebel against the 'status quo', revealing a personality that finds God in resistance rather than in traditional cultic devotion.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as a 'solidarity of the searching'. The preacher speaks 'at eye level' regarding the difficulty of faith. However, a 'paternalistic' (or maternalistic) tone emerges when addressing the 'rich world' and its 'crises of growing up'. The hearer is treated as someone who needs to be awakened from 'efficiency-obsessed' blindness. There is a significant 'relationship noise' for any listener who might work in the 'technocratic' or 'economic' sectors, as they are implicitly framed as 'enemies of religion' or 'blind'. The 'we' is often a 'we-the-enlightened-critics', which can exclude the average parishioner who feels part of the 'system' being critiqued.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The appeal is the engine of this sermon. The transition from 'Zuspruch' (the promise of the Risen One) to 'Anspruch' (the call to insurrection) is seamless but aggressive. The preacher explicitly states: 'Auferstehung ist immer auch Aufstand!' This is a classic 'Law/Gospel' tension where the Gospel (Christ is risen) is immediately turned into a Law of action (we must rise against injustice). While theologically grounded in the 'Mission Dei', the risk of moralism is high. The pressure on the 'dutiful listener' is significant: to believe in Easter is to fight against global textile slavery. The 'Zuspruch' is not a 'rest' for the soul, but a 'fuel' for the struggle.",
      "quotes": [
        "Auferstehung ist immer auch Aufstand! Resurrection is insurrection.",
        "An die Auferstehung Christi zu glauben heißt heute, gegen die Schändung des Lebens mit ihm aufzustehen.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a powerful, intellectually rigorous sermon that exemplifies the 'Political Theology' of the late 20th century. Communicatively, it is highly congruent; the preacher's 'Green' side (authenticity) supports the 'Red' side (appeal) with great force. However, from a strictly homiletical perspective, it teeters on the edge of 'moralism'. The 'Blue' side (factual/theological) is used as a springboard for social critique, which, while prophetic, risks losing the 'Sache' of the Gospel as a free gift (Barth). The 'Yellow' side (relationship) is somewhat strained by a judgmental tone toward 'the rich world'. The sermon succeeds in 'disrupting' the hearer but may fail in 'comforting' them, as the 'Zuspruch' is immediately instrumentalized for 'Aufstand'. It is a 'strong' sermon (7) for a specific audience, but 'satisfactory' (6) in its balance of the four sides.",
    "barthian_warning": "High risk of psychologization and horizontalization. God risks becoming a synonym for 'Justice' or 'Life-force' rather than the 'Wholly Other' who acts upon us.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Brilliant use of the 'in echt' metaphor to explain transcendence.",
      "High level of personal authenticity and vulnerability regarding doubt.",
      "Uncompromising relevance to contemporary global suffering."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce the 'relationship noise' caused by intellectual elitism.",
      "Allow the 'Promise' (Zuspruch) to stand longer before moving to the 'Demand' (Anspruch).",
      "Clarify the 'Blue' side: Is Christ a living person or a metaphor for social change?"
    ],
    "conclusion": "A rhetorically brilliant and theologically provocative sermon that serves the 'Truth' through 'Disruption', though it risks exhausting the hearer through its heavy 'Red' appeal."
