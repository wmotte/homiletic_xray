  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon centers on John 1:29. It attempts to find the 'unique' element of the text by focusing on the specific title 'Lamb of God'. However, it spends significant time on general liturgical observations and hymns rather than the immediate literary context of John 1.",
      "quotes": [
        "this reading contains the most singular of all John’s utterances: 'The next day, [John] saw Jesus coming toward him, and he said, ‘Behold, the Lamb of God...’'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Reduce the focus on the liturgical calendar and hymnody to spend more time on why John the Baptist *specifically* uses this imagery in the Fourth Gospel's prologue context."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates the required 'knowledge of the theology of biblical books' by linking the title to Exodus 12 and Leviticus. The distinction between the Passover lamb and the sin offering is clear and exegetically grounded.",
      "quotes": [
        "John the Baptist’s image combines the Passover lamb with a different lamb. In the book of Leviticus, the sin offering is described."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "While the Old Testament background is strong, the sermon lacks engagement with the Greek nuances of 'airōn' (takes away/lifts up) which Dekker’s requirement for Greek knowledge would invite."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding global events (South Africa, Mexico), meeting Dekker's demand for 'cultural philosophy' and 'sociology'. However, the application to the hearer's personal life remains somewhat vague and 'general' in the final third.",
      "quotes": [
        "The headline of the article is, ‘Where Killings Defiled a Church, No Forgiveness.’",
        "whether it is the bondage of apartheid or the bondage of addiction."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond global news reports to the 'zeitgeist' of the specific congregation sitting in the pews in Princeton."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a traditional 'block' structure: liturgical introduction, then exegetical lecture on Exodus/Leviticus, then contemporary examples. The 'present of revelation' where text and hearer converge is delayed until the very end.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let’s go back to the book of Exodus, chapter 12.",
        "Yesterday’s New York Times reports..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Integrate the 'misery' of the Mexican massacre directly into the 'exposition' of the sin offering rather than keeping them in separate sections."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is strong on 'misery' (the worm at the core, the violence of the 20th century) and 'redemption' (the substitutionary sacrifice). Gratitude is present but less developed as a distinct movement of the Spirit.",
      "quotes": [
        "Here and now, there is a worm eating away at the core of things.",
        "It should have been me, up there; it should have been you; but it was not. It was him."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Develop the 'gratitude' part more robustly as a response to being 'taken up' into the Cross, rather than just 'facing the truth about ourselves'."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon hints at the 'two ways' through the concept of judgment and the 'gloom of sin', but it avoids the sharp Dekkerian language of being 'lost'. It leans toward a collective 'lostness' in time rather than the individual's eternal destination.",
      "quotes": [
        "acknowledging our willingness to enter into judgment upon ourselves...",
        "there is no reason to think that the new millennium is going to be any different..."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. Christ is the clear 'telos'. The doctrine of the two natures (King, God, Sacrifice) is the backbone. Grace is presented as the only solution to the human predicament.",
      "quotes": [
        "A good preacher points away from herself to our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.",
        "The great High Priest has become the sacrifice."
      ],

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 18 minutes (1850 words), the sermon falls just short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. While it has substantive depth, the lengthy anecdotal introduction detracts from the 'breadth' needed for the text itself.",
      "improvement_point": "Shorten the anecdotal introduction about Christmas trees to allow for 3-5 more minutes of deep exegetical-theological 'breadth'."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a solid theological address that excels in Christocentricity but falls short of Dekker's formal requirements for length and interwoveness. It relies too heavily on a long anecdotal introduction and a 'block' structure that separates exegesis from application. The seriousness of the 'two ways' is present but muffled by a focus on collective historical misery rather than individual responsibility before God.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong dogmatic foundation regarding the substitutionary atonement.",
      "Effective use of biblical-theological categories (Passover vs. Sin Offering).",
      "Sober and realistic assessment of human 'misery' without sentimentalism."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Duration is below the 20-minute threshold for 'depth'.",
      "Structural separation of exposition and application makes the first half feel like a lecture.",
      "Initial 25% of the text is spent on anecdotal 'pre-talk' rather than the Word of God."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'strong' attempt (Score: 6/10) that functions as a sermon because it centers on the specific Word, yet it requires more 'breadth' and a tighter mixing of text and contemporary reality to fully satisfy Dekker's criteria."
