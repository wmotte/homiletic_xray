        "presence": "Medium",

    "risk_explanation": "The only slight risk of an ulterior transaction is the 'Bait' of acknowledging doubt only to eventually demand a 'Lord and God' confession, but this is handled with high transparency."

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The sermon avoids 'ITHY' (I'm Only Trying To Help You) by refusing to offer easy answers to the tornado tragedy. It avoids 'NIGYSOB' by validating doubt rather than punishing it. Authenticity is maintained through the preacher's admission of their own struggle."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon series is psychologically robust and game-free. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the 'Rescuer' role by refusing to provide simplistic answers to complex human suffering (the Alabama tornado). By speaking from an Adult ego state and validating the listener's 'Free Child' right to protest and doubt, the preacher fosters a climate of autonomy and authentic faith. The transition from the 'Night' of the Parent/Child struggle to the 'Light' of Adult revelation is handled with intellectual and emotional integrity.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of Adult-to-Adult transparency.",
      "Validation of the listener's emotional reality (grief, doubt).",
      "Avoidance of 'pious platitudes' (Rescuer behavior)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The critique of 'man-made gods' could lean into Critical Parent territory if not careful.",
      "Could incorporate more 'Free Child' spontaneity to balance the heavy 'Adult' processing of death."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' and 'us' to maintain the Adult-Adult level. Ensure that the 'Who' (the revelation) is presented as an invitation for the listener's Adult to consider, rather than a Parent's demand for the Child to submit."
