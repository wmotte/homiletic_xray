    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is rhetorically beautiful but psychologically regressive. It utilizes a 'Rescuer' dynamic that requires the listener to first accept a 'Victim' identity (the 'ragged wreck'). By dismissing Adult functions like philosophy and creed as insufficient, it creates a closed loop where the only health is found in total surrender to the Parent's (God/Preacher's) direction. This risks fostering 'Adapted Child' compliance rather than 'Free Child' spontaneity or 'Adult' responsibility.",

      "Heavy use of shame-based imagery ('ragged wreck', 'weird disease')."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Invite the congregation into an Adult-Adult dialogue. Instead of providing the 'only answer' to 'all ills,' present the text as a resource for the listener's own reflection. Reduce the 'Rescuer' framing by acknowledging that the listener has agency and existing strengths, rather than just 'bruised memories'."
