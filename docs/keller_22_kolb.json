    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively facilitates concrete experience by tapping into the universal human feeling of despondency. It avoids abstract definitions of sadness and instead uses visceral metaphors like 'dissolved' or 'crumpled.' The preacher connects the biblical text to the hearer's immediate reality by suggesting they will feel like they are 'on a couch talking to your therapist.' However, it lacks a specific, detailed narrative 'slice of life' story that would ground the experience even more firmly in a modern context.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher pauses to analyze 'why' this condition exists, looking at it from multiple perspectives: social, environmental, and physical. He avoids premature spiritualization by acknowledging clinical depression and the role of physical health. The analysis of why young people feel discontent is a particularly effective piece of reflective observation that challenges the hearer's perspective on their own life stage.",
      "quotes": [
        "There are some in whose cases it is clear to me that the cause of their depression is mainly physical.",
        "When you’re young, you don’t know how unhappy and discontent you are, because you’re sure that if you get a decent job... you’ll be satisfied.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The theological exposition is clear and logically structured. The preacher moves from the 'condition' to the 'root cause' (humanity's design for God) and finally to the Christological resolution. The exegesis of 'checed' and the first-person intensive pronoun provides intellectual depth. The 'big idea' is that human thirst is a cosmic reality solved only by Christ's desertion on the cross. While solid, it relies heavily on traditional Reformed categories which may feel overly familiar to some hearers.",

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides three 'cures,' which serve as the active experimentation phase. The advice to 'pray even when you don't feel like it' and 'talk to yourself' are concrete. However, the application remains largely internal and cognitive/spiritual. There are few 'external' action steps or ethical calls regarding how to treat others or change one's lifestyle, other than a brief mention of diet/medicine. It focuses on 'how to think' more than 'what to do' in the world.",

It provides a thorough, multidimensional diagnosis of the human condition (Reflective Observation) and a clear Christological solution (Abstract Conceptualization). It effectively uses the central metaphor of 'thirst' to create a bridge to the hearer's emotional world (Concrete Experience). However, the sermon is noticeably thin on narrative elements and external, communal application (Active Experimentation). It functions more as a 'theological therapy session' than a call to holistic life-change within a community. The structure is highly logical and clear, making it very accessible for intellectual learners but potentially less engaging for those who learn through story or external action.",

      "Use more 'Visionary' language to describe the 'holy mountain' and 'altar of God' in Psalm 43."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a highly effective 'Declarative' piece that provides significant intellectual and emotional clarity. It successfully moves the hearer from a state of 'feeling' to a state of 'understanding' and finally to 'hope' through the lens of the Gospel. From a Kolb perspective, it is a well-rounded learning experience for the 'Assimilating' and 'Converging' learner. To reach a 'model' status (8+), it would need to integrate the 'Narrative' quadrant more fully and provide more diverse 'Active Experimentation' steps that move beyond the internal cognitive realm. It is a sober, effective, and theologically sound piece of homiletic work."
