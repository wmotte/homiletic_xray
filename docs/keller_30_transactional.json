  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in moralistic preaching. It validates the human experience of loneliness (Child) while providing a robust framework for understanding it (Adult). By rooting the 'Critical Parent' (judgment of flaws) in the 'Nurturing Parent' (God's forgiveness), it reduces the listener's need to stay in an 'Adapted Child' state of hiding.",
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent distinction between 'User' and 'Friend' (Adult data processing).",
      "Validation of loneliness as a divine trait rather than a pathology.",
      "High transparency regarding the difficulty of friendship."

      "The transition to the 'Jesus as Friend' section could feel like a 'Bait and Switch' to a secular listener; more Adult-level evidence for this transition could strengthen it."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using the Adult-Adult transaction to define terms before moving to the theological application. This respects the listener's autonomy and prevents the 'Parent' position from becoming coercive."
