    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably game-free. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, inviting the congregation into a mature, reality-testing assessment of their cultural moment. By acknowledging the 'Trojan horse' nature of the sermon, the preacher avoids the 'Bait and Switch' game. The use of the Drama Triangle is avoided by shifting the focus from human helplessness (Victim) to the 'Living God' who empowers the 'nobodies' of the earth. The sermon promotes autonomy and personal responsibility rather than dependency on the preacher or the institution.",
    "strengths": [

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The use of Krummacher (Parental authority from the past) could occasionally overshadow the contemporary Adult analysis.",
      "Slight risk of 'Ain't It Awful' when describing the state of other denominations."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue the practice of 'naming the frame' (e.g., the Trojan horse comment). This meta-communication prevents the formation of ulterior transactions and maintains the Adult-Adult connection."
