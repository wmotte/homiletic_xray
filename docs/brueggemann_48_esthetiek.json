    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in 'reframing' abstract economic realities into sensory biblical images. Brueggemann uses the contrast between the 'sound and sleek' bodies of the wealthy and the 'pods that the pigs were eating' to create a visceral landscape of desire and despair. The imagery is not merely decorative; it serves as a 'rhetorical trigger' to move the listener from the 'slickness' of the market to the 'gravitas' of the sanctuary. However, some metaphors (like 'portfolio to portfolio') remain slightly more conceptual than sensory, leaning on the listener's socio-political awareness rather than pure poetic 'showing'.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise, characteristic of a 'stewardship of language' that avoids religious clichés. Brueggemann reclaims 'Canaanite' jargon by translating it into contemporary categories: 'portion' becomes 'commodity,' and 'sin' is reframed as a 'death script.' Every word is weighted; the use of 'barbed rhetorical inconvenience' and 'commodity enterprise' shows a high level of linguistic care. The precision lies in the naming of the 'aching ambivalence' of the modern believer, refusing to hide behind vague pieties.",
      "quotes": [
        "this barbed rhetorical inconvenience that questions the magic of the market",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a rhythmic, almost liturgical cadence. Brueggemann uses parallelism and repetition ('Until... until... until...') to build momentum. The structure of the sentences often mirrors the 'before and after' movement of the text, creating a staccato rhythm when describing the market and a more legato, expansive flow when describing the sanctuary and the father's welcome. It is clearly written for the ear, utilizing the 'sound value' of words like 'gravitas,' 'slickness,' and 'buoyant' to emphasize meaning.",
      "quotes": [
        "from strength to strength, from party to party, from portfolio to portfolio.",
        "Whom indeed in heaven but you: No one! What on earth, but you: Nothing!",

    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by a 'sober-reformed' beauty that rejects sentimentality for the sake of prophetic precision. The language is muscular and rhythmic, utilizing biblical imagery to 'refame' contemporary economic realities. Brueggemann’s stewardship of language is evident in his refusal to use tired clichés, instead opting for 'barbed' terms that provoke thought. The musicality of the text, particularly through repetition and parallelism, ensures that the 'how' of the proclamation reinforces the 'what' of the message."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'homiletical plot' based on the 'before/after' structure of Psalm 73. It begins with an 'upsetting of equilibrium' (the envy of the wicked) and moves toward a turning point: the 'until' of the sanctuary. The integration of the Prodigal Son story acts as a second movement that reinforces the first, creating a double-arced narrative. However, because it is structured as a series of numbered points (I-VI), it occasionally feels more like an essay than a seamless journey, though the internal energy remains high.",
      "quotes": [
        "Psalm 73 may be the model for all television commercials that are organized as 'before' and 'after'",
        "But then, beginning at verse 18, speaks a second voice... a contrasting voice",

        "The transition from Section IV to V is slightly abrupt.",
        "The numbered sections (I, II, III) can make the movement feel static.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. Brueggemann practices 'reframing' by placing the ancient text of the Psalm directly into the 'market-driven, war-hungering' context of the modern US. The synthesis is not forced; he respects the 'strangeness' of the biblical text while showing how its 'until' is urgently needed today. He avoids the pitfall of using the text as a mere springboard, instead allowing the text's own structure (the 'until') to dictate the critique of contemporary 'commodity ideology.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Clearly our nation has become a market in which everything and everyone is reduced to a tradable commodity",
        "The speaker is clearly willing to forego all of the commodities of his seductive neighbors",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is rhetorically powerful, it leans toward a 'closed' structure in its moral and political conclusions. Brueggemann’s 'either/or' (commodity or communion) is presented as a 'total and unqualified' contrast. While this is biblically faithful to the Psalm, it leaves less room for the 'ambivalence' of the hearer who must live within the market. However, the mystery of the 'until'—the fact that the preacher admits we 'do not know how it happened'—provides a crucial opening for the Spirit and the hearer's own experience.",
      "quotes": [
        "The contrast... is total and unqualified.",
        "The psalmist does not tell how it happened",

      "strengths": [
        "Admission of mystery regarding the 'turn' in the heart.",
        "The ending is an invitation to 'decide,' not a command.",
        "Recognition of the 'double-minded' nature of the speaker."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'either/or' could be softened to acknowledge the complexity of living in the 'between'.",
        "More room could be made for those who feel 'trapped' in the market without an easy 'until'.",
        "Avoid the 'total and unqualified' language to allow for more polyvalence."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent in its critique, but open in its pneumatology (the 'how' of grace)."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is defined by a strong narrative arc that mirrors the biblical movement from disorientation to new orientation. The integration of text and context is masterful, providing a 'reframing' of modern life through the lens of the sanctuary. While the structure is somewhat academic (numbered sections), the internal movement is dynamic. The sermon maintains a tension between the 'death script' of the world and the 'communion' of God, though it occasionally risks 'closing' the work through its sharp, binary rhetorical contrasts."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'pre-chewed' emotions and 'happy endings' that ignore the 'pain of suffering.' Brueggemann explicitly critiques 'promises of well-being... without the shadow of the cruciform.' He acknowledges the 'wearisome task' of faith and the 'aching ambivalence' of the pastor. There is no sentimentality here; even the 'Prodigal' story is stripped of its usual 'Sunday School' sweetness and reframed as a gritty 'decision grounded in identity.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None present; the sermon actively deconstructs kitsch (e.g., 'fantasy created by image-makers')."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [

      "The description of the psalmist as a 'brute beast' or 'jerk'."

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened precisely through the 'until.' By admitting that the 'turn' in the sanctuary is a mystery ('The psalmist does not tell how it happened'), Brueggemann leaves room for the unavailable action of God. He avoids 'moralizing' the turn as a human work, instead presenting it as a 'gift to be received.' The 'space' is the sanctuary—a place where the 'spell' of the world is broken not by human effort, but by a 'flash of understanding' or 'God's holiness.'",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between 'commodity' and 'communion' are sustained throughout, never cheaply resolved.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'how' of the 'until' is respected as a divine mystery.",

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.6,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'Prophetic-Imagistic' preaching. Its primary strength lies in its 'reframing' of the biblical text to confront contemporary socio-economic 'idols.' The language is precise, rhythmic, and carefully stewarded, avoiding the pitfalls of religious kitsch and sentimentalism. Brueggemann creates a 'space for grace' by focusing on the 'until'—the mysterious moment of divine-human encounter that disrupts the 'death script' of the market. While the structure leans toward the academic, the oral quality of the prose ensures a performative 'event' where the 'holy happens.' The sermon successfully moves the hearer from the 'slickness' of consumer envy to the 'gravitas' of covenantal communion, maintaining the 'sober beauty' characteristic of the best Reformed homiletics.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful integration of biblical 'reframing' with contemporary social critique.",
      "Exceptional stewardship of language and avoidance of religious kitsch.",

    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'mature' hearers, pastors, and students who are weary of 'kitsch' and seek a cognitively demanding yet emotionally authentic faith.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'open' ending that leaves the 'decision' in the hands of the hearer without the 'unqualified' binary.",
      "Incorporate more sensory 'showing' of the 'face of the crucified' to balance the economic analysis.",
      "Try a more seamless narrative structure that moves away from numbered academic points."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically high-quality 'open work' that respects the mystery of God's action while providing a sharp, precise critique of modern life. It avoids the 'easy comfort' of kitsch, opting instead for a 'wearisome' but authentic path to grace. It stands as a model of how the 'aesthetic turn' can serve the 'prophetic task' without losing the beauty of the Word."
