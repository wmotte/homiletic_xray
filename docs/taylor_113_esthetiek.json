    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Taylor employs imagery that is deeply rooted in the African American homiletic tradition, blending nautical metaphors with domestic and pastoral scenes. The imagery serves to bridge the gap between the mundane (fishing, breakfast) and the eternal (the welcome table). While some images are traditional, they are used with such personal specificity that they avoid becoming 'dead metaphors'. The 'nautical' imagery regarding the wife's role is particularly effective in 'showing' the stability of the deceased's private life. The transition to the eschatological imagery at the end follows the 'New Homiletic' principle of 'showing' heaven rather than merely defining it dogmatically.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is marked by a 'stewardship of words' (McEntyre). Taylor avoids the 'Canaanite' jargon of dry systematic theology, opting instead for a language of intimacy and dignity. The precision lies in the naming: he addresses family members by name, giving each a specific 'word' that justifies their relationship to the deceased. This is not sloppy sentimentality but a careful 'priestly' accounting of a life. The use of the word 'titular' at the start shows a sophisticated grasp of language, used here to humble his own office in favor of the friendship he is about to celebrate.",
      "quotes": [
        "Because I am a fellow pastor, I stand now in this pulpit; because I am a Christian, I come to witness his passing... but because he was my friend, I come to weep.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 9,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. Taylor is a master of the 'oral event' (Immink). The opening paragraph is a rhythmic masterpiece of anaphora ('Because I am...'), creating a cadence that moves from the institutional to the personal. The dialogue section ('Where is Shep?') introduces a staccato, conversational rhythm that breaks the formal eulogy style, making the sermon breathe. The ending uses a repetitive, 'legato' rhythm ('where... where... where...') that mimics the eternal rest it describes. It is clearly language written for the ear, not the eye.",
      "quotes": [
        "The jolliest of companions, the sturdiest of allies, the firmest of friends.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 8.0,
    "summary_language": "The micro-aesthetics of this sermon are characterized by a 'sober beauty' and rhythmic precision. Taylor avoids the trap of 'beautifying writing' by grounding his metaphors in the concrete reality of friendship and grief. His language care (McEntyre) is evident in the way he balances the dignity of the pulpit with the vulnerability of the 'fallen human form'. The musicality is not decorative but constitutive of the message: the rhythm carries the hearer from the shock of loss to the peace of the 'long home'."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry) that moves from the 'fallen human form' to the 'welcome table'. The 'upsetting of equilibrium' is the death of the 'Master-Friend'. The movement is not a static three-point argument but a series of concentric circles: from the national convention, to the local church, to the family, and finally to the private friendship between two men. The turning point occurs with the telephone dialogue, shifting the mood from mourning to a hopeful, almost playful anticipation of reunion.",
      "quotes": [
        "I come to weep and mourn over his fallen human form.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The integration of the biblical text (Ecclesiastes 12:5) is late but poignant. The sermon is primarily a 'witness' (Long) where the life of the deceased is the primary 'text' being read in the light of grace. The 'reframing' (Cilliers) occurs when the weariness of the friend is placed within the frame of the 'long home'. However, the biblical text serves more as a 'coda' or a confirmation rather than the structural foundation of the entire piece. The synthesis is organic because it arises from the friend's own last words, but it is less an 'exegetical' integration and more a 'thematic' one.",
      "quotes": [
        "In Mexico last winter he quoted to me in great weariness from Ecclesiastes.",
        "Philadelphia... he served your civic welfare as a priest at an altar.",
        "I know where Shep is. Somewhere where weariness does not come."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The biblical text is introduced through the voice of the deceased, making it deeply personal.",
        "The 'reframing' of death as 'going to his long home' is effectively handled.",
        "The connection between the friend's 'weariness' and the 'grasshopper' metaphor is touching."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The biblical text could have been woven more deeply into the earlier sections of the sermon.",
        "The 'priest at an altar' metaphor for civic work is a strong 'reframing' that could have been expanded.",
        "The transition from the 'Gun and Rod Club' to the 'safe port' of the wife is a bit of a jump."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "It reframes a public figure's death into a personal transition to a 'long home' of rest."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "As an 'open work of art' (Stark), the sermon succeeds by not over-explaining the 'mystery' of death. It leaves room for the 'ambivalence of existence'—the weeping remains even as the hope is proclaimed. The ending is particularly 'open'; it is an invitation to a conversation that hasn't happened yet ('talk and talk and talk'). It avoids the 'kitsch' of a closed, perfect ending by acknowledging the 'weariness' and the 'fallen form'. The hearer is invited into the friendship, not just told about it.",
      "quotes": [
        "I come to weep and mourn over his fallen human form.",
        "Old Partner, wait awhile.",
        "We'll sit at a welcome table and talk and talk and talk."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The ending is an 'open' invitation to future fellowship.",
        "The sermon acknowledges the reality of 'prejudice' and 'chill', not ignoring the world's pain.",
        "The preacher presents himself as a 'weeping' participant, not a detached teacher."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'I know where he is' could be interpreted as 'closing' the mystery too quickly for some.",
        "The list of family members feels a bit 'prescriptive' in its praise.",
        "More room for the 'silence' of death might have increased the aesthetic depth."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Polyvalent: it is simultaneously a funeral oration, a personal lament, and a theological witness."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are driven by a 'dramaturgy of intimacy'. Taylor moves from the 'titular' heights of the denomination down into the 'snug harbor' of the home and finally into the 'long home' of God. While the integration of the biblical text is more illustrative than foundational, the narrative arc is emotionally compelling. It avoids the static 'three-point' structure in favor of a 'witness' model that respects the 'event' of the worship service (Immink)."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Taylor avoids religious kitsch by grounding the sermon in the 'pain of suffering' and the 'fallen human form'. Kitsch offers immediate comfort; Taylor offers comfort through the 'weariness' of Mexico and the 'severest test' of a career. The emotions feel authentic because they are tied to specific, un-glamorized memories like 'breakfast in Boston' or 'fishing'. There is no 'happy ending' that bypasses the grave; rather, the grave is faced with the 'intrepid courage' of a real man. The 'welcome table' is a traditional image, but Taylor's use of it as a place to 'talk and talk' saves it from being a clichéd 'pearly gates' trope.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'schoolboy's ardor' is the closest the sermon comes to a sentimental cliché.",
      "The 'flowers bloom forever' sequence borders on the conventional, but is saved by the preceding mention of 'prejudice'."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission: 'I come to weep and mourn over his fallen human form.'",
      "The telephone dialogue: 'You can run, but you can't hide.'"
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the specific, gritty details of the life lived to prevent the eschatological hope from becoming a 'sentimental escape'."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon creates a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) by refusing to moralize the life of Marshall Shepard. He is not presented as a 'saint to be imitated' but as a 'friend who was loved'. Grace is found in the 'between'—between the 'titular head' and the 'weeping friend'. The mystery of God is respected by focusing on the 'inheritance' that is received, not earned. The 'welcome table' is the ultimate space of grace: a place of unhurried presence and dialogue.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'fallen human form' and the 'fullness of inheritance' is sustained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'long home' is described with poetic imagery that suggests more than it explains.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; there are no 'musts' or 'shoulds' in this sermon, only 'is' and 'will be'.",
    "recommendation": "The 'space' could be even wider if the 'severest test' of the career was allowed to show more of the deceased's vulnerability."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of the 'Black Homiletic' tradition, where the preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long) and the sermon is a 'performance' of hope (Immink). Its primary strength lies in its 'Poetic-Imagistic' style and its masterful rhythm. Taylor uses language not as a tool for dogmatic instruction, but as a 'stewardship' of memory and grace. The sermon avoids the 'kitsch' of easy comfort by acknowledging the 'weariness' of the human condition. While the structural integration of the biblical text is secondary to the narrative of the life, the 'reframing' of death as a 'welcome table' for 'talking' is a profound aesthetic and theological move. It opens a 'space for grace' by centering on the gift of friendship rather than the burden of morality.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rhythmic and musical use of anaphora and parallelism.",
      "Authentic, non-kitsch portrayal of grief and friendship.",
      "Vivid 'showing' of the deceased's character through specific anecdotes."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Deeper integration of the biblical text throughout the entire structure.",
      "More variation in the 'list' of family acknowledgments.",
      "Greater exploration of the 'tensions' mentioned (the public career test)."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Poetic-Imagistic / Narrative-Witness",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Gardner Taylor's own legacy, but aesthetically aligns with Paul Scott Wilson (imagery) and Gerrit Immink (performance/event).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to those who value 'sober beauty', emotional authenticity, and the rhythmic power of the spoken word.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'reframing' the biblical text earlier in the sermon.",
      "Use the 'dialogue' technique (like the phone call) more frequently to break formal structures.",
      "Continue to guard against 'sentimental' imagery by grounding hope in 'gritty' reality."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A high-quality aesthetic event that demonstrates how the 'aesthetic turn' can serve the 'consolatio' of the gospel. Taylor proves that 'how' one mourns a friend in the pulpit is inseparable from 'what' one believes about the resurrection. The sermon is a 'sober-Reformed' masterpiece of the African American tradition, using the beauty of simplicity and the power of metaphor to open a space where 'the holy happens'."
