    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' By operating primarily from the Adult ego state, the preacher respects the listener's autonomy. He uses the 'Free Child's' energy for celebration ('Brag!') but directs it toward socially constructive ends (Justice/Love). The inclusion of the preacher's own struggle ('Perhaps you are like me...') prevents a move into the 'Critical Parent' or 'Persecutor' role. The impact is one of invitation rather than coercion.",

      "The 'Justice' triad could be perceived as a new set of 'Parental' rules if not carefully grounded in the 'Free Child's' joy.",
      "Slight risk of 'Ain't It Awful' when listing city failures, though quickly resolved."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'we' to maintain the Adult-Adult transaction. Ensure that the 'steadfast love' triad doesn't become a 'Critical Parent' checklist by emphasizing the 'delight' aspect."
