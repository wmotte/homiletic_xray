    "psychological_health_score": 9,

Instead, it uses the Adult ego to confront the 'Victim' reality of death and decay (Ecclesiastes) before offering a hope based on external 'data' (the Resurrection). By sharing personal grief (brain tumor, aging parents), the preacher levels the hierarchy, moving from a Parent-Child dynamic to an Adult-Adult partnership in faith.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' to validate the 'Child's' fears. Avoid the initial 'Critical Parent' swipes at outside groups to keep the transaction purely focused on the shared human experience."
