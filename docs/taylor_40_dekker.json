    "sermon_start_end": "The event from which this text is taken occurs in each of the first three Gospels. We find a variation of the account in Matthew, chapter twenty, where there are two blind men at the outskirts of Jericho who cry out unto Jesus. [...] The Lord is passing through our Jericho on his way to the New Jerusalem to be crowned King of kings. Cry now, my soul, \"Have mercy on me.\" He will stop and give spiritual sight to each of us."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon begins with the specific text but quickly dissolves into generalities. It fails to identify what is unique to Mark 10 that cannot be found elsewhere. Instead, it spends significant time harmonizing the text with Matthew and Luke, which Dekker's thesis suggests is a distraction from the 'current, proclamatory word' of the specific pericope.",
      "quotes": [
        "Those who read all three of these accounts... will find more than one interesting detail.",
        "Coming in or going out! What does it matter other than that it happened?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the unique theological contribution of Mark's account (e.g., the specific naming of Bartimaeus as a disciple-in-the-making) rather than treating the text as a generic example of 'prayer'."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is a basic awareness of the geographical and historical context (Jericho's proximity to Jerusalem and the impending Passion), but it lacks depth in Greek/Hebrew nuances or the specific theology of Mark. The exegesis is subservient to a pre-determined theme of 'spiritual vision'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jericho is only about fifteen miles from Jerusalem. Jesus is moving very near to Calvary.",
        "Mark and Luke suggest that it happened as Jesus approached the city."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the linguistic analysis of Bartimaeus's cry ('Son of David') and the significance of 'throwing away his garment' in the context of first-century social status."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The application is largely psychological and moralistic. While it attempts to be concrete by mentioning 'western heels' and 'jeans', these are superficial cultural observations rather than a deep engagement with the zeitgeist or the hearer's spiritual reality before God. It relies on general truths about 'temptation' and 'spiritual vision'.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have seen aging men with bad feet trying to wear western heels and ladies in jeans...",
        "Temptation comes offering good times and shields misery behind its merry invitation."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond fashion critiques and general psychological types to address the concrete ways the modern hearer is 'blind' to God's specific calling in the present age."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a traditional 'text-then-lesson' structure. The exposition of the Jericho scene is largely completed before the preacher pivots to the spiritualized application of 'seeing ourselves'. The hearer is not drawn into the text so much as the text is used as a springboard for a topical speech on spiritual blindness.",
      "quotes": [
        "As Bartimaeus prayed for physical sight, so we need to pray for spiritual vision..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Integrate the application into the narrative of the text. Let the 'exposition' itself be the 'application' by showing how the text's specific movement 'expounds' the hearer."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon strongly emphasizes misery (sin, wretchedness) and redemption (Christ's blood), aligning with the Heidelberg categories. However, it leans toward a 'loathsome' view of man that risks becoming a 'general truth' of total depravity rather than the specific misery revealed by this text.",
      "quotes": [
        "When I see myself, I look at something loathsome and imperfect, self-centered and spiritually sick.",
        "Just as I am, and waiting not To rid my soul of one dark blot..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'misery' is the specific misery of the blind man in the text, not just a generic dogmatic assertion of human wretchedness."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon hints at the 'two ways' by mentioning the 'last chance' and 'final opportunity' for the congregation. It touches on being 'lost in time' (sin as a reproach to a nation), but the urgency feels more rhetorical than an existential confrontation with the destination of the soul.",
      "quotes": [
        "There is, also, some final opportunity, some last chance for all of us...",
        "He alone says, 'If any man thirst, let him come unto me...'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Sharpen the consequence of remaining 'blind'. The choice must be presented as a matter of ultimate life design, not just a missed emotional opportunity."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon explicitly rejects other 'saviors' (Moses, Socrates, Buddha) in favor of Jesus. It maintains a high Christology, though it occasionally slips into a sentimental 'Jesus and me' focus rather than the Trinitarian depth Dekker suggests.",
      "quotes": [
        "Not Moses... Nor Socrates... Not Buddha... Give me Jesus.",
        "Christ is his life. All of Scripture is the one garment in which the whole Christ comes to us."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'Son of David' title more robustly to the doctrine of the two natures to ground the emotional appeal in solid dogma."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1650 words, the sermon likely clocks in under 20 minutes (approx. 16-17 minutes). According to Dekker, this lacks the 'breadth' required for true 'depth'. The brevity results in a reliance on hymns and quotes rather than sustained theological labor.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical and theological labor to exceed 20 minutes, allowing the text's specificities to breathe."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily due to its lack of specificity and its brevity. It treats the Bible passage as an illustration for a general theme ('spiritual vision') rather than a unique revelation. While it correctly identifies Christ as the goal and man as a sinner in need of grace, it relies too heavily on general psychological observations and hymn lyrics rather than rigorous exposition of the Greek text and its unique place in Mark's Gospel.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christocentric focus, clearly identifying Christ as the only source of salvation.",
      "Effective use of the 'misery' category, avoiding a 'soft' or superficial view of human sin."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Fails the 20-minute threshold, resulting in a lack of theological breadth.",
      "Generalizes the text: the specific details of Bartimaeus are traded for a generic sermon on 'prayer' and 'vision'.",
      "Application is occasionally trivial (e.g., fashion choices) rather than being a concrete engagement with the zeitgeist."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an 'adequate' speech about the Gospel, but it is not yet a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense. It lacks the specific exegetical depth and the required length to truly 'recreate' the Bible passage into a current, proclamatory word."
