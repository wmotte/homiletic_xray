    "psychological_health_score": 8.5,
    "summary": "This is a psychologically healthy sermon. It avoids the common homiletic trap of using the Critical Parent to 'whip' the volunteers into service. Instead, it uses the Adult ego state to provide historical context and the Nurturing Parent to provide emotional support. By identifying Christ as the one who suffered the 'Night' alone, the preacher prevents a 'Rescuer' dynamic where the elders feel they must save the church by their own strength. The focus on 'praise' as a protective 'watch' is an empowering metaphor that invites the Free Child's participation.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-Adult teaching on the Hebrew context.",
      "Avoidance of guilt-based motivation for church work.",
      "Healthy use of imagery (the tent, the oil) to engage the Free Child."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the 'sin and blood' section (the cross) felt slightly formulaic (Adapted Child of the tradition) compared to the fresh imagery of the rest of the sermon.",
      "Could invite more 'Adult' reflection by asking the congregation how they specifically experience 'the night' today."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to frame 'duty' as 'response to grace.' To remain game-free, ensure that the 'Nurturing Parent' voice doesn't become 'Smothering'—allow the congregation to sit with the silence of the 'night' before offering the solution of the song."
