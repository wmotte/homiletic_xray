    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically 'warm' but structurally regressive. It utilizes a Nurturing Parent position to encourage a 'Gladly Adapted Child' response. While it fosters community identity and provides comfort (NP), it explicitly targets 'autonomy' as a negative trait to be 'broken' by the divine. This creates a dependency loop where the listener is told they cannot function 'under their own steam.' However, it avoids toxic shame and offers high levels of 'strokes' (blessing, joy, surplus).",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of positive strokes (blessing, abundance).",
      "Strong sense of historical and communal belonging.",
      "Uses the 'Adult' to explain the 'Action-Reflection' model."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The devaluation of 'autonomy' can lead to psychological passivity.",
      "The 'Ain't It Awful' dynamic regarding 'the world' creates an us-vs-them barrier."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation's Adult ego more directly by asking how they—as autonomous agents—choose to use the 'surplus' in the world, rather than emphasizing that their lives must be 'taken' and 'broken' to be useful."
