    "sermon_start_end": "We’re looking at the life of David, and this episode is a strange one for modern readers. It’s a strange one. One of the very first things David does after he becomes king is he wants to bring the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem. [...] No, because it just shows us Jesus Christ took all of that for us, and now your grace shines more brightly, your love becomes more real to us, and we can dance.",
    "notes": "The sermon utilizes a classic 'Gospel-centered' hermeneutic, moving from Old Testament narrative to New Testament Christology."

  "kolb_phases_analysis": {
    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins by acknowledging the 'strangeness' of the text, which serves as a hook to the modern reader's skepticism. However, it lacks a deeply immersive 'slice of life' from the hearer's contemporary world. The experience is primarily mediated through the biblical narrative rather than a shared human situation outside the text. The emotional connection is built through the contrast between David's joy and Michal's cynicism, which is recognizable in human relationships.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher pauses significantly at the 'problem' of Uzzah's death and David's reaction. He explores the 'why' behind the cultural norms of kingship and the psychological motivations of Michal. The sermon excels at analyzing the human condition through the lens of 'default settings' of worship, using David Foster Wallace to provide a cultural-philosophical perspective.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a robust theological framework. It moves from the specific rules of the Ark to the universal principles of God's holiness and grace. The exegesis of the 'mercy seat' (hilasterion) and the connection to the Ten Commandments provides a clear 'big idea': that biblical religion is unique because it bridges an infinite chasm through grace rather than human effort. The logical transition to the work of Christ is systematic and clear.",

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the sermon calls for a 'dance' and a change in 'worship,' it remains largely at the level of internal disposition. There are few concrete action steps for the hearer's Monday morning. The application is 'to believe the gospel' and 'to worship,' but the sermon lacks specific ethical calls or practical handles on how to identify and dismantle 'unconscious default settings' in daily life.",

It excels in the 'Assimilating' quadrant, providing a clear, logical, and Christ-centered framework for understanding the Ark of the Covenant. The use of cultural analysis (David Foster Wallace) and historical context (shame/honor cultures) provides excellent 'Reflective Observation.' However, the sermon is imbalanced; it prioritizes intellectual and theological clarity over practical application. The 'Active Experimentation' phase is largely relegated to an internal shift in perspective, leaving the 'how' of daily implementation unaddressed. While the 'Head' and 'Heart' are engaged through logic and narrative, the 'Hands' are given little to do.",

      "Use a 'Pragmatic' structure: 'Three ways to identify your default worship settings this week.'",
      "Start with a contemporary 'Concrete Experience' to ground the theology in the 21st century immediately."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a highly effective piece of theological teaching that will satisfy the 'Assimilating' learner and provide a solid biblical foundation for the congregation. Its diagnosis of the human condition as 'unconscious worship' is sharp and well-supported. However, from a Kolb perspective, it fails to complete the learning cycle with sufficient practical force. The priority for improvement is to move beyond 'thinking the right thoughts' about the Gospel and into 'practicing the right actions' because of the Gospel. It is a strong '7'—a well-developed sermon that serves as a good model for theological integration, but requires more pragmatic development to be truly holistic."
