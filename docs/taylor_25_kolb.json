    "sermon_start_end": "Some men sit in soft candlelight whose flicker rises and falls with each gust of wind blowing in from an open window. It is somebody's attic room, doubtless in one of the humbler homes in an undistinguished back street in the great city of David, Jerusalem. [...] At Calvary, there has begun a new fellowship. It is not confined to any one race, to any one section of the earth. It is the fellowship of all who have come to believe in the healing of the brokenhearted, in deliverance for the captives, in recovering of sight for the blind, in setting at liberty those that are bruised. This is the new fellowship begun by that cross.",
    "notes": "The sermon exhibits a strong mid-20th-century homiletical style, likely influenced by the Civil Rights era context, blending poetic imagery with social critique."

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon opens with a sensory-rich 'slice of life' from the biblical narrative. It avoids abstract theological definitions initially, opting instead for a cinematic reconstruction of the Upper Room. The preacher uses atmospheric details—candlelight, wind, attic rooms—to create an emotional 'hook.' However, the transition from the biblical 'concrete experience' to the hearer's contemporary 'concrete experience' is less direct, relying on the hearer's ability to map the 'quietness and peace' of the sanctuary onto the biblical scene.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Reflective observation is present in the analysis of the human tendency to prefer 'private dedication' over 'burning issues.' The preacher pauses to ask why we separate the 'blessed gospel' from the 'violence and ugliness' of the world. The reflection is more cultural and social than psychological. It identifies a problem—the 'pride of respectability'—but the exploration of 'why' this happens remains at a surface level of 'temptation' rather than a deep analysis of the human condition.",
      "quotes": [
        "What we forget is that the quiet and blessed scene to which we have referred was enacted under the immediate threat of cataclysmic and terrifying evils.",

      "analysis": "This is the strongest phase of the sermon. The preacher moves from the narrative to a robust theological framework: the 'New Principle of Judgment' and the 'New Pattern of Humanity.'

The 'big idea' is clear: Calvary is the ultimate judgment on human systems of power and the foundation for a new type of community.",

The application remains at the level of 'believing' and 'risking,' but does not provide a 'how-to' for the congregation. The ethical call is high-level and visionary rather than pragmatic.

    "overall_kolb_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of visionary-declarative preaching that effectively utilizes imagery and theological depth to challenge the 'respectability' of modern Christianity. It begins with a sensory-rich reconstruction of the Upper Room, successfully drawing the hearer into the emotional weight of the biblical narrative. However, it falls short of completing the Kolb cycle by failing to provide concrete, actionable steps for the congregation. The theological formulations regarding the 'New Principle of Judgment' are intellectually stimulating and logically sound, appealing strongly to the 'Assimilating' and 'Diverging' learning styles. The primary deficiency lies in the 'Pragmatic' task; the sermon identifies a need for a 'new fellowship' but does not equip the hearer with the specific ethical handles required to manifest this fellowship in a complex social world. The language is elevated and poetic, which serves the 'Visionary' structure well but may distance the 'Converging' learner who seeks practical utility.",

      "Strategic advice 1: Move from the 'what' of the cross to the 'how' of daily discipleship.",

      "Strategic advice 3: Conclude with a 'call to action' that is as specific as the opening imagery was vivid."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a rhetorically strong and theologically deep piece that excels in the 'Visionary' and 'Declarative' quadrants of the Homiletic Window. It successfully moves the hearer from a comfortable 'hymn-singing' posture to a more critical 'reflective' stance regarding the nature of the gospel. However, from a Kolb perspective, it remains incomplete. The lack of 'Active Experimentation' means the learning process is truncated; the hearer is left with a new vision but no clear path for implementation. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'skyline of the centuries' and the 'back streets' of the hearer's own life through pragmatic, servant-leadership-oriented application."
