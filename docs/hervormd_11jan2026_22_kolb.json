    "sermon_start_end": "Gemeente van Christus, je ziet het pas als je het door hebt. Zei Johan Cruijff ooit: \"Je ziet het pas als je het door hebt.\" Zo werkt het ook wel enigszins in het leven met Jezus en zijn Geest. We kunnen heel veel kijken, waarnemen, horen, maar vaak pas later [...] Dan wordt geloof geen dorstsysteem dat we in stand proberen te houden, geen bron die langzaam opdroogt, maar levend vertrouwen, verbonden met de vragen, de dorst van het leven hier en nu. Aanbidding in geest en waarheid. Ik zou leren open te vertrouwen dat Hij ons telkens weer opnieuw ontmoet, verrast en verfrist bij de bron. Amen.",
    "notes": "The sermon uses a Dutch cultural icon (Cruijff) as a hook and integrates a contemporary year-theme about the Holy Spirit."

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon attempts to ground the biblical narrative in concrete experience by focusing on the woman's shame and routine. However, it stays largely within the biblical world rather than bridging to the hearer's current concrete reality. The 'Cruijff' opening is a recognizable hook, but the emotional identification with the woman's shame remains somewhat descriptive rather than experiential for the listener.",
      "quotes": [
        "Maar het lijkt erop dat deze vrouw andere mensen probeert te mijden, en dat ze zorgt dat ze alleen bij de put is. Dat ze zo vol schaamte door het leven gaat.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The preacher could describe a modern 'well' or a modern 'routine of shame' to help the hearer feel the situation personally.",
        "The emotional connection is told ('she feels shame') rather than shown through evocative language that triggers the hearer's own experience."
      ],
      "homiletical_manifestations": "Hook in introduction (Cruijff), narrative reconstruction of the woman's daily routine, and the metaphor of the Australian farm."
    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This phase is well-developed through the exploration of the 'problem' of boundaries and identity. The preacher pauses to analyze the historical-cultural conflict between Jews and Samaritans, helping the hearer understand the 'why' behind the tension. There is a clear reflection on the nature of 'truth' as 'unveiling' rather than just factual correctness.",
      "quotes": [
        "Het is niet zomaar een theoretische vraag, maar dat is een identiteitsvraag. Waar hoor ik nu thuis?",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a solid theological framework, particularly regarding Pneumatology and Christology. The preacher connects the narrative to the 'I Am' statements and the theology of the cross (water and blood). The concept of 'worship in Spirit and Truth' is logically unpacked, moving from a local/physical understanding to a spiritual/universal one.",
      "quotes": [
        "Hij grijpt terug op die Godsnaam uit Exodus 3: ik ben die ik ben.",

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. The application remains largely internal and general. While there is a call to 'stay at the well,' the concrete action steps are limited to traditional religious activities (word, prayer, church) without specific ethical or daily-life implementation. The 'how' of living by the Spirit in a specific workplace or family situation is left to the hearer's imagination.",
      "quotes": [
        "En wat staat ons daarin te doen? Bij de bron blijven. Je laten verrassen. Vervullen bij de bron.",
        "Goed om zo deze dag en in deze week, in de alledaagsheid van het leven, van het werk, bij de put, door die Geest te leven."

        "The call to action is too vague ('live by the Spirit'). What does this look like in a conflict or a mundane task?",

    "summary": "The sermon is a solid, theologically grounded piece that effectively uses cultural and metaphorical illustrations to explain a complex biblical dialogue. It falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase, where the application remains largely internal and metaphorical rather than concrete and actionable. The preacher excels at 'Reflective Observation'—analyzing the historical and psychological nuances of the encounter at the well—and 'Abstract Conceptualization'—linking the narrative to high Christology and Pneumatology. However, the 'Concrete Experience' of the modern listener is not fully engaged, as the sermon stays primarily within the biblical world or within the realm of general 'routine.' The use of the Australian farm story is a highlight that bridges the gap between theory and practice, but it needs to be followed by more specific 'life-world' applications to truly complete the Kolb cycle.",

    "conclusion": "This is a well-crafted sermon that provides significant intellectual and theological food for thought. It successfully guides the listener through an analysis of John 4, offering deep insights into the nature of God and worship. From a Kolb perspective, it is a strong 'Assimilating' sermon that will highly satisfy those who learn through reflection and logic. To reach a broader audience and facilitate holistic transformation, the preacher should focus on making the 'Active Experimentation' phase more concrete and the 'Concrete Experience' more personally resonant for the modern hearer. The priority for improvement is the transition from 'understanding the well' to 'drinking from the well' in the specific, messy details of daily life."
