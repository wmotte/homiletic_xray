While it offers a beautiful description of the Trinity as self-giving love, it psychologically undermines the listener by insisting on a 'no health in us' identity. It creates a double-bind: God's love is unconditional, yet one must adopt a 'miserable' self-image to truly access it. This reinforces dependency and the Adapted Child ego state, potentially leading to religious shame rather than authentic Free Child joy.",
