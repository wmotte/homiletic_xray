    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a robust exegetical foundation, specifically focusing on the Hebrew 'ruach' and the active nature of the Spirit in the Old Testament. The distinction between 'spirituality' (as a human-centric noun) and the 'Holy Spirit' (as a divine-centric verb) is theologically sharp and Barthian in its emphasis on God as the Acting Subject. The inclusion of Calvinist Trinitarianism adds dogmatic weight. However, the 'blue' side occasionally becomes a lecture on biblical translation (e.g., KJV vs. NRSV), which, while informative, risks distancing the hearer from the immediate existential claim of the text. The 'Sache'—the living God—is clearly defined against human projections.",
      "quotes": [
        "The word for 'spirit' in Hebrew — ruach — also means 'breath' or 'wind.'",
        "God is a verb, and the Spirit of God is a verb.",
        "The Holy Spirit is the active power of God going out from God’s self."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong linguistic grounding of the concept of 'Spirit'.",
        "Clear distinction between human religious sentiment and divine revelation."

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. Complex Trinitarian concepts are broken down into accessible, albeit intellectually demanding, categories."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher exhibits a high degree of 'diaconal' self-revelation. By starting with a personal anecdote about a 'bad time' and a misunderstanding of 'spirituality,' the preacher establishes vulnerability without becoming the center of the sermon. There is a refreshing honesty regarding past failures (the admission of ignoring the civil rights movement). This 'leaking' of humility serves the message of grace. The preacher does not present as a 'spiritual giant' but as a fellow traveler who is also 'groaning inwardly.' The self-revelation is consistently used to point away from the self and toward the Spirit's power.",
      "quotes": [
        "I knew there was something wrong with it, but I wasn’t sure what.",
        "Most of us white Southerners — including myself, I am sorry to say — watched the whole thing take place and either ignored it or opposed it.",
        "May these inadequate words from this inadequate messenger be nevertheless for you today the Word of God."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive-Compulsive mix. The preacher seeks connection and harmony (Depressive) through a very structured, correct, and traditional theological framework (Compulsive). The 'Depressive' side shows in the empathy for the suffering, while the 'Compulsive' side shows in the need to correct 'vague' American notions of God.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is strictly subservient to the text; personal stories are used as windows into the doctrine, not as mirrors for the preacher.",
      "strengths": [
        "Authentic admission of historical and personal fallibility.",
        "Avoidance of 'Hysterical' stage-seeking."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'inadequate messenger' trope at the end can border on a 'Depressive' plea for reassurance if overused."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily one of 'Teaching Solidarity.' The preacher speaks 'at eye level,' often using 'we' and 'us' to include themselves in the critique of spirituality. However, there is a subtle paternalism in the 'corrective' tone regarding how Presbyterians view Calvin or how the congregation should view global issues. The transition to the 'geopolitical stuff' creates a brief distance—a 'yellow' signal of authority that might feel like a lecture to a listener in personal crisis, though the preacher recovers this by pivoting to personal pastoral care in the final third.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you’re like me, you find that the Holy Spirit is a much harder reality to grasp...",
        "Maybe there are a lot of you here who are not up for all this world-historical geopolitical stuff.",

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest theological strength. The preacher successfully resists the 'Appeal Ear's' demand for 'to-do lists.' The appeal is not 'do better,' but 'trust the Spirit who is already moving.' It is a classic 'Zuspruch' (Promise) sermon. The demand (Anspruch) is secondary: to 'discern' and 'decide,' but even this is framed as a response to God's prior action. The sermon avoids moralism by emphasizing that human 'spirituality' is a 'noun that just sits there,' whereas God's Spirit is the 'verb' that carries the believer.",
      "quotes": [
        "You are not saved by your spirituality... You have been and you will be saved by God.",

      "risk_of_moralism": "Very low. The preacher explicitly deconstructs the 'human potential' movement.",
      "strengths": [
        "Purely Barthian focus on God as the Subject.",
        "Liberating message for the 'exhausted' believer."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The call to 'make a decision' regarding global issues could be more clearly linked to the 'Zuspruch' to avoid feeling like a sudden Law-based insertion."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a sophisticated exercise in Trinitarian homiletics. It successfully navigates the tension between the 'Spirit' as a vague human experience and the 'Spirit' as the Third Person of the Trinity. By utilizing the Schulz von Thun model, we see a preacher who uses 'Green' (Self-revelation) not for vanity but as a bridge to 'Blue' (Dogmatic truth). The sermon is remarkably Barthian, placing the agency of salvation and prayer entirely on God (Immink's Acting Subject). The 'Red' side (Appeal) is handled with extreme care, ensuring that the congregation leaves with a sense of 'freedom and gratitude' rather than 'pressure and guilt.' While the middle section leans heavily into a teaching mode that might lose the 'Relationship Ear' of a less intellectually inclined audience, the pastoral 'landing' in the final third effectively re-establishes connection. It is a 'strong' sermon that avoids the pitfalls of modern psychologization by grounding experience in the 'Extra Nos' of God's Word.",
    "barthian_warning": "The preacher explicitly warns against psychologization ('human potential') and maintains God's sovereignty throughout.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological precision in defining the Spirit as 'Verb'.",
      "Vulnerable and diaconal use of personal narrative.",
      "Excellent balance of Law and Gospel, favoring the Promise."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Smooth the transition between geopolitical examples and personal pastoral care.",
      "Reduce the 'lecture' feel of the Hebrew word study.",
      "Clarify the 'decision' appeal to ensure it doesn't land as a new 'Law'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively honest and theologically rigorous sermon that serves the text with integrity."
