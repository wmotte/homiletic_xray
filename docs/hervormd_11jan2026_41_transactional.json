    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and demonstrates high levels of Adult-Adult communication. It avoids the common homiletical trap of using the 'Critical Parent' to shame the 'Adapted Child' into compliance. Instead, it uses the 'Nurturing Parent' to provide a safe framework and the 'Adult' to provide practical strategies for autonomy. The preacher successfully deconstructs the 'Slave' script of modern productivity and replaces it with a 'Free Person' script based on the Hebrew concept of Zakar.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize that these are 'experiments' rather than 'requirements' to keep the listener in the Adult ego state."
