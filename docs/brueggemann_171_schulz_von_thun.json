  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates a strong exegetical grasp of Psalm 90, moving beyond a mere surface reading to explore the structural 'fugue' of the text. The theological 'Sache' is the dwelling place of God (Barthian 'Heimat'). The preacher successfully connects the Old Testament lament structure with the New Testament command of love and the Pauline self-offering. However, the 'blue' side remains somewhat abstract in its definition of 'shalom'. While the exegesis of the word 'Turn' (v. 3 vs v. 13) is a brilliant factual highlight that illuminates the dialogical nature of faith, the sermon assumes a high level of theological literacy regarding 'Promethean environments' and 'penultimate' existence, which may create a barrier for some listeners.",
      "quotes": [
        "The rhetoric is like a large, stately fugue that sounds out the deepest sounds of reality.",
        "In verse 3 God called us to turn from our illusions. Now in verse 13 we call God to turn away from divine neglect.",
        "This news contradicts the market ideology all around us that requires us to qualify."

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals themselves as a 'reflective' and 'urbane' believer. There is a conscious attempt at authenticity when admitting to being 'fed up with the failure of God in the world.' This 'leaks' a sense of holy impatience. The 'I' is largely diaconal, serving as a surrogate for the congregation's own doubts and frustrations. However, there is a certain 'controlled' quality to the self-revelation; the preacher shares their 'fed-up-ness' in a very structured, almost intellectualized way, which prevents a truly raw 'Selbstenthüllung'. The preacher presents as a reliable guide who has already processed the crisis of mortality.",
      "quotes": [
        "Some of you, like me, are like the Psalmist, fed up with the failure of God in the world.",
        "I want to think with you about what happens as we take up residence there.",
        "This hard-nosed, contentious apostle has a human side; who knew?"
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Schizoid mix. The preacher seeks control through clear structure and intellectual distance, yet uses the 'Schizoid' distance to observe the world's 'Promethean' failures objectively.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching/Solidary'. The preacher uses 'we' extensively to create a sense of shared identity in the 'house of shalom'. However, there is a subtle paternalism in phrases like 'as we do over and over in our moments of sanity,' which implies the congregation is often 'insane' or 'deluded' by market ideologies. The relationship 'noise' comes from the high-level vocabulary, which may position the preacher 'above' the average listener. The 'You-message' is often a corrective one: 'Stop the arrogance.' While theologically sound, the yellow signal can feel slightly reprimanding.",
      "quotes": [
        "The news that I announce to you today...",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The appeal is twofold: a call to 'turn' (repentance/limitation) and a call to 'work' (love). The preacher successfully grounds the 'Anspruch' (demand) in the 'Zuspruch' (promise) of God as a dwelling place. However, the final section on 'work' risks sliding into moralism. While it mentions the 'free unconditional love' of Luther, the emphasis on 'sharing our own selves' and 'loving neighbor' is presented as a 'glad obligation' that could easily be heard by the 'Appeal Ear' as another heavy burden to carry. The 'Zuspruch' of the first half is slightly overshadowed by the 'Anspruch' of the second half.",
      "quotes": [
        "Stop the arrogance, because it is all very short term.",
        "The outcome... is a fresh readiness with work to do.",
        "The work we have to do is to share ourselves in the neighborhood."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The promise (God as home) is the foundation, but the demand (work/love) takes up the final third of the sermon's energy.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Moderate. The 'work' is defined against 'greed', which can feel like a moral checklist.",
      "strengths": [
        "The appeal to 'stop arrogance' is a powerful, liberating demand.",
        "Correctly identifies that the 'work' is a response to God's 'sharing'."

        "Reiterate the 'rest' of the dwelling place at the very end to ensure the Gospel has the last word.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a solid, intellectually rigorous sermon that excels in theological depth but struggles slightly with communicative 'closeness'. The preacher successfully navigates the tension between human transience and divine eternity, using the 'House of Shalom' as a powerful central metaphor. The analysis of the 'double turning' (God to man, man to God) is a homiletical masterstroke that bridges the gap between the 'Blue' factual exegesis and the 'Green' existential reality of the believer. However, the sermon leans heavily on the 'Blue' side, occasionally sacrificing 'Yellow' relational warmth for 'Compulsive' structural correctness. The transition to the 'Red' appeal (the work of our hands) is logically sound but risks becoming a new 'Law' if not carefully balanced with the 'Gift' of the Reformation. The Barthian 'Sache'—the acting God—is present, but sometimes obscured by the preacher's focus on 'market ideologies' and 'technological environments'.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a slight risk of 'psychologizing' the dwelling place as a 'moment of sanity' rather than a purely objective act of God's Grace.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Excellent exegetical insight into the 'dialogic' nature of the Psalm.",
      "Strong, consistent central metaphor (The House).",
      "Honest confrontation with divine silence and human mortality."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Simplify vocabulary to reduce 'relationship noise'.",
      "Increase the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) in the final application.",
      "Allow for more 'vulnerability' in the self-revelation."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A high-quality, 'Satisfactory to Ample' sermon that serves the text with integrity, though it remains somewhat 'at a distance' from the hearer's heart."
