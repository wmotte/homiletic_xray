    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The factual dimension focuses on the narrative of Acts 4, specifically the conflict between the apostles and the Sanhedrin. The preacher correctly identifies the historical-political tension: the 'managers of the Roman Empire' vs. the 'unauthorized movement.' Theologically, the 'Sache' is the Resurrection of Christ as a disruptive power. However, the analysis is somewhat reductionist; it translates the biblical 'priests and Sadducees' perhaps too quickly into modern categories like 'corporate life' and 'health care reform.' While this aids relevance, it risks losing the specific theological weight of the Jewish-Christian schism in favor of a general anti-establishment trope. The 'blue' side is clear but lacks exegetical nuance regarding the specific text of Psalm 23 mentioned in the title, which is entirely absent from the content.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a persona that is deeply suspicious of 'status quo' systems and 'managers.' There is a clear 'Selbstdarstellung' as a champion of the marginal. The preacher’s faith is presented as a form of 'empowered obedience' and 'energy.' However, there is little 'Selbstenthüllung' regarding personal struggle or the preacher's own location within the 'power structures' they critique. The 'I' is largely hidden behind a prophetic-didactic mask. The tone is confident, almost defiant, suggesting a preacher who finds identity in being a 'dissenter.'",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship to the congregation is primarily 'Teaching' and 'Mobilizing.' The preacher addresses the congregation as 'you' in the final section, inviting them into the story. However, the 'We-definition' is somewhat forced: the assumption is that 'we' are the ones who should be defying the 'status quo.' There is a risk of 'Relationship Noise' if members of the congregation identify as the 'managers' or 'administrators' the preacher critiques. The tone is paternalistic-prophetic; the preacher tells the congregation what they are ('You also are a child of the big wonder') rather than inviting them into a shared search for grace.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward 'Anspruch' (Demand). While it mentions the 'Gift' of Easter, the primary thrust is the call to 'enact mini-resurrections' and 'defy settled status quo arrangements.' The theological 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is used as a fuel for the 'Appell' (Appeal). In a Barthian sense, the Gospel here risks becoming a 'program for social change' rather than a 'proclamation of God's finished work.' The pressure on the 'dutiful listener' is high: if you aren't performing mini-resurrections or disrupting the status quo, are you truly part of the 'Easter guy's' movement?",

    "overall_communication_score": 5.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a vigorous example of 'Political Homiletics.' It successfully bridges the gap between a 1st-century text and contemporary social structures. However, from a Schulz von Thun perspective, the 'Red' side (Appeal) dominates to the point of overshadowing the 'Blue' side (theological depth). The preacher uses the Resurrection as a catalyst for human agency ('empowered obedience') rather than a space for divine rest. Theologically, it leans toward a 'Theology of Glory' where the Spirit is 'energy' and the church is a 'venue for resurrection.' The Barthian warning is pertinent here: God risks becoming a 'resource' for human social rehabilitation. The total absence of the cited Psalm 23 suggests a lack of 'Compulsive' care for the 'Blue' side, while the 'Hysterical' tendency to use the pulpit for a socio-political manifesto is present. It is a 'satisfactory' sermon for a specific activist context, but it lacks the 'diaconal' humility that allows the text to speak against the preacher's own ideological preferences.",
    "barthian_warning": "High psychologization of the Holy Spirit as 'energy' and 'courage' rather than the Third Person of the Trinity.",

    "conclusion": "A communicatively strong but theologically lopsided sermon that risks turning the Gospel into a moral-political imperative."
