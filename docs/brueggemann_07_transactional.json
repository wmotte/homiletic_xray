It utilizes the Adult ego state to process biblical data while inviting the Free Child to experience liberation. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Drama Triangle by refusing to play the Rescuer; instead, it 'authorizes' the listeners to take responsibility for their own presence and ministry. The use of linguistic 'weakness' as a metaphor for 'strength' effectively bypasses the Critical Parent's need for perfection.",
