    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The sermon maintains authenticity by avoiding the 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' (ITHY) trap. The preacher admits their own limitations ('The preacher is very limited'), which prevents the 'Rescuer' role from solidifying into a game."

    "congregation_position": "The congregation is positioned as 'Witnesses' or 'Children of God'—an autonomous and dignified position rather than a 'Victim' needing a human rescuer.",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, inviting the listener into a shared intellectual and spiritual exploration. By validating the listener's presence and suspected understanding, the preacher fosters autonomy rather than dependency. The move from the 'shriek' of Matthew/Mark to the 'completion' of John is handled with cognitive clarity, avoiding the common trap of using the crucifixion to induce 'Adapted Child' guilt.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of Adult-to-Adult transparency.",
      "Avoidance of the 'Critical Parent' voice despite the heavy subject matter.",
      "Healthy admission of personal limitations, preventing a 'Rescuer' complex."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The heavy reliance on intellectual data (Greek roots, Spurgeon) could potentially distance 'Free Child' emotional engagement for some listeners.",
      "Slightly more 'Free Child' spontaneity could balance the rigorous 'Adult' analysis."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'we' and 'us' pronouns to maintain the horizontal transaction. Ensure that the 'humility' regarding limited ability remains a brief Adult observation and does not slide into a 'Victim' plea for validation."
