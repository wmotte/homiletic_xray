    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in homiletics. By utilizing an Adult-Adult transaction, the preacher respects the autonomy of the listener. He avoids the Critical Parent position by identifying with the congregation's struggles (selfishness, pettiness). The sermon successfully navigates the tension between the 'Ideal' (Phil. 2) and 'Reality' (church fights) without resorting to guilt-tripping. The conclusion moves toward the Free Child's joy, making the 'Big Idea' of the Gospel feel like an invitation rather than a demand.",

    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Ugly People' metaphor is effective but requires careful delivery to ensure it isn't heard as a Critical Parent label.",
      "Slightly more 'Adult' data on how the 'mind of Christ' manifests in daily life could strengthen the application."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'we' instead of 'you' when discussing sin. Maintain the focus on the 'Big Idea' as a reality to be explored rather than a rule to be enforced."
