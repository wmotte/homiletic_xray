    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is heavily rooted in a Parent-Child dynamic. While it intends to be encouraging, it utilizes high-pressure metaphors (the dog in the trap, the Nazi occupation) that trigger the Adapted Child's fear and guilt. The preacher's self-identification as a 'gift' to the congregation reinforces a hierarchy that can discourage Adult-Adult accountability.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try using more 'I-statements' regarding your own Adult processing of the text. Instead of asking 'Don't you agree?', offer the interpretation and ask the congregation to 'weigh and consider' it in their own Adult ego state. Reduce the use of 'must' and 'should' to allow the Free Child to find joy naturally rather than as a commanded duty."
