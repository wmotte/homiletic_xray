[...] This table is precisely for the foolish, the weak, and the poor; those are the marks of new life and we bear them gladly."

    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on one specific passage. It treats Judges 12 merely as an illustrative 'hook' for a thematic exploration of 1 Corinthians 1, and then imports 2 Corinthians 8 to 'complete' a triad. It does not seek what is unique to the Judges text, but uses it as a metaphor for linguistic 'insider' status.",
      "quotes": [
        "I did indeed transport this third element to our text from 2 Corinthians 8, because it completes the evangelical triad."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates linguistic knowledge (Hebrew sibilants) and historical context regarding the Ephraimite-Gileadite conflict. However, the exegesis of the 1 Corinthians passage is somewhat generalized into a 'triad' of foolishness, weakness, and poverty, rather than a rigorous verse-by-verse exposition.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Hebrew alphabet has four sibilants: samek, stade, sin, and shin.",
        "The narrative concerns a conflict and eventually war between the Israelite tribe of Ephraim and the tribe of Gilead led by Jephthah."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exegesis of the Judges text. Why was this specific word 'Shibboleth' chosen? What does the brutality of the 42,000 deaths say about God's judgment or human sin in that specific context?"

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Application is present but tends toward sociological categories (Boomers, Depression babies) and general cultural critiques (race, environment). It lacks the sharp, concrete spiritual application to the specific congregation's life that Dekker demands.",

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured in blocks: first the Judges narrative, then the Pauline 'triad', then the contemporary application. The 'present of revelation' where text and hearer converge is hindered by this segmented approach.",
      "quotes": [
        "I tell you this so that we can read the text from Judges knowingly.",
        "Then I got to thinking: I wondered if the church might have a dialect..."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The themes of misery (our reliance on worldly power) and redemption (Christ's poverty/weakness) are present. However, the 'misery' is framed more as a 'mistake' or 'wrong sibilant' rather than a radical theological lostness before God.",

        "We have, moreover, done this rendering with the wrong sibilant long enough that it seems proper and faithful..."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "While the sermon mentions the 'deathly way of the world,' it lacks the urgency of the 'two ways.' The ending is somewhat soft ('we can... and we do!'), losing the tension of the ultimate possibility of being lost.",
      "quotes": [
        "God chose us... to offer an alternative to the deathly way of the world."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the reality of being 'lost in time' or 'eternity' more directly. The Judges text provides a terrifying image of being lost; use it to highlight the seriousness of the gospel choice."

      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is clearly Christocentric, identifying Christ as the 'telos' and the source of life. It correctly identifies the 'doctrine of the two natures' by referencing Christ as the 'wisdom from God.'",

      "findings": "At approximately 1450 words, the sermon likely clocks in under 15 minutes. According to Dekker/Miskotte, 'depth needs breadth,' and this sermon is too brief to achieve the necessary substantive weight.",

  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short primarily on its lack of focus on a single specific Bible passage and its insufficient length. It treats the Scripture as a source for a thematic 'triad' rather than allowing one specific pericope to dictate the message. While the Christological focus is strong, the application remains somewhat general and the sense of the 'two ways' is muted by a concluding tone that is perhaps too affirmative too quickly.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christological focus on the 'foolishness' and 'weakness' of God.",
      "Effective use of linguistic knowledge to explain the 'Shibboleth' concept.",
      "Clear rejection of worldly wisdom, power, and wealth as the basis for the church."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks focus on one specific pericope; 'transports' verses to fit a pre-conceived structure.",
      "Duration is significantly below the 20-minute threshold required for depth.",
      "Application relies on broad sociological categories rather than concrete spiritual realities."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an 'adequate' speech about biblical themes, but it is not yet a 'sermon' in the strict sense of Dekker’s definition. It lacks the specific focus on one passage and the necessary breadth (length) to achieve true homiletical depth."
