    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' It operates primarily from an integrated Nurturing Parent and Free Child position, inviting the listener into a state of trust and safety. By framing the Spirit's work as 'permission' rather than 'obligation' ('All of that is permitted!'), the preacher fosters autonomy rather than the typical 'Adapted Child' compliance found in many religious settings. The use of humor and vivid, non-dogmatic imagery keeps the Adult ego state of the listener engaged while speaking to the emotional needs of the Child.",
    "strengths": [
      "High communicative purity; no hidden agendas.",
      "Strong Free Child engagement through creative metaphors.",
      "Avoidance of the 'Bait and Switch' (Grace followed by Law)."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The Adult ego state could be further strengthened by addressing potential counter-arguments to the 'world is safe' claim (e.g., real-world suffering).",
      "Slight risk of 'Smothering Parent' if the dependency on the 'iron lung' is overemphasized."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'permission' language. To maintain this level of health, ensure that when moving into 'application,' you maintain the Adult-to-Adult stance, asking the congregation how they see these fruits manifesting, rather than telling them how they must manifest."
