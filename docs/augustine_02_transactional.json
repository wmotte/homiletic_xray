    "psychological_health_score": 2,
    "summary": "The sermon is a masterclass in psychological coercion. It utilizes 'fear-appeals' to bypass the listener's Adult ego and trigger a regression into the Adapted Child. While it theoretically points toward 'Love,' it spends the vast majority of its energy on the 'bridle' of punishment. The psychological impact is one of increased anxiety, shame, and a view of the Divine as an omnipresent Persecutor. It fosters dependency on the institution (the 'bishop') for safety from the very terrors the preacher creates.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Shift from 'Parent-Child' commands to 'Adult-Adult' invitation. Instead of 'petrifying' the listener into compliance, present the beauty of the 'Free Child's' authentic joy in God as a reality to be explored, rather than a reward for surviving a regime of fear."
