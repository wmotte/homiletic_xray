  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon identifies a specific passage (Sardis) but quickly pivots to general Easter themes. It fails Dekker's requirement of finding what is 'nowhere else' in this text, treating the Sardis letter primarily as a springboard for a general resurrection message.",
      "quotes": [
        "We turn today to look at Sardis... the fifth of the seven churches.",
        "That itself is a parable of life.",
        "I would say to you this resurrection Sunday morning that there are many forms of death."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Isolate the unique tension of Sardis—the 'name' of being alive versus the reality of death—and explore its specific ecclesiological warning rather than merging it into a general Easter hope."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates historical knowledge of Sardis (Cyrus, Croesus, the topography), which aligns with Dekker's requirement for humanities/history knowledge. However, the Greek/Hebrew linguistic depth is absent.",
      "quotes": [
        "It was the capital of Lydia and one of the most fabled people of wealth.",
        "King Croesus had reigned there.",
        "The fourth side was carefully guarded and fortified... when Cyrus and his Persian army came... they found a ledge."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the 'travelogue' history of the city to the specific theological exegesis of the 'white garments' and the 'book of life' mentioned in the text."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is a mix of the very general ('parable of life') and the highly specific political (Jesse Jackson). Dekker demands concrete application, but the political insertion feels detached from the text's own logic of 'watchfulness'.",
      "quotes": [
        "One sees many of our young people with their nervous systems under trauma and shock with drugs.",
        "If the nation wants, insists upon... a Caucasian president, then of course Jesse Jackson is not the candidate."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'nominal Christianity' of Sardis to specific, contemporary spiritual lethargy in the congregation rather than shifting to external political commentary."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a pattern of: Historical anecdote -> Spiritualized meaning -> Contemporary example. It lacks the 'one movement' Dekker seeks where the hearer is 'expounded' alongside the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "That itself is a parable of life.",
        "Well, there was a church in Sardis... but we do not know much about it, except..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid treating the history of Sardis as a mere 'illustration' for general truths; let the text's specific address ('I know your works') confront the hearer directly."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'misery' of being 'dead while living' is strongly developed. Redemption is present in the Christological finish. Gratitude is the weakest of the three in this specific text.",
      "quotes": [
        "The breathing dead... I would rather be physically dead than dead to interest, dead to purpose.",
        "God raised him from the dead, and he took the sting away from death."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'gratitude' section by explaining what the 'white garments' of the survivors in Sardis look like in terms of a life of thankful service."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is a strong point. The preacher emphasizes the 'awful peril' and the reality of being 'lost' or 'dead' to God's mercy. The seriousness of the human condition is not softened.",
      "quotes": [
        "You are of men most miserable because there lives in you a hope which is vain.",
        "A nominal Christianity is no good. In-name-only Christianity will not stand you in good stead in the swelling of Jordan."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Clarify the 'temporal loss' versus 'eternal loss' more sharply to avoid the sermon becoming purely psychological."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon moves from the 'dead' church to the 'living' Lord. The doctrine of the two natures is implied in the 'supralogical' authority of Christ.",
      "quotes": [
        "Only Christ can talk like that.",
        "The hinge is that God has raised Christ from the dead. If that did not happen, forget it.",
        "He had nobody but God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure Christ is not just the 'hero' of the Easter story at the end, but the active 'Lord' who is currently speaking to the church in Sardis."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 1950 words, the sermon likely clocks in just under 20 minutes. According to Dekker, it risks lacking the 'breadth' required for true depth.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical middle section to provide more 'breadth' before rushing to the Easter conclusion."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s ideal primarily by subordinating the specific Bible passage (Sardis) to a general Easter message. While it contains strong historical context and a serious tone regarding the 'two ways', it uses the text as a springboard for general truths rather than mining what is unique to Revelation 3. The political application regarding Jesse Jackson feels like an external imposition rather than an organic 'exposition-application' of the text.",
    "strengths": [
      "Serious treatment of the 'misery' of nominal Christianity.",
      "Strong Christocentric telos in the final third.",
      "Effective use of historical context to illustrate the 'thief in the night' motif."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specificity: the sermon becomes a general Easter sermon rather than a Sardis sermon.",
      "Application is occasionally disconnected from the text's internal logic.",
      "Duration is borderline insufficient for the 'breadth' Dekker demands."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'strong speech' that borders on being a sermon, but it lacks the rigorous specificity and interwoven exposition that Dekker requires. It treats the Bible passage as an illustration for a theme rather than the source of a unique, current Word."
