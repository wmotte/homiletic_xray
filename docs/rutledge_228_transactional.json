    "summary": "This sermon is an exemplary model of Adult-Adult communication in a homiletical context. It avoids the common pitfalls of religious manipulation by refusing to occupy the Critical Parent position. By framing 'Sin' and 'Death' as systemic/cosmic powers rather than individual moral failures, the preacher bypasses the listener's Adapted Child (guilt/shame) and engages their Adult (reflection/responsibility). The use of the Drama Triangle is consciously subverted by blurring the lines between victim and perpetrator in the Iraq War examples, which forces the listener out of easy moral superiority (NIGYSOB).",

      "High degree of reality-testing and Adult engagement.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Cosmic' scale might occasionally overwhelm the 'Free Child's' need for personal, spontaneous connection.",
      "The complexity of the Adult analysis may leave those in a 'Victim' state feeling a lack of immediate Nurturing Parent comfort."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' instead of 'you' to maintain the 'no distinction' Adult-Adult stance. Ensure that the 'Free Child's' joy is not entirely eclipsed by the Adult's intellectual rigor."
