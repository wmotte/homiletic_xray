    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The 'Sache' is the sovereignty of God as the acting subject in revelation. The preacher provides a high-level exegetical analysis of the Greek 'akoē' versus the Hebrew 'semu’a', arguing against translations that prioritize human 'hearing' (subjective) over the 'message' (objective/divine). The theological depth is significant, drawing on the Reformation tradition (Luther/Calvin) to correct modern anthropocentric tendencies. It successfully moves from linguistic detail to dogmatic assertion: God is not the object of our search but the subject who finds us. The content is intellectually rigorous but remains anchored in the Barthian 'Living Word'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Faith is awakened by the message, and the message that awakens it comes through the word of Christ.",
        "Paul’s Greek word akoē is semu’a in Isaiah’s Hebrew.",
        "God is the object to be sought, not the acting subject."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Precise exegetical correction of common translation errors.",
        "Clear distinction between 'fides quae' and 'fides qua'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The heavy focus on translation nuances might alienate a non-academic congregation (though appropriate for this specific audience).",
        "Could further bridge the gap between the 'message' and the specific person of Christ."
      ],
      "comprehensibility_check": "Appropriate for seminarians; likely too technical for a standard Sunday morning parish without further simplification."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a persona of a seasoned, somewhat weary observer of the ecclesiastical landscape. There is a clear 'Selbstenthüllung' of frustration with the current state of homiletics. The preacher positions themselves as an authority based on experience ('I have probably heard more sermons... than any other preacher'). This is not ego-driven but 'diaconal' in its intent to warn the next generation of clergy. There is a palpable sadness regarding the 'God-lessness' of modern preaching, which lends the sermon an air of prophetic gravity rather than mere academic lecturing.",
      "quotes": [
        "I speak with a certain amount of authority when I say that there are a lot of clergy out there who give every impression of not believing in God.",
        "What saddened me was that my luncheon companion knew this.",
        "I found the first incident amusing... and the second one just plain depressing."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Schizoid blend. The focus on 'correct' translation and the 'order of the sentence' (Compulsive) serves to maintain a theological distance from the 'hysterical' or 'depressive' focus on human feelings and spiritual journeys (Schizoid distance from the 'I').",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is used as a witness to the crisis of the church, effectively serving the text's demand for a return to God-centeredness.",
      "strengths": [
        "High degree of transparency regarding personal theological convictions.",
        "Use of personal anecdotes to illustrate a systemic theological problem."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The claim to 'unique' authority risks appearing elitist.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching' and 'Corrective'. The preacher speaks as a mentor to students ('beloved in Christ', 'entrusted to you'). There is a slight 'paternalistic' charge, as the preacher critiques the very 'spiritual journeys' the students likely value. However, the 'We-definition' is established through a shared concern for the integrity of the Gospel. The preacher challenges the audience's assumptions about their own future ministry, creating a tension that is intended to be 'healing' rather than destructive.",
      "quotes": [
        "I wonder about your reactions to the two incidents I mentioned.",
        "It is that news, beloved in Christ, which is now being entrusted to you.",

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The appeal is paradoxical: it is an appeal to stop 'doing' and start 'proclaiming'. The ratio of Zuspruch (Promise) to Anspruch (Demand) is expertly handled. The demand is not for moral improvement or spiritual effort, but for a 'theocentric' shift in perspective. The sermon itself performs what it asks for: it makes God the subject. The 'red' side is a call to surrender the 'spiritual journey' as a human work and trust in the 'performative word' of God. It avoids moralism by grounding the preacher's task in God's prior action.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s not about Noah! It’s about God!",
        "The emphasis is on what you can do, without reference to God [critique of false appeal].",
        "Faith is awakened by the message... the power that removes human 'spiritual' capacity to the margins."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The promise (God finds those who don't seek Him) is the absolute foundation for the demand (Preach God, not yourself).",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Very low. The sermon explicitly attacks 'spiritual' moralism and 'doing'.",
      "strengths": [
        "Clear directional force toward theocentric preaching.",
        "Theological liberation from the pressure of 'producing' faith in others."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The appeal could be more specific about how this shift looks in the 'messiness' of parish life.",
        "The ending is abrupt, leaving the 'how' of this entrustment somewhat hanging."

    "dominant_side": "Blue (Factual/Theological Content)",
    "disruptions": "A slight incongruence between the 'beloved' address and the sharp critique of modern clergy, which may cause 'relationship noise' for sensitive listeners.",
    "healing_disruption": "The 'It’s about God, stupid!' quote serves as a prophetic disruption, intended to shock the seminarians out of anthropocentric homiletics."

  "reception_simulation": {
    "the_factual_ear_hears": "I have learned that the Greek word 'akoē' refers to the objective message, not the act of hearing, and that my preaching must reflect this.",
    "the_relational_ear_hears": "The preacher seems disappointed in my generation of clergy and thinks our 'spiritual journeys' are a distraction from God.",
    "the_appeal_ear_hears": "I must stop preaching about human efforts and start making God the subject of my sentences.",
    "the_self_revelation_ear_hears": "The preacher is a seasoned veteran who is deeply worried that the church has lost its core message and is using their authority to sound an alarm."
  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a formidable sermon that functions as a 'homiletic on homiletics'. It is a masterclass in Barthian theology applied to the communicative act. The preacher successfully identifies the 'psychologization' of the modern pulpit—where God becomes an object of human experience—and counters it with a robust 'theology of the Word'. The psychological 'Green' side is disciplined and subservient to the 'Blue' theological task. While the tone is sharp and perhaps slightly elitist in its dismissal of 'spiritual activities', it serves a clear 'healing disruption' intended for a specific academic audience. The sermon's greatest strength is its congruence: it preaches about God as the subject while actually making God the subject of its own rhetoric. It avoids the 'appeal trap' by making the promise of God's acting presence the center of the message.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon is an antidote to psychologization. It explicitly warns against turning the faith into a 'spiritual journey' (Erlebnis) and restores God as the Acting Subject (Immink).",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Rigorous exegetical foundation.",
      "Courageous critique of anthropocentric preaching.",
      "Strong congruence between form and content."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Mitigate the tone of 'unique authority' to increase relational receptivity.",
      "Provide more concrete examples of 'God-centered' preaching in a secular context.",
      "Soften the dichotomy between 'spiritual disciplines' and 'God's action' to avoid total rejection of the listener's devotional life."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A high-quality, intellectually demanding sermon that achieves communicative integrity by aligning its psychological sides with its theological core."
