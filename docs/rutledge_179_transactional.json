    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Nurturing Parent' rhetoric used to deliver a 'Critical Parent' payload. It utilizes the Drama Triangle by casting the listener as a helpless, self-destructive child (Victim) and God/The Preacher as the Rescuer. While theologically traditional, it relies on the psychological 'Game' of making the listener feel fundamentally 'unhealthy' to make the 'mercy' feel more potent. This creates a dependency loop where the listener must feel bad to feel good.",

      "The 'Bait & Switch' from unconditional love to total depravity can be psychologically jarring."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation from an Adult-to-Adult position. Instead of telling them they have 'no health,' invite them to observe the reality of their lives and the 'here-and-now' effects of their choices. Move away from the Rescuer role by empowering the listener's own agency to respond to grace, rather than insisting on their total helplessness."
