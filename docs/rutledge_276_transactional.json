    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' By utilizing an Adult-to-Adult transaction style, the preacher respects the intellectual and emotional maturity of the congregation. He successfully bridges the gap between the 'Free Child' (the joy of the Epiphany/art) and the 'Adult' (historical and situational reality). The use of the 10th Mountain Division veterans serves as a healthy 'Nurturing Parent' function—validating the lived experience of an aging congregation and providing them with a sense of continued purpose (the 'watch') rather than infantilizing them.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-Adult engagement through art and history.",
      "Avoidance of the Drama Triangle; the preacher does not play the hero.",
      "High level of transparency regarding the sermon's intent."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the 'Silver Star' anecdote to 'battles against sin' is slightly abrupt.",
      "A brief moment of Critical Parent ('not to warm your heart') could be softened to further invite the Free Child."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements and personal reflections (like the Rembrandt anecdote) as they model an authentic, non-coercive Adult presence that invites the listener to do the same."
