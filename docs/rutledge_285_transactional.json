    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically sophisticated and largely healthy. It uses Transactional Analysis principles (even if not by name) to move the listener from an Adapted Child (legalism) to an Adult/Free Child position (joyful participation). The preacher's vulnerability about his own 'Parent' influences (Virginia honor) adds transparency, though it risks reinforcing a 'don't disappoint daddy' motivation for morality. The use of fear-based health examples for adultery is the only significant lapse into Critical Parent territory.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To be truly game-free, move the motivation for morality away from 'disappointing the Father' (Parent/Child) toward the 'intrinsic value of the neighbor' (Adult/Reality testing)."
