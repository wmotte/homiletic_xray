    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy, primarily operating from a Nurturing Parent position that seeks to energize the listener's Free Child. It avoids the common 'NIGYSOB' game of many religious texts. While it flirts with the Rescuer role, it ultimately empowers the listener by validating the reality of 'the long pull' and the 'light of common day.' The preacher successfully bridges the gap between high-energy ecstasy and the mundane reality of daily life without shaming the listener for their exhaustion.",

      "The brief dip into Critical Parent regarding 'cosmetics' and 'new marriage' felt like an unnecessary 'hit' on the listener.",
      "Could include more 'Adult' data on how one practically 'waits' in a modern context."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to define theological concepts (like 'waiting') in active, Adult terms to prevent the listener from slipping into a passive 'Victim' role."
