    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in visual 'optics,' a core value for Cilliers and Wilson. The preacher utilizes a cinematic metaphor—the crane-mounted camera—to help the congregation visualize the shift from local to cosmic perspectives. This 'wide-angle lens' is not just a decorative flourish but a structural tool to explain the lectionary's movement. The imagery of the 'stench' of history is balanced by concrete descriptions of cargo: 'costly wood, bronze, iron, and marble.' By invoking the 'Dies Irae' and the film 'Gone with the Wind,' the preacher anchors abstract judgment in cultural memory and sensory experience. The imagery effectively 'shows' the scale of God's judgment rather than merely 'telling' the doctrine of the Second Coming.",
      "quotes": [
        "We might imagine a movie camera mounted on a crane; at first the lens is focused on a small local happening... then the camera pulls back.",
        "The screen fills with one vast panorama of human suffering and death—the cost of war.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strongly weighted toward 'showing.' The preacher uses the cinematic crane shot to demonstrate the theological shift rather than explaining it abstractly."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Rutledge exhibits high 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre). She avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by explicitly deconstructing the word 'talent,' rescuing it from modern psychological clichés and restoring its original economic weight. The language is precise, particularly when navigating the tension between the Prayer Book's 'diligently expunged' phrases and the lectionary's 'magnification' of judgment. There is a clear, sober tone that avoids the 'beautifying writing' Grözinger warns against. However, the transition to the practical application of 'pledge cards' risks a slight drop in linguistic precision, moving from the cosmic to the institutional, though she attempts to maintain the theological link.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus is not talking about people being talented at drawing, or piano playing... He’s talking about money: shekels, francs, yen, marks, dollars—the green stuff.",

        "The phrase 'the green stuff' feels slightly out of place in an otherwise high-aesthetic register.",
        "The list of currencies (francs, marks) dates the text and could be modernized for continued precision.",
        "The transition to 'signing your pledge card' is a sharp rhetorical jolt that could be softened with more nuanced language."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "The preacher actively fights jargon. She takes the most 'jargon-heavy' concept (the Day of Judgment) and re-contextualizes it through film and poetry."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a rhythmic cadence, particularly in the sections where the preacher quotes Scripture and the 'Dies Irae.' There is a deliberate use of parallelism ('all Jerusalem, then all Judea, the entire Mediterranean') that builds momentum. The sentence structure varies effectively between long, descriptive 'wide-angle' sentences and short, staccato proclamations ('Be silent before the Lord God!'). The inclusion of the Latin poem provides a rhythmic 'heartbeat' to the center of the sermon, even for those who do not understand the language, creating a sense of liturgical gravity. It is clearly written for the ear, not just the page.",
      "quotes": [
        "Dies Irae, dies illa / Solvet saeclum in favilla / Teste David cum Sibylla.",
        "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!",

        "The middle section on stewardship becomes slightly more 'prosaic' and loses the rhythmic intensity of the opening.",
        "Some parenthetical asides ('not that there's anything wrong with that!') break the rhythmic flow.",
        "The conclusion could benefit from a more sustained poetic 'legato' before the final 'Amen'."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Oral language. The structure and rhythm are clearly designed for performance in a resonant space."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The sermon demonstrates a high level of micro-aesthetic care. Rutledge uses language as a tool for 'optics,' successfully reframing the congregation's view of the liturgical year through cinematic metaphors. Her stewardship of language is most evident in her refusal to let 'talents' remain a psychological cliché. The musicality is bolstered by the inclusion of the 'Dies Irae,' which lends the text a historical and rhythmic weight. While there are minor lapses into colloquialisms ('green stuff'), the overall poetics are sober, precise, and evocative of the 'sober beauty' valued in the Reformed/Anglican tradition."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a sophisticated 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with the 'dreadful day of judgment'—a phrase the congregation likely finds uncomfortable. The 'crane shot' provides the movement. The tension is sustained by the 'joke' of the lectionary bringing back what the Prayer Book tried to hide. The turning point (peripeteia) occurs when the preacher shifts from the terror of judgment to the 'best possible news' of liberation from money. The movement from the cosmic 'Day of Wrath' to the local 'Pledge Sunday' is a risky but structurally sound arc that forces the hearer to see their checkbook in the light of the apocalypse.",

        "The church’s theological clock starts to tick faster.",
        "So this is the first part of the sermon this morning. Where do we go from here?",

        "The 'change of pace' at the midpoint is a bit abrupt; the transition from Zephaniah to the Bruderhof feels slightly disjointed.",
        "The 'second level' of the parable of the talents could be integrated more smoothly into the cosmic narrative.",
        "The ending moves very quickly from the 'blaze of righteousness' to 'signing the pledge card,' which may feel like a 'drop' in dramatic tension."

      "plot_diagnosis": "Dynamic journey. It moves from the 'small local happening' to the 'entire universe' and back to the 'pledge card,' effectively reframing the local through the cosmic."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a masterclass in 'reframing' (Cilliers). Rutledge takes a contemporary, often mundane context (an Episcopal stewardship campaign in New York) and places it within the frame of 13th-century poetry, Hebrew prophecy, and the fall of Babylon. She respects the 'strangeness' of the biblical text—refusing to soften the 'Day of Wrath'—and then uses that very strangeness to reframe money not as a 'possession' but as a 'minus' or a tool for 'God's futures.' The synthesis of the 'Atlanta depot' from Gone with the Wind and the 'Day of the Lord' creates a new perspective on human suffering and divine intervention.",
      "quotes": [
        "One in particular seems fitting for the great city of New York: 'On that day... all the traders are no more.'",
        "We need to catch the larger vision of God’s plan... boldly to invest it in God’s 'futures.'",
        "The joke is that while the Prayer Book revisers were busy pushing the dreadful day of judgment out of camera range, the lectionary committees were bringing it back."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Authentic 'reframing' of money as an eschatological tool rather than a moral burden.",
        "Strong connection between the 'city of New York' and the biblical 'Babylon/Jerusalem.'",
        "Honors the 'otherness' of Zephaniah without making it irrelevant."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The comparison to the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima is a 'heavy' contextual link that could be explored with more nuance to avoid being merely provocative.",
        "The mention of 'tax deductions' is a very specific contextual detail that slightly 'grounds' the sermon too much in the present moment.",
        "Could further explore the 'New York' context beyond just the 'traders' metaphor."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes. It reframes the act of 'pledging' not as institutional maintenance but as an act of eschatological defiance."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is rhetorically powerful, it leans toward a more 'closed' structure typical of high-proclamation preaching. The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long), delivering a clear, authoritative interpretation. However, there is 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) in the way she acknowledges the difficulty of the theme: 'I don’t really understand why we are able to be of two minds about these things.' By leaving the 'Day of Wrath' as a staggering, hard-to-put-into-words claim, she allows the hearer to sit with the mystery. The ending, however, is quite prescriptive, tying the cosmic drama directly to the pledge card, which slightly 'seals' the work's polyvalence.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is hard to stand here and even try to put this staggering claim into words.",
        "I don’t really understand why we are able to be of two minds about these things.",
        "As you sign your pledge card today, the overarching vision is to signify that great day to come."

      "strengths": [
        "Admission of the preacher's own struggle with the 'two minds' of judgment.",
        "The use of imagery allows for multiple layers of emotional response.",
        "The 'joy of the Master' is presented as an invitation rather than a demand."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The direct link to the 'pledge card' at the end is very monovalent and 'closes' the interpretive space.",
        "The sermon could benefit from more 'open' questions regarding how the 'age to come' looks in the lives of the congregation.",
        "The interpretation of the 'talents' is very specific and leaves little room for alternative readings of that difficult parable."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent but with 'cracks' of mystery. It is a 'witness' sermon that seeks to persuade, but uses 'open' imagery to do so."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is highly effective. Rutledge avoids the 'static three-point' trap by creating a cinematic narrative arc that moves from the 'dreadful' past to the 'apocalyptic' future, finally landing in the 'stewardship' present. The integration of text and context is the sermon's greatest structural strength, successfully 'reframing' a mundane church activity through the lens of cosmic judgment. While the conclusion is somewhat 'closed' by its direct institutional application, the overall journey maintains a high level of tension and theological integrity."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is a profound rejection of religious kitsch. Rutledge explicitly mocks the 'watered down' versions of the gospel (the 'Pecan Festival' posters) and the 'tender-mindedness' that avoids the reality of judgment. She refuses 'cheap comfort,' insisting on the 'Day of Wrath' before moving to grace. There is no 'happy ending' that doesn't pass through the 'blaze of righteousness.' By using the 'Dies Irae' and the 'Atlanta depot,' she anchors the sermon in authentic human suffering and the 'staggering' nature of divine intervention. It is the opposite of 'pre-chewed' emotion.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'watered down' interpretation of talents as 'designing a poster for the Pecan Festival.'",

    "authentic_moments": [

      "The admission that the preacher 'recoils' from the imagery of stars falling and the sky darkening."

    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'cruciform' aesthetic that refuses to bypass the 'Day of Wrath' on the way to the 'Joy of the Master.'"
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace precisely through the 'reframing' of judgment. By showing that human systems (silver and gold) are 'incapable of rescuing' themselves, Rutledge creates a vacuum that only grace can fill. The 'Space for Grace' here is the 'Joy of the Master'—a liberation from the 'sickness unto death' of greed. However, the space is slightly constricted by the very specific 'pledge card' application, which risks turning 'grace' back into a 'task' (moralization). Yet, the 'vertical dimension' remains dominant: the Lord is coming from the *future* to set things right.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between the 'dreadful' nature of judgment and the 'best possible news' is sustained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'staggering claim' of the Second Coming is treated as a mystery that requires imagery rather than a problem to be solved.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails, but it is a 'costly grace' that demands a response (the pledge).",
    "recommendation": "To create more space, allow the 'liberation' aspect of giving to breathe more before attaching it to the specific institutional act of pledging."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.7,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high-caliber example of 'Theological-Imagistic' preaching. It successfully navigates the 'aesthetic turn' by treating the sermon not as a lecture on stewardship, but as a 'performance' of the liturgical year's crescendo. Rutledge uses the 'poetics of the lens' to shift the congregation's perception, moving them from a narrow, self-interested view of their finances to a cosmic view of God's 'futures.' The aesthetic quality is rooted in 'sober beauty' and 'stewardship of language,' particularly in the refusal to sentimentalize the gospel. The sermon avoids kitsch by staring directly at the 'Day of Wrath' and the 'panorama of human suffering.' While the structural move to 'Pledge Sunday' is a sharp descent from the cosmic heights, the preacher maintains aesthetic integrity by framing the act of giving as an eschatological practice—'practicing taking the long view.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "The 'crane shot' cinematic metaphor as a structural and perceptual tool.",
      "The rigorous 'anti-kitsch' stance that refuses to soften the 'Day of Wrath.'",
      "The masterful 'reframing' of the Parable of the Talents from psychology to eschatology."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The transition to the institutional 'pledge card' could be less abrupt and more 'open.'",
      "Modernizing the currency references (marks, francs) to maintain 'stewardship of language' for a contemporary audience.",
      "Softening the 'closed' nature of the conclusion to allow more room for the hearer's own 'appropriation' of the joy."

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Poetic-Apocalyptic / Sober-Reformed",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Four Pages).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to an educated, liturgically-aware congregation that values intellectual honesty and cultural depth.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'open' endings that leave the congregation in the 'mystery' of the future.",
      "Incorporate more 'sensory' language regarding the 'new life' and 'liberation' to match the intensity of the judgment imagery.",
      "Continue to use 'secular' art (film/poetry) as a bridge to 'reframing' biblical texts."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, aesthetically sophisticated sermon that serves as a model for how to handle 'difficult' biblical themes without falling into kitsch or moralism. It demonstrates that the 'how' of preaching—the cinematic lens, the rhythmic Latin, the historical panorama—is inseparable from the 'what' of the gospel. It is an 'event' where the 'holy happens' through the radical reframing of the mundane."
