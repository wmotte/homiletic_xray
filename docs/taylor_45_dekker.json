  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Hebrews 2:9 as a springboard, but quickly pivots to general themes of 'seeing Jesus' as a vision or ideal. It fails to isolate what is unique to this specific text versus other Christological passages. The tension between the 'not yet' (v. 8) and the 'seeing Jesus' (v. 9) is identified but treated as a general psychological comfort rather than a specific theological recreation of the Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "The writer of Hebrews says, 'We see Jesus,' and I say to you that this is the dearest sight a Christian can ever have."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus on the specific logic of Hebrews 2: why must the 'seeing' of Jesus happen specifically in the context of His being 'lower than angels' and 'tasting death'?"
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "There is a basic awareness of the connection to Psalm 8, but the exegesis is thin. The preacher relies on anecdotes (Louis XIV, Dr. Walker) rather than exploring the Hebrew/Greek nuances or the specific priestly theology of Hebrews. The original context of a persecuted or drifting community is replaced by general modern observations.",
      "quotes": [
        "Reaching back into the ancient Psalms, the writer is talking about what we men and women are created to be..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the specific theological argument of the author of Hebrews regarding the 'fittingness' of Christ's suffering as the pioneer of salvation."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete in its description of social decay and personal failure (the 'underclass', 'rot-gut wine', 'arthritis'). However, it often veers into general moralism (treating others well) rather than an application derived strictly from the 'tasting of death' in the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Go along the streets of almost any community and look into the dull eyes and sullen countenances of hundred and hundreds of men...",
        "Our problem is how we ought to treat others."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the concrete 'misery' of the street and the hospital bed more directly to the 'glory and honor' of the crucified Christ mentioned in the text."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a pattern of anecdote-text-observation. While not a strict 'block' structure, the application often feels like an illustration of a general truth rather than the hearer being 'expounded' by the text itself. The movement from the pyramids to the text is associative rather than expository.",
      "quotes": [
        "I was struck with the excitement in the voice of my friend... The writer of Hebrews says, 'We see Jesus'..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid using the text as a label for human experiences; let the text's own movement dictate the sermon's structure."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is strong on 'misery' (human failure, physical decay, social sin). 'Redemption' is present in the person of Jesus. 'Gratitude' is framed as 'good works' and 'prayer'. The psychological depth regarding human shame and failure aligns well with Dekker's requirement for human-oriented preaching.",
      "quotes": [
        "Do you not have memories in your life the mere recalling of which sends a hot flush of shame to your cheeks?",
        "We are making it somehow... but God knows we are limping through."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure 'redemption' is not just a 'sight' to behold, but an objective act (tasting death for every man) that changes the hearer's status."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon mentions 'losers' and 'corruption', but the 'two ways' (eternal or temporal loss) are not presented as a sharp choice for the hearer. It leans toward a comforting vision rather than a call to responsibility or a warning of being lost.",
      "quotes": [
        "We shall not ever see him fully here, but bye and bye we shall."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher should address the urgency of 'not neglecting such a great salvation' (Heb 2:3), making the choice for the 'narrow way' more explicit."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon moves toward Him as the only solution to human misery. The doctrine of the two natures is implicit in the discussion of Jesus being 'lower than angels' yet 'crowned with glory'. Grace is the underlying note.",
      "quotes": [
        "And the clearest vision we have of the divine nature is in Jesus Christ.",
        "If you need a Savior, see Jesus, see him on Calvary..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Sharpen the 'grace' aspect: it is not just that we see Him, but that He 'tasted death' for us—the objective substitution."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 18 minutes, the sermon falls just short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum for 'depth'. While it covers significant ground, the reliance on long anecdotes (Louis XIV, Dr. Walker) takes away from the 'breadth' of scriptural exposition.",
      "improvement_point": "Reduce anecdotal length to allow for deeper exploration of the biblical text's unique theological claims."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s ideal primarily in its lack of specific, text-driven exegesis and its failure to present the 'two ways' with sufficient urgency. It relies heavily on external anecdotes to generate interest rather than the 'recreation' of the Bible passage itself. However, it succeeds in its psychological realism and its clear Christocentric focus.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong psychological connection to human 'misery' and physical frailty.",
      "Clear Christological telos; the sermon consistently points to Jesus as the goal.",
      "Concrete contemporary imagery regarding social and personal failure."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient technical exegesis (Hebrew/Greek/Context).",
      "The 'two ways' (the possibility of being lost) is largely absent or softened.",
      "The sermon is slightly too short to achieve the 'depth' Dekker demands."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'satisfactory' sermon (Score: 5.5) that functions more as a thematic meditation on 'seeing Jesus' than a strict 'exposition and application of a specific Bible passage'. It lacks the sharp, specific 'truth found nowhere else' that Dekker requires."
