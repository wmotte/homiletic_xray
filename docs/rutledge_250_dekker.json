It has been borne in upon us lately that we no longer live in a Christian culture. We used to, but we don’t now. This change has taken place within my lifetime [...] for Jesus Christ is Lord and Jesus Christ has died and Jesus Christ is risen and Jesus Christ is—yes—coming again. AMEN."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Romans 14 as a springboard but quickly drifts into a general discourse on the zeitgeist and social ethics. It fails to identify what is unique to this specific text that cannot be found elsewhere. Instead, it imports Galatians 3, 6, and 2 Corinthians 4, 5 to do the heavy lifting, diluting the specificity of the Romans pericope.",
      "quotes": [
        "I found myself led to it by two things: today’s Scripture lesson from Romans, and the state of our society.",
        "And in Galatians Paul writes similarly...",
        "As Paul wrote to the Corinthians..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus exclusively on the logic of Romans 14:5-12—specifically the lordship over life and death—rather than merging it into a general 'theology of the cross' derived from other epistles."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is a basic awareness of the original context (factions in the congregation), but it remains superficial. The preacher relies on a secondary source (Achtemeier) rather than a rigorous engagement with the Greek text or the specific theological tension of 'days' and 'foods' mentioned in the passage.",
      "quotes": [
        "St. Paul, in today’s lesson from Romans 14, has in mind the tendency of his congregations to split into embattled factions."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exegesis of the 'weak' and 'strong' in Rome to explain why Paul insists on the non-judgment of specific ritual practices, rather than jumping immediately to modern racial politics."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Application is the sermon's strongest suit. It is highly concrete, referencing specific local events (the illegal parking incident, the arrest of the black student, the 'Rotting of the Big Apple'). It avoids 'general truths' by embedding the gospel in the grit of 1990s New York.",
      "quotes": [
        "The subway killing of Brian Watkins...",
        "Friday’s incident involving the young New Jersey woman who parked illegally...",
        "The police pushed him to the ground, handcuffed him, and carried him off in the paddy wagon."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application flows from the text's specific logic (the Lordship of Christ) rather than just using the text as a moral imperative for social justice."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is somewhat 'blocky.' It starts with cultural analysis, moves to a theological section on the cross, then to a long narrative application of a news story. The hearer is not so much 'drawn into the text' as they are shown how the text might be a useful lens for the news.",
      "quotes": [
        "Why am I saying these things this morning? It is not even Lent... But I found myself led to it by two things: today’s Scripture lesson from Romans, and the state of our society."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the 'sandwich' method. Let the exposition of the verse and the contemporary situation illuminate each other simultaneously throughout the sermon."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Misery is well-articulated as social 'rot' and 'nervous breakdown.' Redemption is placed outside the self in Christ's death. Gratitude is framed as 'service' and 'ambassadorship.' However, the misery is more sociological than theological (sin before God).",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s over for New York... New York is doomed.",
        "He took upon himself the judgment that would otherwise have fallen on us, and in so doing he redeemed the world.",
        "We are free therefore for service..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by addressing the individual's standing before the judgment seat of God (v. 10), not just the city's social collapse."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon flirts with the 'two ways' by mentioning being 'written off' or 'written in,' but it lacks the sharp Dekkerian edge of ultimate loss. It tends toward a collective 'reconciliation' that risks making the 'narrow way' feel like a social program.",
      "quotes": [
        "He was written off in order that all of us ungodly sinners might be written in—written in the book of life.",
        "Do not let anything you [do] be the ruin of one for whom Christ died."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Thematize the 'judgment seat of God' mentioned in the text more sharply. What does it mean to be 'lost' in the context of Romans 14?"
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon emphasizes the 'one Lord' and the doctrine of the two natures is implicit in the discussion of the Son of God's death. Grace is presented as the foundation of the new situation.",
      "quotes": [
        "In a time of drastically waning church influence, there is one thing that Christians have left... the name and the person of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
        "Real Christian faith issues forth in a readiness to shoulder judgment on behalf of others."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect Christ's Lordship specifically to the 'living and dying' mentioned in verses 7-9 of the text, rather than a general 'bearing of burdens'."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 18 minutes, the sermon falls just short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum for 'depth.' While it covers much ground, the theological depth is sacrificed for narrative illustration.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section to provide the 'breadth' required for true theological 'depth'."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s ideal primarily in its lack of textual specificity and its tendency to substitute a general 'theology of the cross' for the particularities of Romans 14. It functions more as a topical address on social ethics illustrated by Scripture than an exposition-based proclamation. However, it succeeds in its concrete application and its refusal to offer general, vague truths.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application: The use of the 1990 NYC context is sharp and avoids moralistic generalities.",
      "Christocentric focus: Christ is the clear goal and the only source of hope in a 'doomed' city."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of textual specificity: The sermon could have been preached from almost any Pauline text on the cross; the unique contribution of Romans 14 is missing.",
      "Sociological misery: The 'misery' is framed more as urban decay than as the theological condition of man before God's judgment seat."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a strong speech on Christian social ethics, but it is only partially a 'sermon' by Dekker's definition. It lacks the rigorous, language-based exposition and the specific 'nowhere else' quality required of a truly actualized Word of God."
