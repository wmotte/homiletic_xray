He said 'Till I come.' The Lord is coming... Maranatha! The Lord cometh!",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively connects the ancient text to concrete, recognizable situations for the hearer, particularly through the lens of social prestige and economic survival. The preacher uses the 'guilds' of Thyatira to evoke the experience of modern professional networking and the pressure to belong to 'prestigious organizations.' The emotional connection is strongest when discussing the dignity of the Black church and the personal anecdotes regarding voodoo and church politics. However, it lacks a singular, immersive narrative 'hook' at the beginning, opting instead for a geographical and historical introduction.",
      "quotes": [
        "One of the problems that minority people have had in dealing in business affairs in this country has been that they have not been where the business talk was being done in social settings in country clubs and whatnot",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Reflection is primarily achieved through cultural and social contextualization. The preacher pauses to ask 'why' the congregation values external secular success over their own institutions. There is a clear analysis of the 'problem'—the internal erosion of identity. However, the reflection on the biblical character of Jezebel remains somewhat detached from the 'why' of the congregation's current condition, focusing more on historical identification than psychological depth.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a solid exegesis of the historical setting of Thyatira and the biblical background of Jezebel. It formulates a 'big idea' around the necessity of holding fast to internal spiritual integrity. However, the theological exposition of the 'Son of God' title or the specific 'depths of Satan' remains relatively surface-level. The logic is more associative than strictly dogmatic, moving from history to social commentary to exhortation.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of contextual preaching that prioritizes the 'Diverging' and 'Accommodating' learning styles. It falls short in providing concrete, pragmatic 'Active Experimentation' steps, opting instead for a powerful visionary call to 'Hold Fast.' The preacher effectively bridges the gap between the first-century guilds of Thyatira and the twentieth-century social pressures of the Black American professional, creating a deep sense of 'Concrete Experience.' However, the theological 'Abstract Conceptualization' of the specific heresy in the text is somewhat generalized into a broader critique of secularism. The sermon is homiletically 'Visionary' and 'Narrative' in its primary thrust, succeeding in inspiring the hearer but leaving the 'how-to' of ethical resistance largely unaddressed.",

      "Use the 'Son of God' imagery to create a more robust 'Abstract Conceptualization' of Christ's authority."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a robust exercise in visionary homiletics, particularly effective in its descriptive-empirical task. It successfully completes the first three phases of Kolb's cycle for most hearers but stops short of the fourth. The priority for improvement is the development of the 'Pragmatic' window—converting the powerful vision of 'holding fast' into specific, actionable wisdom for the congregation's daily life. While the sermon is a model of cultural resonance, its diagnostic score reflects a need for greater balance between inspiration and application."
