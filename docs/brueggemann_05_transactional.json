    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and health-promoting. It utilizes the Nurturing Parent to provide safety and the Adult to provide reality-testing. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent (shaming the listener for their 'old tapes') and instead offers 'Permission'—a key TA concept—to move from the Adapted Child (stuck in old patterns) to the Free Child (joy and newness). The preacher successfully navigates the Drama Triangle by refusing the Rescuer role, instead acting as a 'Signpost' for the listener's own agency.",
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of Permission to release the past.",
      "Strong Adult-Adult appeal regarding global and personal reality.",
      "Avoidance of coercive 'Must' language."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The opening 'Con' (This sermon is not for you) is a bit 'gimmicky' and could be seen as manipulative by a highly skeptical Adult ego.",
      "The transition from global politics to personal guilt is swift and could benefit from more Adult-level processing."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize the listener's agency ('You may seize it'). To further strengthen the Adult-Adult transaction, you might invite the congregation to reflect on *how* they might practically 'notice' the newness in their specific Monday-morning context."
