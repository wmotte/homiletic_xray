While the social justice content is grounded in Adult reality, the delivery mechanism is primarily a 'Game' designed to maintain the preacher's moral superiority while keeping the congregation in a state of Adapted Child compliance. The threat of eternal damnation based on 'deeds' creates a high-pressure environment that discourages Free Child spontaneity.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Shift from a Critical Parent ('Shame on us') to an Adult-Adult transaction. Instead of shaming the congregation for indifference, invite them to explore the barriers to their own 'Free Child' enthusiasm. Replace threats of 'spewing out' with invitations to authentic agency."
