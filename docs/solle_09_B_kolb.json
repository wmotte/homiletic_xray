Der ganze Text der Verse 22 und 23 setzt voraus, dass »Licht in uns« ist, ja unser ganzer Leib »voll Licht« sein kann. [...] Das Licht, das in uns ist, das Licht dessen, der alles geschaffen hat: Wir sind beteiligt daran, eine neue Erde zu schaffen.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a mystical concept rather than a concrete life situation. While it eventually references the 'oil crisis' and 'inflation', these remain somewhat abstract categories of the 1980s rather than a vivid, sensory narrative. The identification with biblical characters is absent; the focus is on the reader's intellectual struggle with the text. The 'hook' is theological and linguistic rather than experiential.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher pauses at the 'difficulties' of the text and explores the human condition through a cultural-critical lens. There is a clear attempt to analyze 'why' the world is in darkness, linking internal perception (the eye) to external systems (capitalism/militarism). It effectively questions the status quo and the 'selective seeing' of the hearers.",

      "analysis": "The theological exposition is bold but highly ideological. The 'big idea' is the inseparable link between theology and economics ('Gott oder Kapital').

It effectively analyzes the 'blindness' of modern society and provides a clear theological framework (God vs. Capital). However, it falls short of a complete Kolb cycle. The Concrete Experience is replaced by abstract global statistics, and the Active Experimentation is lost in visionary rhetoric. It addresses the 'Assimilating' learner well but neglects the 'Accommodating' and 'Converging' learners who need stories and practical steps. The tone is sober and analytical, yet the lack of concrete application leaves the hearer with a 'vision' but no 'path'.",

    "conclusion": "The sermon is a powerful intellectual and prophetic challenge but an incomplete learning experience. It succeeds in 'opening the eyes' (Reflective Observation) and 'providing a map' (Abstract Conceptualization), but it fails to 'start the engine' (Active Experimentation). From a Kolb perspective, it is too theoretical. To move from a 5.5 to a 7 or 8, the preacher must bridge the gap between the 'New Earth' vision and the 'Monday morning' reality of the hearer. The priority for improvement is the development of the Pragmatic and Narrative quadrants to ensure the 'light' described becomes a 'lamp to the feet' in a practical sense."
