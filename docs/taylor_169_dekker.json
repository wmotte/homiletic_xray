If there are preachers who hear me this morning, as there often are in this congregation, they will sense something of what I mean. I do not say this in order to seek your sympathy. [...] Now unto him who can lift up what is fallen down! Now unto him who is able. Now unto him who is able to do and — here is some questionable grammar — \"exceeding abundantly (somebody has translated that \"superabundantly\") above all that we can ask or think,\" to him be glory and praise. He alone can make it all plain."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "While the preacher references Ephesians, the sermon is not an exposition of a specific passage but rather a thematic meditation on the 'magnitude of the gospel' and the difficulty of preaching. It jumps between Augustine, Paul, John, the Psalms, and Philippians, treating the Bible as a collection of 'wild words' rather than submitting to the unique logic of one pericope.",
      "quotes": [
        "I suppose that you could take nine brief statements and list the whole meaning of the entire biblical account",
        "The Bible itself tries to deal with this in language that sometimes escapes reason. For instance, there is the word 'He that seeketh to save his life shall lose it.'",
        "I read somewhere else in the Scripture that Christ says..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus exclusively on the internal structure and unique vocabulary of Ephesians 3. Stop treating the Bible as a reservoir of supporting quotes and start treating the specific text as the sole authority for the sermon's movement."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is no historical or linguistic exegesis. The preacher mentions 'questionable grammar' regarding 'exceeding abundantly' but does not provide the Greek context or the theological weight of the superlative. The original context of the Ephesian church is entirely absent.",
      "quotes": [
        "here is some questionable grammar — 'exceeding abundantly (somebody has translated that \"superabundantly\")'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explain the significance of the prayer in the context of the Ephesian letter. What did 'breadth and length' mean to a first-century audience? Move beyond personal 'frustration' to the historical-theological reality of the text."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The application is extremely vague and remains in the realm of general religious feelings ('disquiet', 'ennoblement'). There is no mention of the contemporary world, politics, ethics, or specific congregational life. It is a sermon about the sermon.",
      "quotes": [
        "this pressure that all of you feel sometimes in your life, this hankering, this disquiet, this edification, this ennoblement",
        "I have seen illiterate, backwoods believers aglow with what I'm talking about."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Replace abstract terms like 'ennoblement' with concrete examples of how the 'unsearchable riches of Christ' impact a specific modern situation or a specific human struggle in the congregation."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Because there is neither rigorous exposition nor concrete application, there is no interwovenness. The sermon is a series of rhetorical flourishes about the 'hugeness' of God, but the hearer is never truly 'expounded' by the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you use your mind alone, you will never grasp this gospel."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Stop talking *about* the gospel's difficulty and start *proclaiming* the text's specific content so that the application arises naturally from the exegesis."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon acknowledges 'humanity's fall' and 'born in sin,' but these are treated as theological data points rather than the background of the hearer's current misery. Redemption is present as a 'thrill' and 'grace,' but it lacks the specific trinitarian grounding Dekker requires.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Scriptures say to me that we were born in sin... I'm rooted in sin!",
        "By grace, you and I are to know the depth of God's love."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect. Instead of just saying 'we are born in sin,' describe the specific way this sin manifests in the hearer's world today to make the 'redemption' more urgent."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The sermon is almost entirely 'safe.' While it mentions 'perish' in a quote from John 3:16, there is no sense of the 'two ways' or the urgency of human choice. The preacher retreats into the Holy Spirit's work, absolving the hearer of responsibility.",
      "quotes": [
        "Anybody who is to be lifted up will not be so lifted by the preacher, but by the Holy Spirit."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the 'narrow way.' Address the possibility of being 'lost in time'—the failure to answer God's calling—as a serious consequence of ignoring the 'wild words' of the text."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the source of love and the one who descended into hell. Grace is identified as the means of knowing God's love. However, Christ functions more as a theme of 'hugeness' than the specific telos of the passage's logic.",
      "quotes": [
        "The height of Christ's love? How high is that?",
        "the boundless riches of Christ"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'riches of Christ' specifically to the doctrine of the two natures to show *why* this love is 'unsearchable' and how it detaches man from himself."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "At approximately 1150 words, the sermon would last roughly 11-12 minutes. According to Dekker (Thesis 8), this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for true depth.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the sermon to at least 20 minutes by including rigorous exegesis (Thesis 2) and concrete application (Thesis 3), which are currently missing."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls significantly short of Dekker’s criteria. It is primarily a meta-discourse on the difficulty of preaching rather than an exposition of Scripture. It lacks a specific Bible passage as its sole anchor, contains no historical-critical exegesis, avoids concrete contemporary application, and is far too short to achieve theological depth. It relies on rhetorical emotion and 'wild' abstractions rather than the 'true truth' of concrete reality.",
    "strengths": [
      "Adequate identification of the 'misery' of the preacher's inability to capture God's magnitude.",
      "Clear focus on the Holy Spirit as the necessary agent for revelation.",
      "Strong emphasis on the 'unsearchable' nature of grace."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specificity: The sermon treats the Bible as a collection of 'wild words' rather than a specific text with a unique message.",
      "Absence of exegesis: No engagement with Hebrew/Greek or the original context of Ephesians.",
      "Vague application: Fails to address the hearer's concrete world, remaining in abstract religious psychology.",
      "Insufficient length: At ~11 minutes, it lacks the 'breadth' Dekker demands for 'depth'."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is a religious speech about the 'frustration' of the gospel, failing the formal requirement of being an 'exposition and application of a specific Bible passage.' It lacks the necessary academic rigor and concrete urgency required for the 'present' of revelation."
