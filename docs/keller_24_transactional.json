By utilizing a strong Adult ego position to address the Critical Parent/Adapted Child dynamic (the 'abused child' vs 'neglected child' metaphor), the preacher promotes autonomy and emotional security. The use of Free Child imagery (fairy tales) provides a healthy emotional payoff without the need for manipulative 'switches.'",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' to explain the 'Parental' aspects of theology. This prevents the listener from slipping into a fearful 'Adapted Child' state."
