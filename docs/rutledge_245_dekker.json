The Wall Street Journal has been carrying on about this. A letter to the editor on Thursday quoted Horace Greeley: “Fame is vapor, popularity an accident, riches take wing. [...] The capacity to bear suffering for others comes to us by grace through faith in the One who keeps his promises and is waiting for us at our end. For the Lord Jesus Christ himself, by the power of the Spirit, is the content of our character. AMEN."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Romans 12:1-3 as a springboard for a topical discussion on 'character'. It fails Dekker’s requirement to find what is in THIS text that is nowhere else. Instead, it imports external definitions of character from MLK Jr. and secular sources, treating the text as a confirmation of a general theme rather than a unique revelation.",
      "quotes": [
        "What is character? Martin Luther King Jr. said...",
        "Someone said that character is what you have at three in the morning...",
        "We could fill many pages with descriptions of good character from secular sources..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the specific linguistic and theological tension in 'logikē latreia' (spiritual worship) that distinguishes Paul's 'living sacrifice' from general 'perseverance through adversity'."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is a brief mention of Greek terminology (hupomonē), but it is not linked to the specific exegesis of Romans 12. The preacher mentions the 'summer reading of Romans' but does not delve into the specific historical or theological context of the Roman church that necessitates this appeal.",
      "quotes": [
        "A key term in the New Testament is hupomonē, which is Greek for fortitude or endurance.",
        "St. Paul is saying something like this in the lesson from Romans appointed for today."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explain the transition from Romans 1-11 (dogmatics) to Romans 12 (ethics) to show why 'the mercies of God' are the specific ground for this transformation."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is highly concrete, referencing the 1996 presidential campaign, South African apartheid, and contemporary figures like Cardinal Bernadin. It avoids 'general truths' by naming names and specific political tensions, which aligns with Dekker's demand for concreteness.",
      "quotes": [
        "Does Bill Clinton have a good character? Does Bob Dole?",
        "In the interests of full disclosure, I am a Democrat...",
        "One of the most impressive Christians in America, Joseph Cardinal Bernadin of Chicago..."

      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application flows from the text's specific logic rather than using the text to comment on the news cycle."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured more like a thematic essay than an interwoven exposition. The text is quoted in blocks and then followed by illustrations. The hearer is not 'drawn into the text' so much as the text is used to label human experiences.",
      "quotes": [
        "Listen again to our text from Romans 12: [Block Quote] ... Don’t be misled by that renewal-of-your-mind phrase."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid block-quoting the text; instead, let the phrases of the text guide the movement of the contemporary illustrations."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The three parts are present. Misery is identified as being 'under the power of sin' and the lack of immunity to evil. Gratitude is explicitly named as the 'motive power'. However, the 'misery' feels somewhat secondary to the discussion of 'character' as a virtue.",
      "quotes": [
        "If it is true... that 'all human beings ... are under the power of sin' (Romans 3:9), then assuredly we all need a big-time makeover.",
        "So the motive power behind Christian transformation is gratitude."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by showing how even 'good character' can be a form of self-idolatry (the 'altar of self') apart from Christ."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on the 'two ways' through the contrast between the 'altar of self' and the 'altar of the mercies of God'. It mentions the possibility of destroying ourselves, but the ultimate seriousness of being 'lost' (temporal or eternal) is softened by a focus on 'peace' and 'admiration'.",
      "quotes": [
        "If we human beings got what we deserved, we would have destroyed ourselves by now.",
        "Christian lives are spent as living sacrifices, not on the altar of self, but on the altar of the mercies of God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'non-conformity' to the world more sharply as a choice between life and destruction, rather than just a 'better' way of living."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is identified as the 'telos' and the 'content of character'. The sermon correctly identifies that transformation is not self-improvement but being 'in Christ'. However, it flirts with moralism by focusing heavily on 'Christlike character' as a visible virtue before grounding it in the two-natures doctrine.",
      "quotes": [
        "Christian character, in other words, is cruciform—it has the shape of the One who was crucified.",
        "For the Lord Jesus Christ himself... is the content of our character."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly link the 'mercies of God' to the substitutionary work of Christ to ensure grace is the 'deepest of our life' rather than a psychological motivator."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1650 words, the sermon likely clocks in under 17 minutes. According to Dekker's Thesis 8, it lacks the 'breadth' required for true homiletical depth.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section to allow the text's own categories to challenge the contemporary examples more thoroughly."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s ideal primarily due to its topical nature and insufficient length. It treats Romans 12:1-3 as a thematic anchor for a discussion on 'character' rather than allowing the specific, unique voice of the text to dictate the sermon's structure. While it excels in concrete contemporary application (Thesis 3), it lacks the exegetical depth (Thesis 2) and the 'breadth' (Thesis 8) required to move beyond general truths about virtue.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application: The preacher avoids vague moralisms by engaging directly with the political and social zeitgeist of 1996.",
      "Theological grounding of gratitude: Correctly identifies gratitude for 'mercy' as the engine of Christian ethics."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length: Under the 20-minute threshold, sacrificing depth for brevity.",
      "Topical drift: The sermon is more about the concept of 'character' than the specific logic of Romans 12.",
      "Weak interwoveness: The text is used to illustrate the preacher's points rather than the preacher's points being an exposition of the text."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate speech on Christian ethics, but it is not yet a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense. It prioritizes the 'zeitgeist' over the 'specific Bible passage' and lacks the formal breadth necessary for the 'present of revelation' to fully emerge."
