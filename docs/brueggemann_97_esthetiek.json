    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily by modernizing the biblical characters into contemporary archetypes. Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' is partially applied through the vivid reimagining of the slave girl as a 'talk show' sensation and the owners as 'pimps.' However, the imagery remains largely sociological rather than sensory. While the 'quaking' and 'midnight' are mentioned, the preacher focuses more on the symbolic meaning of these images than on their sensory impact. The metaphors are effective for social critique but lack the poetic 'sober beauty' that Cilliers advocates for in opening a space for the Holy. It is more of a 'political optics' than a 'mystical optics.'",
      "quotes": [
        "You can imagine her as a sensation making the rounds of the talk shows",
        "The money men are often just pimps who exploit and use others to cash in",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise and avoids traditional 'Canaanite' jargon, opting instead for a sharp, contemporary vocabulary. In line with McEntyre’s stewardship of language, the preacher uses words like 'pimp,' 'status quo,' and 'Orange Alert' to shock the hearer out of religious complacency. There is a clear effort to define salvation not as a 'ticket to heaven' but as being 'in sync with the rule of God.' This precision helps in 'reframing' reality. However, the use of politically charged terms like 'tea party' or 'activist judges' risks dating the sermon and potentially alienating the hearer through over-generalization.",
      "quotes": [
        "Proclaim to you a way of salvation, not about how to get to heaven, but how to be in sync with the rule of God",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a strong rhetorical rhythm, particularly in the later sections. The use of parallel structures ('His life is no longer...') creates a liturgical cadence that mirrors the 'singing' of Paul and Silas. The variation in sentence length—moving from descriptive prose to staccato declarations of the gospel—suggests an oral awareness. It avoids 'paper language' by using direct, confrontational addresses. The ending, with its rhythmic contrast of 'life over death' and 'freedom over fear,' provides a musical resolution that sticks with the hearer, fulfilling Immink's idea of the sermon as a performative event.",
      "quotes": [
        "At midnight something new broke loose in the world.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 6.67,
    "summary_language": "The language is rhetorically sharp and contemporary, successfully avoiding religious kitsch through the use of provocative, secularized metaphors. It prioritizes 'reframing' the social reality over traditional poetic beauty. While the imagery is more sociological than sensory, the rhythmic structure and precise word choice create a compelling 'performance' of the text. It functions as a 'prophetic' aesthetic that seeks to unsettle rather than merely comfort, using language as a tool for social and spiritual reorientation."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' as described by Lowry. It begins by establishing a 'social crisis' (the upsetting of equilibrium), moves through the 'darkness' of the prison, and reaches a turning point at 'midnight.' The movement from the 'five ingredients of fear' to the 'alternative way' of the jailer provides a palpable sense of progression. The preacher successfully maintains tension by focusing on the jailer's internal transformation rather than just the external earthquake. The conclusion offers a resolution (hospitality) without ignoring the ongoing 'Orange Alert' of the world, sustaining the 'already/not yet' tension Cilliers describes.",
      "quotes": [
        "The story contains all of the ingredients of a society that is frightened and anxious",
        "And then, abruptly, there was a quaking, a shaking of the jail",
        "The story ends in hospitality. He feeds them; he cares for their wounds"

        "Clear movement from a 'map of fear' to a 'map of grace'.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition between the list in Part I and the narrative in Part II could be more organic.",
        "The 'imagined' questions of the jailer are a bit long and could be tightened to maintain pace.",
        "The connection to Psalm 97 is mentioned in the title but not integrated into the narrative arc."

      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey from the 'prison of the status quo' to the 'freedom of the gospel'."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. The 'reframing' (Cilliers) of the Acts narrative within the context of modern consumerism, media, and politics is masterful. The preacher does not simply 'apply' the text; he allows the text to interrogate the modern world. The 'money men' and 'magistrates' are not just historical figures but active forces in the hearer's reality. The synthesis is organic because it identifies the underlying 'demons' (greed, fear) that remain constant. It respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the singing in prison) while making it an urgent 'alternative' for today.",
      "quotes": [
        "His life is no longer determined by talk-show fortune tellers who rob us of freedom",
        "The magistrates want to keep us on Orange Alert. But the Jesus people refuse.",

        "Successful 'reframing' of salvation as a social and economic alternative.",
        "Honors the radicality of the biblical text without domesticating it."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The mention of 'tea party' and 'Supreme Court' might be too specific, potentially dating the 'reframing'.",
        "Could explore the 'strangeness' of the earthquake more as a divine 'interruption'.",
        "Stronger link to the Easter context mentioned in the introduction."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "The sermon offers a powerful new frame: the gospel as a counter-cultural movement of joy against a culture of fear."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is rhetorically powerful, it leans toward a 'closed' structure in its social critique. The preacher provides a very specific interpretation of who the 'money men' and 'magistrates' are today. According to Stark’s 'open work of art,' this could be seen as 'sealing' the text within a specific political framework. However, the ending—'What a strange bunch we are!'—reopens the space by inviting the hearer into a new identity rather than just a new set of rules. It acknowledges the 'ambivalence' of living in a world that is still on 'Orange Alert' while trying to sing hymns.",
      "quotes": [
        "The story invites us to think again about our commitments, our fears, and our hopes.",
        "What a strange bunch we are!",
        "Now it is defined by Easter news of life over death"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The ending is an invitation to an 'alternative way' rather than a moralistic checklist.",
        "Leaves room for the hearer to identify their own 'prisons'.",
        "The 'midnight' setting maintains a sense of mystery."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Reduce the prescriptive nature of the social categories to allow for more 'polyvalence'.",
        "Allow the 'questions' of the jailer to remain more open for the congregation to answer.",
        "Avoid 'forcing' the interpretation of the slave girl solely as a media star."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly closed through specific social commentary, but reopened at the end through a call to identity."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon possesses a strong, dynamic dramaturgy that moves effectively from the diagnosis of a 'fearful society' to the 'buoyant generosity' of the gospel. Its primary strength lies in the creative 'reframing' of the text, making the ancient story feel like a contemporary social crisis. While the structure is somewhat 'closed' by its specific political targets, the narrative arc successfully carries the hearer toward an 'Easter' alternative. It is a well-constructed 'event' that seeks to move the congregation from anxiety to joy."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'cheap comfort' by dwelling in the 'midnight' and the 'severe flogging.' There is no 'happy ending' that ignores the reality of the prison; rather, the joy is found *within* the prison. The preacher avoids sentimental language about Jesus, opting instead for 'buoyant' and 'countercultural' terms. It takes the 'pain of suffering' and the 'abusive magistrates' seriously, ensuring that the grace proclaimed is 'costly' rather than 'cheap' (Bonhoeffer/Cilliers).",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None identified; the sermon avoids the usual 'Jesus is the answer' clichés.",
      "The modernization of the slave girl avoids the 'spooky' supernatural kitsch often found in this text."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'severe flogging' and 'torture' as a reality for frightened people.",
      "The focus on the jailer's 'hospitality' as a concrete, un-sentimental response to grace."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of 'sober beauty' by continuing to ground grace in concrete social and physical realities."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened by contrasting it with the 'fated' and 'programmed' world of the fortune-teller. By defining the gospel as 'uncommon freedom,' the preacher creates a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) that is not controlled by the 'money men.' However, the space is slightly constricted by the heavy emphasis on the 'social crisis'—at times, the 'human actor' (the pimp, the judge) seems more prominent than the 'Divine Actor' (Immink). The 'midnight' earthquake is the primary moment where the 'unavailable' grace of God breaks through the 'settled society.'",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'Orange Alert' of the world and the 'joy' of the church is well-sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "The earthquake is left as a 'quaking, a shaking' without over-explanation, respecting the mystery of God's intervention.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails as an 'alternative way to live,' though it is closely tied to the ethical imperative of hospitality.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'vertical' dimension of the earthquake and the 'Divine Actor' to have even more weight to prevent the sermon from becoming purely 'horizontal' social ethics."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'Prophetic Reframing.' It excels in Domain B (Structure) by creating a compelling narrative arc that bridges the biblical world and the contemporary social landscape. The language is precise, rhythmic, and intentionally provocative, successfully avoiding the pitfalls of religious kitsch. The preacher uses the 'aesthetic turn' not to beautify the message, but to make the 'strangeness' of the gospel visible and audible in a culture of fear. While it leans heavily toward social critique, it maintains a 'Space for Grace' by presenting the church's life as a 'buoyant' and 'free' alternative to the programmed world of greed. It is a 'sober' aesthetic that finds beauty in the 'midnight' singing and the 'washing of wounds.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'Reframing' of biblical characters into contemporary social archetypes.",
      "Strong rhetorical rhythm and 'oral' quality, especially in the conclusion.",
      "Complete avoidance of religious kitsch and cheap sentimentality."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase sensory imagery to 'show' the drama more vividly.",
      "Ensure the 'Divine Actor' is not overshadowed by the social analysis.",
      "Open the 'closed' social categories to allow for broader hearer appropriation."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Reframing / Socio-Dramatic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Preacher as Witness' of Thomas Long.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who are socially conscious, weary of traditional religious jargon, and looking for a 'counter-cultural' expression of faith.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'poetic-imagistic' language to complement the 'prophetic' tone.",
      "Integrate the liturgical 'Psalm' more deeply into the sermon's structure.",
      "Focus on a moment of 'pure grace' that is less tied to social action to deepen the 'vertical' dimension."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a high-quality aesthetic event that successfully 'reframes' the gospel as a radical alternative to a fearful society. It avoids the 'kitsch' of easy answers and instead invites the hearer into the 'strange' and 'buoyant' life of the Jesus people. While its specific social targets may date the piece, its structural integrity and rhetorical precision make it a compelling model of contemporary prophetic preaching. It opens a significant 'Space for Grace' by showing that even at 'midnight,' in the heart of the prison, a new way of being human is possible."
