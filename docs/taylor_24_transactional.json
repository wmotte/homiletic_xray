    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful rhetorical piece that moves from Nurturing Parent empathy to Critical Parent judgment. While it addresses vital social issues (racism), it does so by inducing a 'Scared Child' state in the listener through vivid, monstrous imagery. The psychological impact is one of exposure and shame rather than empowered Adult reflection.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of narrative and imagery to engage the Child ego.",
      "Courageous Adult-level naming of systemic racism and social hypocrisy."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The shift from the 'unfinished painting' to 'loathsome monsters' is a jarring psychological escalation.",
      "Heavy reliance on shaming language ('hideous', 'crawling', 'sick') to motivate change."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to maintain the Adult-to-Adult transaction when discussing social issues. Instead of using 'monster' imagery to provoke fear, provide data and invite the listener to evaluate their own 'masks' through objective self-reflection."
