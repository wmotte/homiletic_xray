    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically supportive but leans heavily on the Nurturing Parent ego state. It utilizes the 'Ain't It Awful' game to build a sense of shared tragedy before introducing the 'Rescuer' (Jesus/The Gospel). While it avoids the toxicity of the Critical Parent, it risks creating a dependency on emotional highs and sentimental imagery rather than fostering an Adult-level faith that can process grief realistically.",
    "strengths": [
      "High empathy and validation of human suffering.",
      "Avoidance of shaming or coercive 'NIGYSOB' dynamics.",
      "Strong use of Free Child imagery to inspire hope."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on pathos (Victim role) to set up the message.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult engagement regarding how to live 'here-and-now'.",
      "Tendency toward 'Ain't It Awful' regarding the state of society."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Incorporate more Adult ego state by asking the congregation to reflect on how the resurrection changes their current ethical choices, rather than just their emotional state. Reduce the 'con' of hyper-descriptive tragedy to allow the hope to stand on its own merit."
