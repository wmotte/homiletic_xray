  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The sermon is not an exposition of a Bible passage but a funeral eulogy. The Scripture (Ecclesiastes 12:5) is used as a decorative quote to illustrate the deceased's state of mind rather than being the source or foundation of the message. It fails Dekker’s requirement that the sermon must be the 'recreating of that Bible into a new, current, proclamatory word.'",
      "quotes": [
        "In Mexico last winter he quoted to me in great weariness from Ecclesiastes: 'The grasshopper shall be a burden... because man goeth to his long home' (Ecclesiastes 12:5)."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must start with the text itself, not the biography of the deceased. The sermon should explore what Ecclesiastes 12 specifically says about the frailty of man that no other text says, rather than using it as a transition to a sentimental description of heaven."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 1,
      "findings": "There is zero exegesis. No attention is paid to the Hebrew context of Ecclesiastes, the poetic structure of the 'aging' imagery, or the theological intent of the author. The text is treated as a personal anecdote.",
      "quotes": [
        "In Mexico last winter he quoted to me..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher needs to apply the tools of the humanities—specifically linguistic and historical analysis—to explain the 'long home' in its original context before attempting to apply it."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The application is entirely biographical and sentimental. While it is 'concrete' in its mention of specific cities (Philadelphia, Washington) and people (Cille, Lorenza), it is not an application of the Word of God to the zeitgeist or the spiritual life of the congregation. It is a speech about a 'biblical character' (the deceased as a type of character) which Dekker explicitly forbids.",
      "quotes": [
        "Philadelphia, he loved you with a schoolboy's ardor and served your civic welfare as a priest at an altar."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move away from the 'Master-Friend' as the subject and move toward the 'Master' (God). The application should address the congregation's mortality and God's calling in the present time."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 1,
      "findings": "Since there is no exposition, there can be no interwoveness. The text and the 'application' (the eulogy) are completely detached. The hearer is not drawn into the text, but into a nostalgic memory of a man.",
      "quotes": [
        "I must not linger upon this. How often I called on the telephone..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must weave the biblical imagery of the 'grasshopper' and the 'burden' into the narrative of human life and death, making the text the lens through which the life is viewed, not vice-versa."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Gratitude is present in the form of appreciation for the deceased's life. Misery is touched upon through the 'weariness' of the deceased, but it is not 'misery before God' (sin/mortality as judgment). Redemption is assumed as a pleasant afterlife, but lacks the theological weight of Christ's intervention.",
      "quotes": [
        "Somewhere where weariness does not come, where winter's chill never troubles and prejudice never poisons..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The 'misery' of death must be taken more seriously as a theological reality, not just physical exhaustion. The 'gratitude' should be directed toward God's grace, not just the deceased's 'intrepid courage'."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The sermon operates on the assumption of universal safety. There is no sense of the 'narrow way' or the possibility of being lost. The 'long home' is presented as an inevitable 'welcome table' regardless of the 'two ways'.",
      "quotes": [
        "I know where Shep is... we'll sit at a welcome table and talk and talk and talk."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must take the hearer 'completely seriously' by pointing to the ultimate possibilities of life design and the necessity of answering God's calling before the 'grasshopper becomes a burden'."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned at the beginning as a reason for coming, but He is not the 'telos' of the sermon. The deceased (Shepard) is the telos. The 'salvation outside himself' is replaced by the 'inheritance' earned by being a 'Master-Friend'.",
      "quotes": [
        "because I am a Christian, I come to witness his passing into the fullness of his inheritance"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Christ must be the goal that detaches man from himself. The sermon should focus on how Christ, as God, overcomes the 'long home' of Ecclesiastes, rather than focusing on the deceased's civic virtues."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "At approximately 8-9 minutes, the sermon is far too short to achieve the 'breadth' required for 'depth'. It remains at the level of an occasional speech.",
      "improvement_point": "The sermon needs to be expanded by at least 12 minutes of substantive biblical exposition and dogmatic reflection to meet the 20-minute threshold."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "According to Dekker’s criteria, this text is not a sermon but a biographical speech. It lacks a central Bible passage, contains no exegesis, and substitutes the 'one Lord' (Christ) with the 'Master-Friend' (the deceased). The seriousness of the 'two ways' is entirely absent, replaced by a sentimentalized view of the afterlife.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete language: The use of specific names and locations makes the speech grounded in reality.",
      "Psychological awareness: The preacher addresses the grief of the family members directly, which aligns with Dekker's view on the importance of the human subject."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of Scriptural foundation: The Bible is an ornament, not the source.",
      "Absence of Theology: Dogma and Christology are 'sleeping' not just during the sermon, but are entirely absent.",
      "Insufficient length: The duration precludes any possibility of theological depth."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a failing performance in the context of homiletics. It is a 'bicycle mechanic who does not properly mount the wheel.' It fails the formal definition of a sermon as 'exposition and application of a specific Bible passage' and functions instead as a secular tribute with religious coloring."
