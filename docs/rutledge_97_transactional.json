    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust, operating almost entirely from the Adult ego state. It avoids the common 'guilt-trip' or 'false-comfort' traps of religious discourse. By acknowledging the 'dark aspect' of the narrative (Herod's violence), it respects the listener's capacity to handle reality, thereby promoting psychological maturity and autonomy. It refuses to play the 'Rescuer' by offering a sanitized version of the gospel.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "Deconstruction of sentimental 'Child' fantasies.",

      "Could incorporate more 'Free Child' spontaneity to balance the heavy intellectualism.",
      "Slight risk of 'Parental' intellectual elitism."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to invite the congregation into the 'Here-and-Now' of the text's difficulty. Ensure that the critique of 'sentimentalism' doesn't become a 'Critical Parent' shaming of those who find comfort in tradition."
