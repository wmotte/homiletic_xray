    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, providing a historical and theological framework that respects the listener's autonomy. By validating both the need for 'free grace' (Free Child/Adult) and 'moral passion' (Nurturing/Structured Parent), the preacher avoids the trap of becoming a Persecutor. The use of the 'teenager' metaphor is the only moment of potential regression, but it is used to explain a psychological reality rather than to infantilize the audience.",

      "High transparency regarding the conflict between Law and Grace.",

      "Could further engage the 'Free Child' by expanding on the 'lyric of grace' to balance the heavy 'Torah piety' sections."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' position to analyze theological tensions. Ensure that when using 'Parental' metaphors (like the teenager driving), you continue to frame them as external examples rather than direct instructions to the congregation."
