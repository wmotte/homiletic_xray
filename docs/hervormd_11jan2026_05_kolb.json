    "sermon_start_end": "Gemeente, hoe vaak worden we in preken niet uitgenodigd om tot Jezus te komen? Vaak ook heel uitgesproken. En daarbij wordt ook nog wel eens regelmatig de uitspraak van Jezus aangehaald: \"Kom allen tot Mij, die vermoeid en belast zijn, en Ik zal u rust geven.\" [...] Maar juist daarom is het zo belangrijk om dicht bij Jezus te zijn, om Jezus op te zoeken, om vertrouwd met Hem te zijn. Dan zal Hij jezelf vullen, en dan zul je zelf ook steeds meer vrijmoedigheid krijgen om over Hem te spreken. Want Jezus nodigt ons uit. Amen.",
    "notes": "The sermon follows a traditional Reformed-pietistic structure with a strong focus on the internal decision-making process of the believer."

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon attempts to connect with the hearer's life world but often remains at a generic level. While it mentions specific modern issues like youth's fear of commitment or a news story about a leader's infidelity, it lacks a truly immersive narrative 'hook' that allows the hearer to feel the biblical story from within. The identification with the disciples is more cognitive than experiential.",

      "analysis": "Reflection is present through the exploration of 'why' people hesitate to follow Jesus. The preacher analyzes internal barriers such as 'orthodoxy' as a shield or the desire for freedom.

    "summary": "The sermon is a solid, teaching-oriented discourse that functions well within a traditional Reformed framework. It is particularly strong in 'Abstract Conceptualization', providing a clear and multifaceted explanation of Jesus as the 'Lamb of God'. It successfully identifies modern barriers to faith, such as commitment phobia and the misuse of orthodoxy, which aids 'Reflective Observation'. However, the sermon falls short in 'Concrete Experience'; it lacks a compelling narrative or sensory opening that draws the hearer into the biblical world. The 'Active Experimentation' phase is present and helpful, though it remains largely focused on individual spiritual habits and low-stakes social interaction. The balance is tilted toward the 'Assimilating' learning style, making it intellectually satisfying but potentially less engaging for those who learn through intuition or vivid storytelling.",

      "Accommodating: Hearers who need to 'feel' the story and act intuitively may find the sermon too analytical."

    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Start with a 'slice of life' narrative that embodies the tension of the text.",
      "Use more sensory language (sight, sound, smell) when describing biblical scenes.",
      "Spend more time in the 'Visionary' quadrant to build a sense of 'Why this matters' before 'How to do it'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a reliable example of the 'Teaching Sermon' (Leerrede). It provides the congregation with clear theological categories and practical handles for their faith life. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'safe' sermon that completes the cycle but lacks the 'Concrete Experience' intensity required for transformative learning in a postmodern context. The priority for improvement is the development of narrative and visionary skills to better engage the 'Accommodating' and 'Diverging' learners."
