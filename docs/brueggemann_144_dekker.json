    "sermon_start_end": "You know how congregational singing goes. You look at the bulletin, get the hymn number, and reiterate the words of the assigned hymn, all very routine. It is especially routine in the Episcopal Church whose hymnal has more unsingable songs than any other hymnal that I know. [...] The saints gathered around the throne sing praise to the lamb, dissolved in doxology; Paul and his kind sing because they have been given a new mission in life; Ordinary folks like us sing because our sadness has turned to dancing, our funeral clothes replaced by clothes of joy."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on one specific passage. It treats Psalm 30, Revelation 5, and Acts 9 as interchangeable illustrations of a general theme ('singing'). It does not identify what is unique to Psalm 30 that cannot be found elsewhere.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have three dimensions of such singing in our readings for today.",
        "In Christian tradition, quite ordinary people like us find the power of God surging through our lives to make all things new. As a result every one of us could sing Psalm 30."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one pericope. Abandon the 'thematic' approach. Ask: what does Psalm 30 say about God's 'drawing up' that Revelation 5 does not?"
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of linguistic study or historical-critical engagement with the Hebrew or Greek. The original context of the Psalmist or the specific situation of the Johannine community is replaced by modern sociological observations.",
      "quotes": [
        "The rhetoric sounds like Donald Trump: 'myriads of myriads'...",
        "But let me give you a sociology of hymn singing that is based in very clear scientific research."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explain the specific cultic or historical setting of Psalm 30. What did 'Sheol' mean to the original singer, rather than using it as a metaphor for 'market collapse'?"
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the 'zeitgeist' (affluence vs. vulnerability), which Dekker values. However, it borders on general psychological truths about 'energy' and 'joy' rather than specific spiritual direction.",
      "quotes": [
        "The more affluent and sophisticated we are, the more feebly we sing.",
        "Every one of us knows about being well off and then being suddenly dismayed... by health collapse or market collapse."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond 'feelings' of joy and energy toward concrete ethical or political consequences of this 'dangerous' singing in the local congregation."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured as a series of reflections where the text serves as a springboard for application. While not a 'block' structure, the text is often used to validate the preacher's sociological observations rather than the text 'expounding' the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "So I want to think with you about Easter singing.",
        "We can participate in the story of this Psalmist."

      "improvement_point": "Allow the text's own movement (e.g., the shift from verse 7 to 8 in Psalm 30) to dictate the movement of the hearer's experience."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon strongly reflects the movement from misery ('Friday hatred', 'dismay') to redemption ('Sunday love', 'drawn me up') and gratitude ('gratitude', 'doxology'). This is the sermon's strongest structural alignment with Dekker.",
      "quotes": [
        "His Friday death was an exhibit of hatred, injury, doubt, despair, darkness, and sadness.",
        "Such singing evokes thanks that grounds our life in gratitude."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by grounding it in sin/estrangement from God rather than just 'market collapse' or 'sadness'."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "While the sermon mentions 'defiance' and 'danger', the ultimate seriousness of being 'lost' (temporal or eternal) is softened into a psychological 'new way of life'. The 'empire' is the enemy, but the hearer's own lostness is less clear.",
      "quotes": [
        "Singing Easter is an act of defiance against every empire and every controlling regime.",
        "We can readily imagine Paul and his friends singing, 'Amazing Grace,' lost and then found."

      "improvement_point": "Address the possibility of remaining in 'routine' as a form of being lost—a failure to answer God's calling."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ (the Lamb) is clearly the telos. The sermon emphasizes that the transformation is a work of God/Christ, not human effort. The doctrine of the two natures is implicit in the 'vulnerable lamb' who is 'ruling'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The lamb is so vulnerable and helpless... this vulnerable lamb is worthy: 'To receive power and wealth...'",
        "It is Christ who is his life [implied by the Paul section]."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly link the 'healing' in Psalm 30 to the mediation of Christ to avoid a purely 'theistic' rather than 'Christian' sermon."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The estimated duration is approximately 14-15 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for true depth.",

      "improvement_point": "Expand the exposition of the specific Bible passage to reach the 20-minute threshold."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon functions more as a thematic address on 'the theology of singing' than an exposition of a specific Bible passage. It lacks the rigorous exegesis (Hebrew/Greek context) demanded by Dekker and spreads itself too thin across three different scriptures. However, it successfully captures the movement of misery, redemption, and gratitude, and maintains a clear Christological focus.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Trinitarian/Christological telos (the Lamb).",
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' (misery, redemption, gratitude) as a background framework.",
      "Concrete awareness of the zeitgeist regarding affluence and self-sufficiency."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specificity: fails to identify what is unique to Psalm 30.",
      "Insufficient length: falls short of the 20-minute requirement for depth.",
      "Absence of formal exegesis: relies on sociology rather than biblical philology and history."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an engaging religious speech, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict sense of Dekker's definition because it lacks the 'exposition of one specific Bible passage' and the required 'breadth' of duration."
