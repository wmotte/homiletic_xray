    "sermon_start_end": "In the Northern Hemisphere, this is the darkest time of the year. It’s when the days are short and the light fails quickly. That’s one of the reasons the church developed a festival called Epiphany. [...] That’s beautiful. Let’s pray."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Isaiah 60 as a springboard but quickly pivots to a general thematic meditation on 'Light'. It fails to identify what is unique to Isaiah 60 that cannot be found elsewhere. The text is treated as a 'vision of the end time' that is immediately harmonized with the New Testament, losing the specific prophetic voice of the pericope.",
      "quotes": [
        "The passage you just had read to you is an interesting passage to work off of.",
        "Tonight, I just want to share with you a meditation on this subject of Jesus as the divine Light come into a dark world."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the specific historical and theological tension of Zion's restoration in Isaiah 60 rather than treating it as a generic 'light' metaphor."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is superficial. While it mentions the return from Babylon, it dismisses the historical reality as 'too great for that' to move into a spiritualized interpretation. There is no evidence of engagement with the original languages or the specific theology of the Book of Consolation.",
      "quotes": [
        "You notice at first it looks like it’s talking about Israel coming back from exile in Babylon, but it’s too great for that."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Engage with the specific imagery of the 'wealth of nations' and the 'rebuilding of walls' within the post-exilic context of Israel before jumping to a universalized eschatology."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part of the sermon. It avoids vague moralism by challenging the hearer on concrete psychological and social markers (handling criticism, impulsivity, anxiety). It effectively uses the 'zeitgeist' of self-improvement and compares it to organic growth.",
      "quotes": [
        "Are you a happier person than you were two years ago?",
        "Would you say you take criticism better because you’re a humbler person than you were two years ago?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect these psychological insights more directly to the specific promises of Isaiah 60 rather than general 'growth in grace'."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a thematic structure (Life, Truth, Beauty) which allows for some mixing, but it still feels like a lecture where the text is a 'case study' for the preacher's points rather than the text itself 'expounding' the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "There are three aspects to sunlight, which I’m going to use all through the rest of the sermon."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Let the movement of the Isaiah text (from darkness to radiance) dictate the sermon's structure rather than an external three-point framework."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The categories of misery (blindness, smudges on the soul), redemption (Christ's work on the cross), and gratitude (the resulting attractive life) are clearly present in the background. The preacher successfully 'reclaims' psychology for the church as Dekker suggests.",
      "quotes": [
        "You see your flaws. You see your sins. You see things you never saw before...",
        "If you really could love him more than anything else, it would soften your heart."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'misery' is not just psychological 'flaws' but the radical 'lostness' Dekker emphasizes in Thesis 6."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on 'cosmic darkness' and 'hell', but it lacks the sharp edge of the 'two ways'. The choice is presented more as a path to 'attractiveness' and 'happiness' rather than a journey with the possibility of being lost in time or eternity.",
      "quotes": [
        "The ultimate darkness would be to be totally separated from God.",
        "He experienced the darkness we deserve so we could be light."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'nation or kingdom that will not serve you will perish' (v. 12) from the text to bring in the seriousness of the 'two ways'."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "The sermon is strongly Christocentric. Christ is the telos, and the preacher explicitly utilizes the doctrine of the two natures (God become kinsman) to explain redemption. Grace is presented as the only source of life.",
      "quotes": [
        "I am the glory of God become human. I am God become your kinsman...",
        "The Light of the World was plunged into darkness."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid making Christ a 'solution' to a psychological problem; keep Him as the Lord of the text."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At approximately 28 minutes, the sermon meets Dekker's requirement for breadth to achieve depth. It allows time for illustrations and psychological probing.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "None; the length is adequate for the subject matter."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily in its formal handling of the specific Bible passage. It treats Isaiah 60 as a thematic resource for a meditation on 'light' rather than an authoritative, unique Word that must be expounded in its original context. It moves too quickly to New Testament harmonization. However, it excels in concrete application and psychological depth, successfully avoiding 'general truths' by challenging the hearer's specific life design and inner state.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application that avoids vague moralism.",
      "Strong Christocentric focus with a clear emphasis on grace as the source of transformation.",
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' (misery, redemption, gratitude) as a background framework."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Weak exegesis that dismisses the historical context of the pericope.",
      "Lack of specificity: the sermon could have been preached on almost any 'light' text in the Bible.",
      "Insufficient emphasis on the 'two ways' and the radical possibility of being lost."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a strong religious speech with high therapeutic value, but it only partially qualifies as a 'sermon' by Dekker's strict definition because it lacks rigorous exposition of the *specific* Bible passage and its unique, non-interchangeable message."
