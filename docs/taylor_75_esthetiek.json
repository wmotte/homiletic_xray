    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon opens with a powerful, gothic metaphor: the 'haunted house'. This provides a strong sensory and emotional anchor. The preacher successfully translates the abstract concept of memory and temptation into 'ghosts' and 'phantom figures'. There is a cinematic quality to the description of the fire and the 'hellhounds baying on your trail'. However, the imagery becomes more conventional and less 'living' as the sermon progresses, shifting into lists of abstract vices (envy, greed, lust) that lack the sensory detail of the opening. The 'ram in the thicket' and 'Red Sea' are classic biblical images, but they are used as illustrations rather than fresh metaphors. According to Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell', the first third of the sermon is excellent, while the middle section relies more on 'telling' through lists.",
      "quotes": [
        "What ghosts of memory flit eerily? and what phantom figures out of the past move often unbidden and unbeckoned through our remembrances, flashing before us like pictures on a television screen?",
        "Repeat it when the hellhounds are baying on your trail, all earthly help has failed, and friends have walked away.",
        "God gave Abraham a ram in the thicket only when his hand was upraised to slay his little child, Isaac."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The 'haunted house' metaphor is a highly effective 'reframing' of the human psyche.",
        "Use of cinematic verbs like 'flit', 'flash', and 'thunder' creates movement.",
        "Strong sensory connection to the congregation's history (the fire)."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The list of temptations (lust, greed, etc.) could be more concrete; instead of naming the sin, describe its 'stench' or 'weight'.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is generally clear and avoids overly dense academic jargon, adhering to McEntyre’s 'stewardship of language'. However, it falls into 'Canaanite' patterns in the latter half, using repetitive religious phrases ('Kingdom', 'household of faith', 'spotlessness of my own righteousness'). The preacher uses strong, almost aggressive language when addressing gossip ('slander merchants', 'partners of hell'), which provides precision in moral judgment but lacks nuance in pastoral psychology. The distinction between 'temptations upward' and scriptural temptation is a helpful bit of precision that clarifies the text's specific intent. The sentence structure is balanced, though occasionally leans toward the melodramatic.",
      "quotes": [
        "I name you now, you talebearers, you gossipmongers, you slander merchants — partners of hell, enemies of God.",
        "The Scriptures, however, use the word temptation in a different way. Scripturally, temptation usually is that which tests our faithfulness to God.",
        "You muddy my child, and I will clean him until he stands in the spotlessness of my own righteousness."

        "Refine the transition between the 'haunted house' and the 'talebearers' section for better thematic coherence."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Moderate use of traditional religious jargon; mostly explained or used for rhetorical effect rather than obscuring meaning."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong suit of the sermon. The preacher uses classical rhetorical figures such as anaphora ('God puts... God puts...') and parallelism ('You strike, and I will protect. You hurt, and I will heal.') to create a rhythmic, almost liturgical cadence. The variation in sentence length—moving from long, descriptive sentences in the 'haunted house' section to short, punchy declarations like 'God is faithful!'—creates a dynamic 'flow' essential for oral delivery. The use of alliteration ('met and matched, confronted and conquered') enhances memorability. It is clearly written for the ear, not the eye, avoiding the 'paper language' Grözinger warns against.",
      "quotes": [
        "God puts daybreak in the midnight. God puts peace in the confusion. God puts healing in the hurt.",
        "You block the path; I will open a highway. You close the door, and I will open it.",

        "The list of temptations ('the temptation of... the temptation of...') becomes slightly monotonous; varying the structure here would sustain energy.",
        "The transition to the final list of verbs ('praise him, thank him, love him...') feels a bit like a standard 'closing' formula.",
        "Ensure the 'God is faithful' repetitions don't become predictable by varying the volume or pace implied in the text."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Decidedly oral language; the text is designed for performance and rhythmic impact."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon demonstrates a high degree of micro-aesthetic awareness, particularly in its musicality and initial imagery. The 'haunted house' metaphor serves as a brilliant aesthetic entry point, reframing the internal life of the believer. While the language occasionally slips into traditional religious tropes and repetitive lists, the rhythmic structure and use of rhetorical figures like anaphora and parallelism ensure the sermon remains engaging and memorable. It successfully balances 'showing' and 'telling' in its best moments, though it leans on conventional religious vocabulary toward the end."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear movement from the 'trouble' (the haunted house of life/temptation) to the 'grace' (God’s faithfulness). There is an 'upsetting of equilibrium' at the start with the image of the haunted house. However, the structure is somewhat episodic. The section on gossip feels like a detour—a 'sermon within a sermon'—that disrupts the broader arc of the 'way to escape'. The turning point is the declaration 'God is faithful', but the progression toward the end feels more like an accumulation of promises than a single narrative journey. It lacks the 'Lowry Loop's' tight focus, functioning more as a thematic exploration with high emotional peaks.",
      "quotes": [
        "A haunted house? Yes, our lives are haunted houses.",
        "I name you now, you talebearers, you gossipmongers... partners of hell.",

      "plot_diagnosis": "A hybrid of a thematic exploration and a narrative journey; occasionally static due to lists of vices."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher does an excellent job of 'reframing' (Cilliers) the biblical text through the lens of the congregation's experience (the fire, the aging process). The connection between the 'common' nature of temptation and the shared history of the church is organic. The sermon respects the 'strangeness' of the text by not simplifying temptation into mere 'bad habits', but seeing it as a cosmic struggle. The synthesis of the Corinthian context and the 'haunted house' of modern memory is creative. However, the application to 'gossipmongers' feels less like 'reframing' and more like a direct, perhaps localized, polemic.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have thought lately of the night and day following our great fire over twenty-five years ago...",
        "They are old characters, and God and his people know them. Their number has been taken...",
        "God hides the way out inside the temptation. God puts daybreak in the midnight."
      ],

        "Effective use of local history to ground the biblical promise.",
        "The 'reframing' of temptation as a 'haunting' is psychologically insightful.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'television screen' analogy is a bit dated; finding a more contemporary 'frame' for memory could strengthen the context.",
        "Connect the 'way to escape' more specifically to contemporary challenges beyond gossip.",
        "Ensure the 'reframing' doesn't just confirm the hearer's identity as a 'victim' of temptation but also as an agent of grace."

      "reframing_present": "Yes, the sermon offers a new frame (the haunted house) to view the old problem of temptation."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "In terms of Ciska Stark’s 'open work of art', this sermon leans toward being 'closed'. The preacher provides definitive answers and strong moral categories ('partners of hell'). While there is room for the 'ambivalence of existence' in the haunted house metaphor, the latter half of the sermon is highly prescriptive and declarative. The ending is a list of certainties rather than an invitation to wonder or an open-ended question. The hearer is guided through a very specific emotional and theological path with little room for 'resistance' or alternative interpretation. It is a sermon of 'witness' (Long) but also of 'instruction'.",
      "quotes": [
        "I name you now... partners of hell, enemies of God — these are your titles.",
        "God knows, actually knows, how much we can bear.",
        "So in it all, God makes us able to praise him..."

      "strengths": [
        "Provides strong, clear comfort to those feeling overwhelmed.",
        "The preacher takes a clear stand, which can be aesthetically 'honest'.",
        "The liturgical ending provides a clear 'exit' for the congregation."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Leave more room for the 'not yet'—the moments when the 'way to escape' isn't immediately visible.",
        "Use more questions to invite the hearer into the interpretation of their own 'haunted house'.",
        "Avoid the definitive 'naming' of people as 'enemies of God', which closes off the possibility of their own struggle with temptation."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Predominantly monovalent and closed; the preacher acts as the authoritative interpreter of both the text and the hearer's life."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is characterized by a strong, evocative opening that sets a high bar for the rest of the sermon. The narrative arc moves effectively from the 'haunted' reality of human life to the 'faithfulness' of God. However, the structure is occasionally hampered by episodic detours and a tendency toward 'closing' the text with definitive moral judgments. The integration of text and context is a highlight, particularly through the use of congregational memory, though the sermon ultimately functions as a closed system of truth rather than an open work of art."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon narrowly avoids religious kitsch through its initial acknowledgment of the 'haunted' and 'eerily' flitting ghosts of the past. It takes the 'region of death' seriously. However, it flirts with kitsch in the final section where the 'way out' is described in very tidy, rhythmic binaries ('You strike, and I will protect'). This risks offering a 'happy ending' that is too neatly resolved. The 'hellhounds' and 'dark clouds' are somewhat clichéd tropes. Authentic depth is found in the connection to the church's fire and the aging process, but the resolution feels slightly 'pre-chewed' in its rhetorical perfection.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The list of 'You strike, I protect' binaries, which simplifies the complexity of suffering into a neat rhetorical pattern.",
      "The use of 'dark clouds gather and strong winds blow' as a generic placeholder for actual human pain."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'haunted house' and the 'phantom figures' of memory.",
      "The honest admission of 'spiritual weariness' and 'misunderstanding' as real guests in the house."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To increase depth, allow the 'midnight' to remain dark for a moment longer before introducing the 'daybreak'. Avoid the 'neatness' of the final antitheses."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened by the central affirmation that 'God is faithful' and that the 'way out' is hidden *inside* the temptation. This suggests a God who is present in the struggle, not just at the end of it. However, space is partially closed by the heavy moralization in the section on gossip, where the preacher 'names' and categorizes hearers as 'allies of hell'. This creates a space of judgment rather than a 'space for grace'. The mystery of God is respected in the 'haunted house' metaphor but explained away in the final rhythmic declarations.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained well in the first half but resolved perhaps too quickly and rhetorically in the second.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'haunted' nature of life respects mystery; the 'way out' section tends to explain it away.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the overall theme, but moralization takes over in the middle section on talebearing.",
    "recommendation": "Soften the moralizing categories to allow the 'faithful God' to be the primary actor even for the 'gossipmonger'."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust example of traditional rhetorical preaching. Its greatest strength lies in its 'micro-aesthetics'—the rhythm, cadence, and initial imagery. The metaphor of the 'haunted house' is a brilliant homiletical move that reframes the human condition in a way that is both biblically grounded and psychologically resonant. The preacher demonstrates a high level of 'stewardship of language' in terms of clarity and oral impact. However, the sermon suffers from a 'macro-aesthetic' unevenness. The middle section’s shift into a sharp polemic against gossip, while perhaps pastorally necessary, feels like a dramaturgical rupture. Furthermore, the sermon’s tendency to resolve the 'haunting' of life through neat rhetorical antitheses risks sliding into religious kitsch, where the 'happy ending' is guaranteed by the preacher’s rhythmic certainty rather than the hearer’s lived encounter with grace. It is a 'closed' work that offers strong comfort but leaves little room for the hearer’s own interpretive journey.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "The 'haunted house' metaphor as a creative reframing of memory and temptation.",
      "Excellent rhetorical rhythm and use of anaphora ('God is faithful', 'God puts...').",
      "Strong integration of congregational history (the fire) with the biblical text."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduce the reliance on clichéd religious tropes in the second half.",
      "Soften the moralistic 'naming' of enemies to maintain a consistent space for grace.",
      "Allow for more 'openness' by using questions instead of only declarations."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Poetic-Rhetorical with a Gothic-Reformed undertone.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Wilson’s 'Four Pages' structure (Trouble/Grace) and Cilliers' 'Reframing', though it lacks Stark’s 'Openness'.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who value traditional authority, clear moral boundaries, and high rhetorical energy will be most appealed to.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer in the 'between' space.",
      "Use more 'showing' in the application section to match the quality of the introduction.",
      "Vary the rhythmic patterns to avoid the 'monotony of the list'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This is a 'good' sermon (6.5) that approaches 'strong' (7-8) in its best moments. It succeeds as a performance of faithfulness and a witness to God’s presence. Its aesthetic value is primarily in its ability to 'paint' a picture of the inner life, though it ultimately prioritizes rhetorical closure over the 'open' mystery of grace. It is a model of how to use rhythm to sustain a congregation’s attention, but also a warning of how rhythm can sometimes smooth over the jagged edges of human suffering."
