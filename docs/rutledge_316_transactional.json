    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "While theologically traditional, the sermon is psychologically taxing. It relies heavily on 'You're Not OK' messaging to create a dependency on the 'Rescuer' (Christ/Preacher). It systematically dismantles the listener's Adult ego by asserting that their thoughts and actions are inevitably sinful, thereby enforcing a permanent Adapted Child state. The 'comfort' offered is a form of relief from the very shame the sermon itself generates.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as Adult partners in a shared reality rather than 'slaves.' Instead of predicting their failure ('You will have already failed'), invite them to explore how their Adult ego can respond to the grace described."
