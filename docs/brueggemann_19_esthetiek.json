    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in sensory 'painting.' It avoids abstract discussion of 'poverty' in favor of 'the stench of licked sores' and 'the droppings from the table.' Brueggemann utilizes the 'cinematic' quality advocated by Paul Scott Wilson, particularly in the juxtaposition of fine linen and open sores. The imagery of the 'ditch' or 'chasm' is not merely a theological concept but a physical barrier that structures the entire narrative. The metaphor of the 'water boy' for Lazarus in the afterlife effectively exposes the rich man's persistent hubris. The language forces the hearer to 'see' the scene before judging it, adhering to the 'show, don't tell' principle until the final application.",
      "quotes": [
        "The rich man is dressed in fine linen and eats something like a banquet at every meal.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise and avoids 'Canaanite' jargon. Brueggemann practices 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre) by redefining terms like 'family values' and 'self-actualization' within the biblical critique. He uses sharp, almost clinical adjectives ('cynical inequities', 'dreadful equity', 'apodictic clues'). There is a deliberate economy of words in the descriptions of death, which mirrors the suddenness of the event in the text. However, the tone occasionally leans toward the academic ('concrete operational people', 'ultimate calculus'), which might distance a less-educated hearer, though it serves to deconstruct 'sophisticated' defenses.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is a moment of dreadful equity, alike for an instant.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a distinct cadence, utilizing parallelism and repetition ('No name, and no comfort, no future, no water'). The rhythm mimics the 'upsetting of equilibrium' (Lowry). There is a staccato-like quality to the sentences describing the death of the two men, creating a sense of inevitability. The use of the 'Rock-a my Soul' refrain provides a lyrical counterpoint to the 'harsh, revolutionary requirements' of Moses. The sermon is clearly written for the ear, with a natural flow that builds toward the 'haunting' conclusion. The repetition of 'haunted' at the end creates a liturgical resonance.",
      "quotes": [

    "average_score_language": 7.67,

It avoids the 'kitsch' of sentimental religious talk by using 'dreadful' and 'harsh' descriptors. The musicality is high, particularly in the use of repetition to create an atmosphere of 'haunting.' It successfully 'shows' the biblical world before 'reframing' the contemporary one, practicing a high level of stewardship over words to pierce through the 'sophistication' of the hearer."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with the 'predictable' earthly scene, moves to the 'upsetting' of death, and then enters the 'unseen' reality which serves as the complication. The turning point is the realization that the 'ditch' is already fixed in life. The movement from Abraham to Moses creates a dramatic tension between grace and law. However, the 'three-part' structure (I, II, III) is somewhat traditional, and the energy dips slightly during the exegetical explanation of Genesis and Exodus before recovering in the final 'haunting' application.",
      "quotes": [
        "The first scene is about their life together on earth. It is a short scene, because the action is predictable...",
        "Only now does the story become interesting, because now the story takes us into the part of their life which we have not yet seen.",
        "The last scene we have in this little story is of Lazarus held close... the rich man... endlessly trapped."

        "The transition into the 'Old Testament options' (Genesis vs Exodus) feels a bit like a lecture, slowing the narrative momentum.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. Brueggemann performs a masterclass in 'reframing' (Cilliers). He connects the 'linen' of the rich man to 'health insurance' and 'surplus' without being moralistic. He respects the 'strangeness' of the text (Hades, Abraham's bosom) while making it feel urgently contemporary. The synthesis is organic: the 'ditch' of the parable becomes the 'indifference' of modern economic life. It doesn't just apply the text; it uses the text to provide a new 'optic' through which to view the 'haves and have-nots' in the pews.",
      "quotes": [
        "He is covered with sores; probably he has no health insurance.",
        "What the story does is to reframe our economic life... into a context of long-term division.",
        "Our common talk of religion and politics and economics is mostly about safe things, but here it comes down to food and hunger."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant use of 'reframing' to move from 'safe' religion to 'eternal significance' of economics.",
        "The connection between the rich man's lack of a name and his 'social role' is a profound contextual insight.",
        "Honors the 'toughness' of the biblical text without smoothing it over."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The mention of 'liberal or conservative' and 'welfare' is a bit dated in its phrasing.",
        "Could explore the 'dogs' metaphor in a contemporary context to deepen the 'context' side.",
        "The 'sophisticated people like us' trope is effective but could be more specific to the particular congregation."

      "reframing_present": "The sermon offers a radical new frame, turning a 'scare story' into a 'haunting' of the present economic conscience."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "In line with Stark's 'Open Work of Art,' the sermon refuses to give a 'to-do list.' It explicitly states, 'The story does not ask anyone to do anything.' This creates an aesthetic space where the hearer must sit with the 'haunting.' However, the theological framework (Abraham vs. Moses) is quite tightly constructed, which might feel 'closed' to some. The ending is theologically 'open'—it leaves the hearer in the 'tension'—but rhetorically 'heavy.' It respects the hearer as a mature partner by not 'scolding,' but the 'haunting' is a very specific, directed experience.",
      "quotes": [
        "The story does not ask anyone to do anything.",
        "There is nothing to do with a story but to be haunted by it.",
        "Who among us could entertain the notion that the important stuff in our life begins only afterward?"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Refusal to provide a moralistic 'happy ending' or a simple 'three steps to charity'.",
        "The ending with a 'haunting' leaves the interpretation and action to the hearer.",
        "Acknowledges the 'terrible tension' without resolving it."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'no questions asked' description of Abraham's bosom might be too 'closed' a definition of grace for some.",
        "The dismissal of 'self-actualization' and 'values' might close doors for certain hearers before the message lands.",
        "Could leave more room for the 'mystery' of the rich man's brothers' potential response."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "An 'open work' that uses 'haunting' as the primary mode of engagement, avoiding the 'sealed shut' nature of moralism."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is built on the concept of 'reframing' reality. It moves from the predictable earthly life to the shocking reversals of the afterlife, and finally to the 'haunting' of the present. By refusing to offer a moralistic checklist, it maintains the 'openness' of the parable while using the 'ditch' as a powerful structural metaphor. The integration of text and context is seamless, making the ancient parable feel like a contemporary economic critique."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a powerful antidote to religious kitsch. It explicitly rejects 'cheap comfort' and 'happy endings.' Brueggemann avoids the 'sentiment' of a loving God who ignores justice, replacing it with the 'authentic emotion' of a God who 'rearranges life in drastic ways.' There is no 'pre-chewed' emotion here; the 'haunting' is an invitation to genuine existential unease. The description of the rich man as 'forgotten, unnamed, and abandoned' is a stark, anti-kitsch reality check that refuses to 'beautify' the judgment.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential kitsch of 'Rock-a my Soul' is immediately subverted by the 'harsh, revolutionary requirements' of Moses.",
      "The 'family values' cliché is used ironically to expose the rich man's narrow concern."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The 'dreadful equity' of death described in a single phrase.",
      "The realization that the rich man is unnamed while the poor man is known by name."

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is created through the 'Bosom of Abraham' imagery, described as a place of 'comfort and warmth and caring' for the 'dirty' and 'sore-covered.' However, the sermon primarily functions as a 'Space for Judgment' that clears the ground for grace. By 'haunting' the hearer, it opens a space where the 'unavailable' (God's ultimate calculus) is acknowledged. It avoids 'moralization' by stating there is 'nothing to do,' yet the weight of the 'ditch' creates a very narrow space for the 'surplus side' hearer. The 'mystery' of God is respected as the one who 'rearranges life.'",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'tender father' and 'tough Moses' is the central axis of the sermon and is never fully resolved.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, especially in the 'unseen' part of the story which remains 'risky' and 'hidden'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace is presented as the 'wondrous truth of Abraham,' but the sermon's rhetorical weight falls on the 'warning' of Moses, leaning toward a 'prophetic imperative' rather than 'pure gift'.",
    "recommendation": "To open more space for grace, the 'welcoming embrace' of Abraham could be extended as a present possibility for the 'brothers' (the hearers), not just a future reward for Lazarus."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the 'New Homiletic' and 'Reframing.' It avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by embracing the 'terrible tension' of the biblical text. The language is sensory and rhythmic, creating a 'cinematic' experience of the parable that moves beyond abstract theology. Its greatest aesthetic achievement is the 'haunting' conclusion, which respects the 'openness' of the work of art by refusing to provide a moralistic exit strategy. While the structure is somewhat traditional and the tone occasionally academic, the 'stewardship of language' and the 'reframing' of economic indifference into eternal significance make it a powerful performance of the Word. It successfully creates a 'Space for Grace' by first clearing the 'kitsch' of comfortable, 'safe' religion.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of economic life through the lens of the 'ditch'.",

    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'legato' rhythm in the middle sections to match the 'warmth' of Abraham.",
      "Use more 'found' metaphors from the local context to ground the 'reframing' even further.",
      "Try an ending that is a 'question' rather than a 'statement of haunting' to increase polyvalence."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically high-quality 'event' that honors the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed tradition while utilizing modern rhetorical insights. It avoids the 'closed' nature of moralism and the 'kitsch' of easy comfort, leaving the hearer in a productive, 'haunted' space. It is a strong example of how form (the ditch/the haunting) can become content."
