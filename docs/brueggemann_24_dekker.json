[...] They shall not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain, says the LORD. (v. 25) That will be some newness! Some Christmas! Some gospel!"

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Isaiah 65 as a thematic backdrop, but it functions more as a 'biblical idea' of shalom than a rigorous engagement with the specific text. It misses the unique particularity of this passage (e.g., the specific imagery of the wolf and the lamb) until the very end, treating it as a general vision of 'newness'.",
      "quotes": [
        "This poet does the proper work of poetry, inviting us to cut free beyond ourselves and entertain the notion that other purposes for goodness..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify what Isaiah 65:17-25 says that is found NOWHERE else in the Bible. Move beyond the general concept of 'newness' to the specific prophetic imagery of the text."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of Greek or Hebrew study, nor any mention of the historical context of post-exilic Israel. The 'first readers' are entirely absent. The sermon treats the text as a timeless 'poem' rather than a word spoken into a specific historical crisis.",
      "quotes": [
        "So I invite you to entertain for a moment this poem, and let it seep into your bones..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the historical-critical context of the Third Isaiah. What did 'building houses' mean to a people returning from exile? Use original language insights to sharpen the exposition."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part, touching on 'eminent domain', 'taxed out of homes', and 'rapacious seizure'. However, it often veers back into generalities like 'greedy' and 'fearful' without specific local examples.",
      "quotes": [
        "No more people being taxed out of their homes, no more losing their vulnerable homes to the right of eminent domain..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the application even more concrete. Instead of 'sickness of our society', name a specific local or cultural manifestation of that sickness that the congregation recognizes."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a block structure: Vision (I), Reaction (II), Gospel/John (III), then Application. Exposition and application are largely separated into distinct movements rather than being mixed throughout.",
      "quotes": [
        "I told you it was outrageous. [...] Into this world of lyrical poetry, says our Gospel, pushes the unkempt, unwelcome figure of John the Baptizer."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Interweave the contemporary struggle with the text's specific promises from the beginning. Do not let the hearer stand 'beside' the text for 10 minutes before applying it."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is present as 'fatigue' and 'cynicism'. Redemption is framed as 'newness'. However, the sermon leans heavily on human effort ('our work of redeciding our life'), which risks obscuring the 'redemption through Christ' as an act of God alone.",
      "quotes": [
        "But God will not do our work of redeciding our life. There is for us, only us, the staggering possibility of choosing real life..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure that 'misery' is framed as misery before God, not just psychological fatigue, and that 'redemption' is clearly an external act of grace."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon explicitly mentions the 'danger you are in' and the 'killing in which we are much practiced'. It takes the human choice seriously, though it leans toward 'temporal loss' (societal collapse) rather than eternal loss.",
      "quotes": [
        "Recognize the danger you are in and change.",
        "the staggering possibility of choosing real life and turning away from the killing in which we are much practiced."

      "improvement_point": "Clarify the ultimate stakes of the 'two ways'. Is this merely about a better society, or about man's destination before God?"

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the one who must increase, but He functions more as a symbol of 'new life-giving power' than as the incarnate God-Man. The sermon risks moralism by focusing on the 'daily disciplines' of the hearer rather than the finished work of Christ.",
      "quotes": [
        "Decrease what is greedy... for the increase of simple, life-giving sharing.",
        "God will do much... But God will not do our work of redeciding our life."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make Christ the telos. Instead of focusing on the hearer's 'work of redeciding', focus on how Christ’s life replaces the hearer’s life (salvation outside oneself)."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1050 words, the sermon would last about 10-11 minutes. According to Dekker/Miskotte, this lacks the 'breadth' necessary for true theological depth.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the sermon to at least 20 minutes. Use the additional time for deeper exegesis of the Hebrew text and a more thorough dogmatic grounding."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily due to its brevity, lack of rigorous exegesis, and a tendency toward moralism. It treats the Bible passage as a thematic springboard for a psychological and social call to action rather than an actualization of the Word of God. While the contemporary application is vivid, it lacks the necessary dogmatic weight and Christological focus required for a sermon that 'detaches man from himself'.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete social application regarding housing and economic injustice.",
      "Clear thematic structure that attempts to bridge Old and New Testament figures.",
      "Sober acknowledgment of human cynicism and fatigue."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (10 minutes) prevents theological depth.",
      "Complete absence of original context, Hebrew/Greek, or historical exegesis.",
      "Moralistic tone that emphasizes human 'redeciding' over the objective grace of Christ."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is a compelling religious speech or a 'meditation' on a biblical theme, but it lacks the formal requirements of exposition and the substantive requirement of being a form of the Word of God rooted in a specific pericope."
