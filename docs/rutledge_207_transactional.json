    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "While intellectually stimulating and homiletically 'clever,' the sermon is psychologically taxing. It utilizes a sophisticated 'NIGYSOB' game to dismantle the listener's ego. By intentionally withholding the 'Rescuer' role (the Gospel) until a future date, the preacher creates an unhealthy dependency and leaves the congregation in a state of 'Adapted Child' guilt. The use of the General Confession as a 'payoff' solidifies the 'I'm Not OK' position of the listener.",

      "High Adult ego engagement through literary and historical references.",
      "Effective dismantling of 'Ain't It Awful' (judging others) by turning the mirror on the self."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The intentional withholding of resolution (Grace) is a manipulative 'cliffhanger' technique.",
      "The heavy reliance on Critical Parent language ('guilty,' 'miserable') can trigger trauma rather than transformation."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward Adult-Adult communication, offer the 'solution' (Grace) alongside the 'problem' (Sin) in the same transaction. Avoid 'trapping' the listener; instead, present the reality of sin as a data point for Adult reflection rather than a Parent's stick for shaming."
