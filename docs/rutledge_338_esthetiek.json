    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes concrete imagery primarily through the opening anecdote of the wood-carving at Kanuga and the comparison to the electric chair. These images serve as effective 'hooks' to ground abstract theological concepts like 'stumbling block' in physical reality. However, the imagery remains somewhat limited to these two poles. While the preacher mentions 'masks and makeup' and 'bank accounts,' the middle section of the sermon leans heavily on 'telling' rather than 'showing,' relying on lists of abstract nouns (cowardice, failures, fraudulence) rather than painting vivid scenes. The biblical world is evoked through citation rather than sensory reconstruction. Following Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' principle, the sermon starts strong but loses its cinematic quality as it moves into the doctrinal core.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' and precision. The preacher avoids the 'Canaanite jargon' often found in Good Friday sermons, instead opting for direct, modern English. There is a clear stewardship of language in how the preacher defines the 'Good' in Good Friday. The word choice is deliberate, particularly in the juxtaposition of 'awe-ful' and 'Good' at the conclusion. The preacher nuances the human experience by distinguishing between how 'man' sees (image, spin doctors) and how God sees (the heart). This precision prevents the sermon from falling into vague platitudes, though the repetition of 'he loves us' in the climax borders on rhetorical excess.",
      "quotes": [
        "Why do the spin doctors stay so busy? Why are the plastic surgeons making so much money?",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a strong oral quality, likely designed for a liturgical setting. There is a clear use of parallelism and repetition, particularly in the final section, which creates a liturgical cadence. The variation in sentence length—moving from short, punchy statements ('Paul was a straight shooter') to longer, cumulative sentences—helps maintain interest. The rhythm supports the content, especially the staccato-like delivery of the cultural critique. However, the repetitive structure of the final paragraphs, while rhetorically powerful, risks becoming monotonous if not handled with varied vocal inflection.",
      "quotes": [
        "Paul was a straight shooter.",
        "He sees us in the midst of our deceptions and failures. He sees us in the full dimensions of our weakness and mortality...",

    },
    "average_score_language": 6.67,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by a direct, 'straight-shooting' style that favors clarity and contemporary relevance over baroque ornamentation. The imagery is anchored in a few strong metaphors (the sculpture, the electric chair, masks) that effectively bridge the gap between the biblical text and modern experience. While the language is precise and the rhythm is well-suited for a liturgical event, the sermon occasionally retreats into abstract theological lists in its final third. Overall, it demonstrates a high degree of stewardship of language, avoiding jargon in favor of honest, sensory-grounded communication."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear dramaturgical progression. It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with the conflict over the 'depressing' sculpture, immediately raising the stakes: why are we here if this is so unpleasant? The movement follows a path from the 'outward appearance' (the mask) to the 'heart' (the reality), and finally to the 'Cross' (the resolution). There is a palpable tension between the world's avoidance of the Cross and the believer's need for it. The turning point occurs when the preacher shifts from our 'flimsy defenses' to God's 'unconditional gaze.' The energy is sustained through the use of rhetorical questions that keep the hearer moving toward the final 'Good.'",
      "quotes": [
        "One person said that the sculpture was depressing to her and she didn't go down to the lake to be depressed.",
        "This is the day to let go of our carefully constructed 'images.'",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. The preacher masterfully 'reframes' (Cilliers) the modern obsession with image and plastic surgery through the lens of Samuel, Jeremiah, and Paul. The context of North American consumerism is not just an 'add-on' but is the very frame that the biblical text deconstructs. The integration of the electric chair as a modern equivalent to the Cross respects the 'strangeness' of the biblical world while making it terrifyingly contemporary. The sermon does not just confirm what the hearer knows; it forces a new perspective on what it means to be 'good' or 'bad.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Why are the plastic surgeons making so much money? ... This is what 'man' sees.",
        "When people try to explain how grotesque the Cross is as a religious symbol, they often come up with the electric chair as an analogy.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward a more 'closed' structure, typical of the kerygmatic tradition. While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (the depressing nature of the cross), it ultimately provides a very firm, declarative answer: 'Because he loves you.' The hearer is guided through a specific logic with little room for alternative interpretations. However, the use of questions at the end ('Is it depressing? Is it frightening?') allows a small space for the hearer to bring their own emotions to the text. It is not 'sealed shut' in a moralistic sense, but it is dogmatically certain, which may limit the 'polyvalence' Stark advocates for.",
      "quotes": [
        "You are here today because the Holy Spirit has drawn you into the circle of that power.",
        "I will tell you. He sees a person that he loves.",

        "Acknowledges the valid human emotion of finding the Cross 'depressing.'",
        "The ending invitation to 'let go of masks' is an open-ended spiritual challenge.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The preacher's 'I will tell you' can feel a bit authoritative, closing down the hearer's own discovery process.",

        "The resolution of 'love' comes very quickly after the 'grotesque' description of the electric chair."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent/declarative, but with moments of existential openness."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics of the sermon are strong, driven by a compelling narrative arc that moves from cultural critique to theological revelation. The integration of text and context is particularly effective, using contemporary 'reframing' to make the ancient text speak to modern anxieties about image and worth. While the structure is somewhat 'closed' by its declarative certainty, the preacher sustains the tension between the 'grotesque' and the 'good' long enough to create a genuine dramaturgical event. It is a journey that respects the hearer's resistance while leading them toward a specific, grace-filled conclusion."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It explicitly attacks the 'kitsch' of modern culture (plastic surgery, spin doctors, the desire to not be 'depressed'). By using the electric chair analogy, the preacher intentionally avoids the 'pre-chewed' sentimentality often associated with the Cross. The comfort offered at the end is not 'cheap' because it is preceded by a sharp diagnosis of human fraudulence and the 'grotesque' nature of execution. It avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by calling the day 'awe-ful' even as it calls it 'Good.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential for kitsch in the 'He loves you' refrain is mitigated by the preceding 'electric chair' imagery.",

      "The admission that the Cross is 'grotesque' and 'depressing' to the natural man.",

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully opens a 'space for grace' by first clearing the 'space of works' and 'image.' By deconstructing the wall between 'moderately bad' and 'really bad' people, the preacher creates a level ground where grace is the only remaining option. The mystery of the Cross is respected as a 'stumbling block' that cannot be reasoned away. However, the space is slightly narrowed by the preacher's rapid transition into explaining *why* God does this ('Because he loves you'), which can sometimes feel like explaining away the mystery too quickly.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'depressing' reality of death and the 'goodness' of the day is sustained until the final sentence.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery is framed as 'wisdom' that looks like 'foolishness,' honoring its paradoxical nature.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; there is almost no moralization, only an invitation to 'let go' and be seen.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'silence' of the Cross to linger more before providing the answer of 'love,' letting the grace feel even more 'unavailable' and surprising."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of contemporary kerygmatic preaching. Its primary strength lies in its 'reframing' of the Good Friday event against the backdrop of a culture obsessed with image and the avoidance of suffering. By utilizing sharp, sometimes jarring analogies (the electric chair), the preacher strips away the 'religious kitsch' that often coats the Crucifixion, restoring its 'stumbling block' quality. The language is precise, oral, and rhythmic, creating a liturgical event that feels both ancient and immediate. While the sermon follows a somewhat traditional declarative structure that limits interpretative polyvalence, it succeeds in opening a genuine 'space for grace' by ruthlessly diagnosing the human condition before offering the 'awe-ful' comfort of the Gospel. It is a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that finds beauty not in decoration, but in the honest encounter between the sinner and the Crucified.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful integration of contemporary cultural critique (plastic surgeons, spin doctors) with biblical anthropology.",
      "Effective use of the 'electric chair' analogy to break through religious familiarity and restore the 'grotesque' reality of the Cross.",
      "Strong oral rhythm and rhetorical structure that sustains tension from the opening anecdote to the final paradox."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase the 'showing' in the final third to match the cinematic quality of the opening.",
      "Allow for more 'openness' or 'silence' in the conclusion to let the mystery of the Cross breathe.",
      "Refine the transition between the Old Testament prophetic quotes and the modern application to ensure a smoother narrative flow."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Kerygmatic (with Narrative elements)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Witness' model of Thomas Long.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to modern, perhaps skeptical or 'over-churched' hearers who are weary of sentimentality and seek an intellectually honest, yet emotionally grounded, faith.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer in the 'between' of Good Friday and Easter.",
      "Use more sensory language (smell, sound) when describing biblical scenes to enhance the 'cinematic' quality.",
      "Incorporate a moment of 'resistance' where the preacher acknowledges how difficult it is to actually believe the 'love' message in the face of the 'grotesque'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon 'Not Bad But Good' is an aesthetically successful performance of the 'Aesthetic Turn.' It rejects the superficial beauty of kitsch in favor of the 'terrible beauty' of the Cross. Through precise language and a well-constructed dramaturgical arc, it moves the hearer from the 'outward appearance' of cultural success to the 'heart' of divine grace. While it leans toward a traditional authoritative delivery, its honesty and refusal to offer cheap comfort make it a compelling example of how homiletic aesthetics can serve the proclamation of the Word."
