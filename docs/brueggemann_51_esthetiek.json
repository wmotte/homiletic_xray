    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively utilizes the biblical imagery of the 'walking, leaping, and praising' man as a recurring visual motif. Brueggemann creates a sharp contrast between the 'impressive courtroom scene' filled with elite figures and the 'incontrovertible fact' of the healed man sitting silently. The imagery is not merely decorative but serves as the 'optics' (Cilliers) through which the audience is invited to view modern healthcare. While the sensory details of the healing itself are drawn directly from the text, the preacher successfully 'paints the picture' of the power structures—the rulers, elders, and scribes—as a stagnant, frightened block against the 'surging' energy of the resurrection. The imagery of 'regime change' and 'management' provides a contemporary mental frame for the ancient text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jumping up, he stood and began to walk, and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.",
        "The authorities always want to stop resurrection talk... because all resurrection data signifies that the world is under new management.",
        "Amid the bold apostles and the frightened authorities, sits this healed man."

        "The modern 'medical' side of the imagery could be more sensory (e.g., the smell of a clinic, the sound of a waiting room).",

    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably precise and free of 'Canaanite' jargon. Brueggemann practices 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre) by redefining theological terms like 'resurrection' not as an abstract dogma, but as 'present surging power.' He avoids the pitfall of vague religious sentimentality by grounding the 'good deed' in the concrete reality of healthcare. The word choice is economical; there is a rhythmic precision in the way he contrasts 'money/no power' with 'power/no money.' This binary structure forces clarity and prevents the message from being obscured by ecclesiastical fluff. The use of the word 'nuisance' to describe the early church is a precise rhetorical choice that strips away pious veneers.",
      "quotes": [
        "The news did not fit any of their categories and they could not file it away.",
        "We have reduced health care to money management and drug companies.",

        "Exceptional clarity in defining 'resurrection' for a contemporary audience.",
        "Avoidance of traditional pious clichés in favor of sharp, provocative language.",

        "The transition between 'alternative medicine' as a metaphor and actual medical practice could be more nuanced.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a strong oral cadence, characterized by the use of parallelism and repetitive structures ('always standing... always called... always stirring'). There is a palpable 'staccato' rhythm in the sections where he contrasts money and power, which likely translates well to a spoken performance (Immink). The sentence structures are generally short and punchy, avoiding the 'paper language' of academic theology. The repetition of the phrase 'walking and leaping and praising God' acts as a liturgical refrain, building a sense of momentum toward the conclusion. The rhythm supports the 'event' of the sermon, moving the hearer through the narrative arc with intentional pauses and accelerations.",
      "quotes": [
        "Always standing before authorities, always called to defend its life and its faith, always stirring up public interest.",
        "Power . . . and no money or money . . . and no power!",

        "Some paragraphs in section III are slightly long and could benefit from more rhythmic variation.",

    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by a 'sober beauty' and prophetic precision. Brueggemann avoids the 'kitsch' of flowery religious language, opting instead for a rhythmic, confrontational style that mirrors the 'public nuisance' of the early church. The imagery is grounded in the biblical text but 'reframed' through contemporary socio-economic metaphors. The language is economical and precise, fulfilling McEntyre's criteria for stewardship. It is a text that breathes through its oral cadences, making it an effective 'performance' of the Word rather than a dry lecture."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with the image of the church in court as a public nuisance. The tension is sustained by the prosecution's question: 'By what power?' The movement is not a static three-point list but a deepening investigation into the source of healing. The turning point occurs when the preacher connects the 'no money' of the apostles to the 'no power' of modern systems. This creates a 'climax' where the hearer must choose between two regimes. The conclusion offers a resolution that is also a 'signing on,' turning the narrative arc into a call to action. However, the movement between the three sections of Acts (Trial, Sermon, Healing) feels slightly like a reverse-chronological lecture at times.",
      "quotes": [
        "The news haunted people and left their lives on edge . . . so they summoned them into court to try to quiet them.",
        "Now things move to a quick finish.",
        "That is what we sign on for on this day with new resolve."

        "Strong opening that immediately introduces conflict and tension.",
        "The 'trial' setting provides a compelling dramaturgical frame for the entire sermon.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The jump back to Acts 3:17 and then further back to 3:6 can be slightly disorienting for the 'arc'.",

        "The transition to the 'health center' context could be integrated more gradually throughout the plot."

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. Brueggemann masterfully 'reframes' (Cilliers) the healing of the lame man within the context of modern healthcare economics. He avoids the 'kitsch' of a simple 'Jesus heals' message by placing the miracle in direct opposition to 'money management and drug companies.' The synthesis is surprising yet feels organic to the text's emphasis on 'silver and gold.' He respects the 'strangeness' of the biblical world (the court, the temple) while making it a mirror for the 'ruling arrangement of the day.' The sermon does not just apply the text; it uses the text to dismantle the hearer's existing frame of reality and offer a 'new management' perspective.",
      "quotes": [
        "What Peter does is to make a concrete linkage between the miracle of Easter and this practice of health care.",
        "We have reduced health care to money management and drug companies... the sick and disabled are lost in the shuffle.",
        "This alternative medicine is free... but it is also very expensive. It costs your life."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of the 'silver and gold' verse for a capitalist context.",
        "The connection between 'resurrection' and 'regime change' is a powerful interpretive move.",
        "The application flows naturally from the 'incontrovertible fact' of the healed man."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Could address the specific 'needs' of the medical staff present more directly.",
        "The critique of 'drug companies' is sharp but could be balanced with a word on how 'grace' works through them as well.",
        "The 'alternative medicine' metaphor might be confusing to those in the holistic health field."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing; it shifts the view of healthcare from a commodity to a 'resurrection action'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is rhetorically powerful, it leans toward a 'closed' structure in its prophetic certainty. The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long), which is effective, but there is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' (Stark) regarding those who are *not* healed. The sermon presents a sharp binary: the 'frightened authorities' vs. the 'bold apostles.' While this is dramaturgically strong, it leaves less room for the hearer who might feel caught in the middle or who struggles with the silence of God in the face of disability. However, the ending is 'open' in the sense that it is an invitation to 'sign on' to a continuing practice rather than a sealed dogmatic conclusion.",
      "quotes": [
        "The news did not fit any of their categories and they could not file it away.",
        "We cannot keep from speaking about what we have seen and heard.",
        "It is promised and possible that every neighbor in need should be raised to new life."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The use of the 'unanswered questions' of the court leaves some room for mystery.",
        "The conclusion is an invitation to participate, not just an order to obey.",
        "Acknowledges the 'haunting' nature of the gospel news."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "More room could be made for the 'lament' of those still waiting for healing.",
        "The binary between 'money' and 'power' is aesthetically satisfying but perhaps too 'sealed' for complex realities.",
        "Could end with a question that lingers in the 'between' (Cilliers)."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly monovalent; a powerful prophetic witness that leaves little room for 'resistance' or alternative interpretations."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is driven by a 'prophetic arc' that moves from the courtroom of the world to the temple of praise. The structure is not a static list but a 'happening' (Immink) that forces a confrontation between two worldviews. The integration of text and context is the sermon's aesthetic engine, successfully 'reframing' ancient healing as a modern political and spiritual act. While the structure is somewhat 'closed' by its own rhetorical force, it creates a 'space for grace' by insisting on the possibility of 'newness' in a world of 'damage control'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by emphasizing that this 'alternative medicine' is 'very expensive' and 'costs your life.' Brueggemann does not offer 'immediate comfort' without acknowledging the 'hostility of the establishment.' He explicitly rejects 'magical faith healing,' which is often a source of homiletic kitsch. The emotion is authentic because it is tied to the 'dangerous' and 'confrontive' nature of the gospel, rather than sentimental feelings about 'Jesus loving the sick.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The phrase 'marvelous occasion of celebration' (borderline, but functional).",
      "The 'leaping and dancing' could border on kitsch if not grounded in the 'trial' context."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The acknowledgment that the gospel is a 'public nuisance.'",
      "The stark contrast: 'Silver and gold have I none' vs. the multi-billion dollar healthcare industry."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the focus on the 'cost' of the gospel to ensure that the 'joy' of healing doesn't devolve into cheap sentiment."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by the insistence that 'new management' has taken over. By deconstructing the 'money scheme' of society, Brueggemann creates a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) where the 'unavailable' power of God can act. However, the space is slightly crowded by the preacher's strong rhetorical presence. The 'mystery' is respected in that the healing is called 'alternative' and 'beyond conventional medicine,' yet it is 'concretely enacted.' Grace prevails over moralization because the 'leaping' is a response to a gift, not a fulfillment of a law.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'old arrangement' and the 'new governance' is sustained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'how' of the healing is left as a 'notable sign' that cannot be denied but isn't fully explained.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the focus is on what God has 'unleashed' rather than what we must achieve.",
    "recommendation": "Allow for more silence in the text to let the 'mystery' of the healed man's silence speak more loudly."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the 'New Homiletic' with a strong prophetic-Reformed edge. Its primary aesthetic power lies in its 'reframing' of the biblical narrative. By casting the apostles as 'public nuisances' in a 'courtroom drama,' the preacher breaks the 'fixed frames' of the hearer, allowing the biblical text to speak directly to the socio-economic structures of the present. The language is 'stewardly'—precise, rhythmic, and intentionally provocative. It avoids the 'religious kitsch' of easy comfort by emphasizing the 'expensive' nature of the grace it proclaims. While the structure is rhetorically 'closed'—leaving little room for the hearer to disagree without siding with the 'frightened authorities'—it successfully creates a 'space for grace' by pointing to a reality that 'did not fit any of their categories.' The aesthetic of 'sober beauty' is achieved through the contrast between the silence of the healed man and the 'surging power' of the resurrection proclamation.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the biblical text within modern healthcare economics.",
      "Strong oral rhythm and precise, jargon-free language.",

      "Increase 'polyvalence' by acknowledging those who remain in the 'shadow' of non-healing.",
      "Smooth the dramaturgical transitions when moving backward through the Acts narrative.",

    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Show don't tell).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to hearers who are weary of 'cheap' religious talk and are looking for a faith that engages with public, systemic reality.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer in the 'between' of the trial.",
      "Use more 'staccato' sentence structures in the moments of highest tension.",
      "Deepen the 'imagery' by exploring the sensory world of the 'beggar' more fully."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically successful 'event' that honors the biblical text while fearlessly addressing the contemporary context. It scores high on language care and integration, though it could benefit from more 'openness' for the hearer's own struggle. It serves as a strong model for how to avoid kitsch in a celebratory setting."
