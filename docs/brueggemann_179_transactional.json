        "score": 8,

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the manipulative 'games' often found in homiletics. By utilizing a strong Adult ego position to analyze 'geography,' the preacher avoids the trap of the Critical Parent. The most striking feature is the portrayal of Jesus as a character who grows and learns (Adult/Free Child), which provides a healthy model for the listener to do the same without feeling shamed. It moves from a historical analysis to a contemporary application (Louisville) with transparency, maintaining an Adult-to-Adult transaction throughout.",
    "strengths": [
      "Models vulnerability through the character of Jesus.",
      "Uses the Adult ego position to dismantle 'purity laws' (Critical Parent structures).",
      "Promotes autonomy by highlighting the 'nobody' woman as the catalyst for change."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Nurturing Parent' tone regarding 'Martin' (MLK) could potentially slip into a 'Smothering Parent' if the listener doesn't share the same political framework.",
      "Could include more 'Adult' data on the specific needs of West Louisville to ground the 'Free Child' imagination."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' to process 'Parent' traditions. By showing how even the highest authority (Jesus) can move from a 'Parent' script to an 'Adult' reality-check, you empower the listener to do the same."
