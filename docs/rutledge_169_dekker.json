At the very beginning we hear the proclamation that the light of the incarnate Word of God comes to shine in the darkness (1:5). Repeatedly in this gospel, Jesus teaches that he brings light to the world [...] Open, we pray thee, the eyes of our faith, that we may behold him in all his redeeming work; through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon series follows specific pericopes, but often drifts into thematic treatments of 'darkness' or 'doubt' that could be applied to many texts. However, the focus on the specific detail of the 'linen cloths' in John 20 and the 'wounds' in the Thomas narrative shows an attempt to find the unique point of the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "It was the sight of the cloths that revealed to them what was otherwise unthinkable.",
        "Surely it is of the utmost importance that the sign demanded by Thomas was to touch the marks of Jesus’s wounds."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify more sharply what John 20:1-18 says that John 11 (Lazarus) does not; focus less on the general symbolism of 'night' and more on the unique apostolic witness of the empty tomb."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The exegesis is functional but lacks the linguistic and historical depth Dekker demands. While it mentions Jewish burial customs, it relies more on literary 'dramatist' analysis than on rigorous Hebrew/Greek-based theological exegesis.",
      "quotes": [
        "...as is the burial custom of the Jews...",
        "The mythology of the Greeks and Romans is by no means wrong here; the dead must cross over the black waters of the river Styx..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the specific theological weight of the Greek terms for 'seeing' (theorei vs eiden) in the tomb to deepen the 'exposition' beyond a narrative retelling."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest element. It avoids 'general truths' by grounding the text in the concrete reality of death (the Alabama tornado, the friend's daughter). It addresses the 'zeitgeist' of skepticism and the psychological reality of grief.",
      "quotes": [
        "In 1994, a church in Piedmont, Alabama, was destroyed by a tornado...",
        "You will come to know it in a hundred other ways, as the death of a friendship, the death of a career..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application remains bound to the text's specific resolution rather than general psychological comfort."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon moves back and forth between the biblical narrative and contemporary experience. It avoids the '15 min exegesis / 5 min application' trap, drawing the hearer into the 'night' of the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "This, in part, is what John’s Gospel means by night.",
        "Thomas stands for all of us here. We haven’t seen the risen Lord."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The transition between the 'Styx' mythology and the Mary Magdalene narrative feels somewhat detached; weave the 'present of revelation' more tightly into the textual details."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon excels in the 'misery' part, taking human suffering and the 'power of darkness' seriously. Redemption is clearly placed outside the self (Christ's victory). Gratitude is present in the liturgical responses and the 'comfort' of Job.",
      "quotes": [
        "The reign of Death is stark, merciless, irrevocable.",
        "He arose from the kingdom of Death and carried away its spoils."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The 'gratitude' (sanctification) aspect is slightly underdeveloped compared to the 'misery' and 'redemption' sections."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are largely absent. While it mentions a 'real choice' regarding which god to follow, the existential threat of being 'lost' (temporal or eternal) is softened into a choice between a 'domesticated pet' god and the real God.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have a real choice. We can choose a god who suits us..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the consequence of the 'broad way' more sharply. What does it mean to be 'lost in time' if one rejects the 'Who' that God reveals?"
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon explicitly links the resurrection to the divinity of Christ ('My Lord and my God') and emphasizes that life is found only 'outside oneself' in Him.",
      "quotes": [
        "Man has no life in himself, it is Christ who is his life.",
        "The living Son of God had appeared to him personally."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this focus in the Job section by more explicitly linking the 'voice from the whirlwind' to the 'Logos' who is Christ."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The combined texts provide sufficient breadth. Individually, the segments might be thin, but as a movement through the Easter season, they provide the 'breadth' Miskotte requires.",
      "improvement_point": "Ensure that the brevity of the individual sections does not lead to a 'keyword' approach (e.g., focusing only on 'dust' in Job)."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is strong in its psychological realism and its refusal to offer 'pious platitudes' in the face of misery. It successfully avoids moralism. However, it falls short of Dekker’s standard for rigorous linguistic exegesis and the 'two ways' of life and destruction. It leans toward a literary-thematic approach rather than a strictly proclamatory recreation of the specific Bible passage.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application: The use of the Alabama tornado provides a sharp, non-sentimental context for the Thomas narrative.",
      "Theological depth: Correctly identifies Christ as the telos and emphasizes the 'extra nos' nature of salvation.",
      "Serious treatment of 'Misery': Does not rush to Easter joy without acknowledging the 'cold clasp of death'."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of linguistic exegesis: No evidence of the 'Hebrew and Greek' requirement in the exposition.",
      "Weak 'Two Ways': The life-and-death seriousness of the hearer's destination is not sufficiently thematic.",
      "Generalization: The 'night' theme occasionally becomes a general idea rather than a specific exposition of John 20."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate sermon that approaches the status of a 'true sermon' through its Christocentric focus and concrete application, but it requires more exegetical 'labor' and a sharper focus on the 'two ways' to fully satisfy Dekker's criteria."
