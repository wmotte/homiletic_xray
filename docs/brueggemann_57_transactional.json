  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust, primarily operating from an Adult ego state. It deconstructs the 'Game' of religious manipulation (trying to bribe God) and replaces it with an invitation to authentic autonomy through gratitude. While it flirts with 'Ain't It Awful' regarding societal critique, it avoids the trap of shaming the listener, instead validating their capacity for 'wild gladness.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "Validation of the congregation's existing maturity.",
      "Clear deconstruction of manipulative religious 'games'."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The systemic critique (Ain't It Awful) could be more balanced with specific Adult-oriented solutions.",
      "The 'Wicked' section relies heavily on Critical Parent language which may trigger Adapted Child responses in more sensitive listeners."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' framing of the text (e.g., 'residue from worship') as it creates a safe distance for the listener to reflect without feeling coerced by the 'Parent' voice of the scripture."
