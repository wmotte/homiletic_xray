    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates a high level of biblical literacy, constructing a 'theology of the song' that spans the entire canon. The factual 'Sache' is the recurring theme of God’s subversive intervention on behalf of the marginalized. The exegesis of Exodus 1 (Shiphrah and Puah) is particularly sharp, highlighting the anonymity of power (Pharaoh) versus the named reality of the midwives. However, the 'blue' side risks becoming a mere catalogue of verses in Section III. While the intellectual connections are brilliant, the sheer volume of citations may overwhelm the listener's ability to process the specific 'Sache' of each text, potentially reducing complex theological witness to a singular, flattened motif of 'newness'.",
      "quotes": [
        "We learn of two mothers in the barrio who feared God and defied Pharaoh",
        "The sea is the residue of chaos, the anxious power of disorder and darkness",
        "Not one of these great jazz artists in our past has moved a cubit away from the sounds of Miriam"

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher exhibits a 'diaconal' self-revelation. He begins with a vulnerable admission of his own social location ('aging white guy', 'lead-footed'), which serves to decenter his authority in favor of the 'magic' of the music and the 'barrio'. This is a sophisticated use of the green side to establish credibility through humility. There is no 'hysterical' stage-seeking; rather, the 'I' is used to model the very submission to the 'Theme' that he advocates. He reveals a deep, almost weary passion for the church's integrity, which 'leaks' through in his sharp critiques of ecclesiastical bureaucracy.",
      "quotes": [
        "It required considerable anguish for this aging white guy",
        "That is the sum of what this lead-footed white man knows about jazz",

        "Lack of ego-driven rhetoric"

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship starts as one of 'solidary teaching' but shifts significantly in Section IV. The preacher moves from 'we' (the community of the song) to a more confrontational 'you' (the church that has grown old). He uses the 'yellow' side to provoke. There is a palpable tension between his self-identified 'outsider' status (white guy) and his 'insider' authority to shame the church. This 'relationship noise' is intentional; he is not seeking to be liked, but to be heard as a prophetic voice. The tone is paternal yet urgent, occasionally bordering on the 'paternalistic' when he lists what the song is 'no comfort' to.",
      "quotes": [
        "What has happened to this dear people of God that has grown old...?",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily 'directional' rather than 'moralistic'. He is not calling for specific tasks but for a fundamental shift in 'beat' or orientation. However, the ratio of Zuspruch (Promise) to Anspruch (Demand) becomes strained in the final section. The 'Shame on us' creates a heavy 'Red' signal of guilt. While theologically grounded in the 'foolishness of God', the appeal risks landing as a demand to 'be more jazz-like' or 'be less stale', which can feel like a new Law. The promise of God's faithfulness (Lamentations) is the final word, but the preceding 'shame' carries significant weight.",

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The promise is the 'Theme', but the demand for the church to 'get past itself' dominates the emotional climax.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Moderate. The call to 'not be stale' can become a new form of spiritual performance pressure.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a masterclass in canonical synthesis, using the jazz metaphor to unify disparate biblical witnesses into a singular 'Sache': the subversive newness of God. The preacher successfully navigates his own social location, using the 'Green' side to de-center himself. However, the sermon struggles with the 'Yellow' and 'Red' sides toward the end. The shift to 'Shame on us' is a sharp, almost legalistic turn that risks overshadowing the very 'Gospel' he seeks to proclaim. Theologically, it is a Barthian triumph in its insistence that the 'Song' is about the 'Other One' and not our own ambitions. Psychologically, it leans toward a 'Compulsive' need to correct the church, which may alienate the 'Depressive' listener seeking comfort. The 'Blue' side is overstuffed with citations, which, while impressive, may lead to cognitive overload, preventing the 'Theme' from truly 'swinging' in the listener's heart.",
    "barthian_warning": "The preacher avoids psychologization by repeatedly stating the song is 'not about us'. He maintains God as the Acting Subject.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Brilliant use of the Jazz metaphor as a homiletical 'cantus firmus'",
      "Sophisticated handling of race and social location",
      "Deep canonical integration"
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce the density of biblical citations to allow for deeper reflection",
      "Soften the 'Relationship Noise' in the final rebuke to prevent defensiveness",
      "Ensure the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is the functional power behind the 'Anspruch' (Appeal)"
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, intellectually rigorous, and prophetically urgent sermon that occasionally sacrifices communicative 'swing' for theological 'strictness'."
