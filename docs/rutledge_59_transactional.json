    "summary": "This sermon is a model of psychologically healthy homiletics. It avoids the common 'Bait & Switch' of religious discourse. Instead of using Job's suffering to shame the listener (Critical Parent), the preacher uses the Adult ego state to explore the 'wonderful' mystery of God. By validating the 'dust' of the human condition, she creates a safe space for the listener's Free Child to experience wonder without the pressure of having to 'understand' or 'fix' their situation. The transition from the trauma of Katrina to the hope of Baptism is handled with Adult clarity rather than Nurturing Parent sentimentality.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name the 'no-answer' in difficult texts; it prevents the ITHY game and builds Adult trust with the congregation."
