Als je vrouw in het ziekenhuis ligt en je houdt veel van haar, dan zeg je toch: \"Ik mis haar zo.\" En je wilt elke dag wel gaan en heel de dag bij haar zitten. [...] O, dat dit kind uw Zaligmaker zal mogen zijn, en anders vandaag nog worden. Amen.",

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon starts strongly with concrete human emotions—missing a loved one in the hospital. It effectively bridges the gap between the biblical narrative and the hearer's life by using a recent family anecdote about a missing grandchild. This creates immediate emotional resonance. However, the 'experience' remains somewhat limited to the domestic sphere and doesn't fully explore the broader social reality of the hearers.",

      "analysis": "The preacher reflects on the human condition of 'getting used' to grace and the 'unbelief' that surfaces during trials. He analyzes the state of the local church ([plaatsnaam]) and why certain buildings close. While he asks 'why' (e.g., why are we indifferent?), the analysis often jumps quickly to a call for repentance rather than lingering on the psychological or cultural complexities of modern indifference.",

The 'big idea' is the necessity of Christ as Savior, but the logical connection between the 12-year-old Jesus and the atonement is made through sudden leaps rather than careful textual development.

    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of a pietistic-reformed homily that prioritizes the 'heart' and the 'glory of Christ.' It succeeds in creating a strong emotional connection through the narrative of the lost child, mirroring the hearer's potential spiritual loss. However, it falls short in providing a robust 'Reflective Observation' that engages with the complexities of modern secular life, often defaulting to 'unbelief' as a catch-all explanation. The 'Active Experimentation' phase is limited to traditional religious duties (church attendance, Bible reading), leaving the hearer's broader life-world largely unaddressed. The language is warm and direct, but the theological conceptualization relies more on traditional assertions than on fresh exegetical insight.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon effectively completes the first half of Kolb's cycle, excelling in creating a 'Concrete Experience' of spiritual longing. It is a strong example of 'priestly' and 'prophetic' tasks but lacks the 'wisdom of the sage' (interpretation) and 'servant leadership' (pragmatic equipping) required for a truly holistic learning experience. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'temple' and the 'street,' showing how the presence of Christ transforms not just the heart, but the hearer's daily social and ethical reality."
