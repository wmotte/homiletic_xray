    "sermon_start_end": "The Roman Empire was an economy of bragging rights that required aggressive, ambitious behavior to be best, and first, and biggest. It was a predatory economy of getting everything one could for one’s self at the expense of every other person. Does that sound familiar? [...] But, says the Psalmist, those who ask rightly, prosper. What better! What better than to prosper through right asking. That is the good news, very good news indeed!",

      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a historical-economic description of Rome and the US, which serves as a conceptual hook rather than a visceral concrete experience. While it mentions 'children' and 'Cincinnati' later, it lacks a primary narrative or a specific 'slice of life' that allows the hearer to feel the weight of the text before analyzing it. The emotional connection is secondary to the intellectual critique.",

The preacher pauses to analyze the 'why' behind human conflict, identifying 'learned habits of self-indulgence' and 'cravings that are at war within you.'

The 'Big Idea' is clearly articulated: right asking is a challenge to the dominant greed system based on friendship with God.",

It lacks specific, actionable steps for the individual hearer to implement in their daily life. The call to 'transform structures' is noble but lacks a concrete starting point for the average congregant.",

It excels in the 'Assimilating' quadrant, providing intellectual clarity and a compelling 'Big Idea' regarding 'Right Asking.' However, it falls short in providing a truly 'Concrete Experience' that grounds these high-level concepts in the daily lived reality of the hearer. The 'Active Experimentation' phase remains at the level of ethical imperatives rather than practical discipleship. While the sermon is intellectually stimulating and prophetically bold, its heavy reliance on abstract analysis may alienate learners who require narrative engagement or concrete action steps.",

      "Use more 'you' language to bridge the gap between social analysis and personal application."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong example of a 'teaching sermon' that prioritizes theological and social analysis. From a Kolb perspective, it is highly effective in the phases of Reflective Observation and Abstract Conceptualization, making it a valuable resource for the 'Assimilating' hearer. However, its diagnostic score is lowered by a lack of narrative grounding and specific practical application. To move from a 'good lecture' to a 'transformative sermon,' it must complete the cycle by inviting the hearer into a concrete experience and providing clear, actionable steps for the 'Active Experimentation' phase. The priority for improvement is the integration of the 'Narrative' structure to balance the dominant 'Declarative' tone."
