While theologically traditional regarding the brevity of life, it systematically deconstructs the listener's Adult ego (competence, jobs, planning) to induce a state of helpless Adapted Child. The transition to 'hope' is a classic 'Bait and Switch' where the comfort offered is only accessible after the preacher has successfully made the listener feel 'feeble' and 'small.'",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as Adult partners in the face of mortality. Instead of 'You are small and avoidant,' try 'We all face the challenge of finding meaning in a finite life; how might we process this reality together?' Avoid shaming psychological defenses; acknowledge them as natural and invite the Adult to look past them."
