    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's requirement of focusing on one specific pericope. It functions more as a thematic speech on 'angels' using a collage of texts (Joshua, Luke, Hebrews, Judges, Isaiah, Kings, Daniel, Revelation). It does not find what is unique to Joshua 5 that exists nowhere else; instead, it uses Joshua as one example among many to prove a general theological point.",
      "quotes": [
        "In order to understand what angels are, we need to understand what they are not.",
        "Look at the various Biblical references to angels.",
        "The angel in the book of Joshua has been variously identified."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Discard the thematic survey of angels. Focus exclusively on the 'No' of the captain in Joshua 5:14. Explore the specific literary and historical context of the conquest of Jericho to find the unique word of God in this specific encounter."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is almost no technical exegesis. The preacher relies on art history, cultural commentary, and literary quotes (Byron, Rilke) rather than the Hebrew text or the specific theology of the book of Joshua. The original context of the Israelite conquest is barely touched upon.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have to go back to Byzantine, Romanesque, and medieval art to find the best representations.",
        "The rabbis of early centuries thought he was Michael the archangel."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Engage with the Hebrew text. Analyze the significance of the 'drawn sword' in the context of the Ban (herem) and the transition of leadership from Moses to Joshua."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part of the sermon. It sharply critiques the 'New Age' commercialization of spirituality and makes a very concrete political/social application regarding social service cuts. However, it occasionally slips into generalities about 'going through trials'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Christian people need to be a lot less focused on angel sightings and a lot more focused on the 15 percent cut in the Social Services Block Grant.",
        "Get in touch with your inner angel... America is in the throes of angel worship."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'No' of the angel in Joshua specifically to the contemporary political and personal 'categories' mentioned, rather than shifting to a general 'Yes' in Christ too quickly."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is interwoven, but not in the way Dekker envisions. It interweaves cultural critique with a thematic biblical study. Because there is no deep exposition of a single text, the 'movement' into the text is missing. The hearer is drawn into a 'topic' rather than a 'passage'.",
      "quotes": [
        "In the Time magazine article, a Catholic theologian is quoted... That’s very apt, and very Biblical."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Use the specific details of the Joshua text to 'expound' the hearer's current situation, rather than using external quotes to explain the Bible."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The theme of 'misery' (God's judgment, the 'terrible' nature of the divine) is well-represented. Redemption is found in Christ's presence in the 'fire'. Gratitude is less explicit but implied in the concluding doxology.",
      "quotes": [
        "You see, God has a case against us. That is why his presence causes dread.",
        "He is with us in the flame."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by showing how our 'categories' (Republican/Democrat, etc.) are not just mistakes but part of our rebellion against God's sovereignty."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on judgment and the 'Angel of Death', but it quickly moves to comfort. The 'No' of the angel is a missed opportunity to emphasize the 'two ways'. The seriousness of being 'lost' is hinted at through social neglect but not fully realized as a life-design choice.",
      "quotes": [
        "God’s judgment is encased in his mercy.",
        "The angel of death is no match for the resurrection of the dead."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The 'No' of the angel to Joshua is a moment of crisis. The preacher should emphasize that if God is not 'for us' on our terms, we are at risk of being against Him. This choice must be made concrete."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is explicitly Christocentric, identifying the angel as a pre-incarnate Christ. It correctly identifies Christ as the 'telos' and the 'Yes' of God. It avoids a purely 'therapeutic' Jesus by emphasizing His role as Commander.",
      "quotes": [
        "For in the last analysis, the true test of an angelic appearance is quite simple: Does it glorify Christ?",
        "He is the one who embodies the conclusive and final victory of God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the transition from the 'No' of the Old Testament angel to the 'Yes' of Christ doesn't feel like a theological escape hatch that bypasses the difficulty of the text."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1450 words, the sermon likely lasts 14-15 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for true depth. The thematic jumping prevents the 'boring' but necessary deep-drilling into a single text.",
      "improvement_point": "Increase the length by at least 5-10 minutes by adding rigorous exegetical work on the Joshua pericope."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s definition primarily because it is a thematic speech about angels rather than an exposition of a specific Bible passage. It relies heavily on cultural commentary and a 'collage' of verses, which prevents the specific 'word' of a single text from being heard. While it is commendably Christocentric and contains sharp, concrete social application, it lacks the exegetical depth and the required length to be considered a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application: The critique of New Age angelology and the specific mention of social service cuts provides the 'true truth' Dekker demands.",
      "Christocentric focus: The sermon successfully makes Christ the telos of the message."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specificity: By treating 'angels' as a general theme, the preacher misses the unique 'nowhere else' word of the Joshua text.",
      "Insufficient length: At ~15 minutes, it lacks the 'breadth' required for homiletical depth.",
      "Lack of exegesis: The absence of original language study or historical-critical engagement makes the sermon more of a literary essay."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an engaging religious address with strong ethical points, but it is not a sermon according to Dekker’s criteria. It fails the formal definition of being an 'exposition of a specific Bible passage' and lacks the necessary duration for depth."
