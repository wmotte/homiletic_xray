    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably game-free. By utilizing a strong Adult ego state, the preacher bypasses the typical Parent-Child dynamics of the pulpit. He acknowledges the psychological resistance (vested interests) of the listeners without shaming them, which fosters an environment of safety and autonomy. The use of 'we' instead of 'you' prevents the preacher from slipping into a Persecutor role. The focus on 'joy' and 'astonishment' engages the Free Child of the listener in a healthy, non-regressive way.",
    "strengths": [

      "The term 'must have sung' is a slight Parent projection, though minor.",
      "Could further empower the Adult by asking more open-ended questions about how the 'revolution' looks in the local context."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue the 'moment of candor' technique. It is the most effective tool for breaking the 'Bait & Switch' game often found in revolutionary preaching."
