    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes a strong narrative 'hook' with the Cherokee legend of the two wolves, which immediately engages the hearer's imagination. However, the experience remains somewhat externalized through the story rather than deeply rooted in a shared physical or immediate sensory experience of the congregation. It effectively moves from the story to the internal emotional state of the hearer by listing recognizable desires and failures.",
      "quotes": [
        "An old Cherokee is instructing his young son. 'Son,' he says, 'everyone has two wolves inside of them.'",

        "The identification could be deepened by a more specific, less 'list-like' description of a single concrete situation.",
        "The transition from the Cherokee story to the hearer's life is rapid, potentially losing the emotional weight of the metaphor."
      ],

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher resists offering a quick 'fix' and instead forces the hearer to pause at the 'why' of the human condition. He expands the reflection from the individual to the national and global level, analyzing the 'ugly America' and the 'bondage to decay.' He critically evaluates the cultural myth of 'the triumph of the human spirit.'",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The theological exposition is clear but brief due to time constraints. The preacher correctly identifies the Pauline 'law of sin' and the 'bondage to decay.' The 'big idea' is the total inability of the human will ('we have no power of ourselves'). However, the exegesis is more illustrative than explanatory; it assumes the hearer accepts the authority of the text without much logical scaffolding.",
      "quotes": [
        "St. Paul describes this conflict that goes on in every soul: 'I delight in the law of God... but I see in myself another law at war.'",

        "The logical connection between the 'wolves' and the 'law of sin' is asserted rather than argued.",
        "The transition to the solution (Christ) is very sudden, leaving little room for theological depth on how the 'Spirit of life' actually operates."

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. The sermon concludes with a theological celebration rather than a concrete call to action. While it points to the 'bread and wine and Word,' it does not provide specific steps for the hearer to 'feed the good wolf' or respond to the grace described. The application remains largely liturgical and internal.",
      "quotes": [
        "Who is going to feed the good wolf? Are you? Then why are you so neglectful of your obligations?",
        "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free... Here is food indeed."

        "Lack of concrete, ethical application for the 'Monday morning' context.",

    "conclusion": "From a Kolb perspective, this sermon is a strong 'Diverging' and 'Reflective' piece that excels at identifying and interpreting the human condition. It successfully moves the hearer from a concrete story to a deep reflection on their own 'wretchedness.' However, it is an incomplete cycle. By neglecting the 'Pragmatic' and 'Active' phases, it risks leaving the hearer in a state of theological awareness without practical agency. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'Spirit of life' and the daily 'feeding' of the soul with specific, actionable guidance."
