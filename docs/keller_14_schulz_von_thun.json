    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates strong exegetical control over the 'boring' genealogy. He successfully translates the ancient 'Sache' (genealogy as credential) into a modern equivalent (the résumé). The theological core—the fulfillment of the Abrahamic and Davidic promises—is clearly articulated. He avoids getting bogged down in the names themselves, instead focusing on the structural anomalies (the five women). The Barthian 'Living Christ' is present as the one who validates these names. However, the analysis of the 'fourteen generations' structure is omitted, which is a significant factual element of the text. The transition from the 'blue' facts of the text to the 'blue' facts of history (Tolkien section) is intellectually stimulating but risks shifting from exegesis to apologetics.",
      "quotes": [
        "In ancient times, it was your genealogy, not your résumé, that was important.",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as a teacher-pastor who is deeply concerned with the intellectual hurdles of his congregation (New York City context). There is a conscious 'Selbstdarstellung' of a well-read intellectual (referencing Tolkien, Lewis, Matthew Henry). The 'leakage' (Selbstenthüllung) suggests a person who values logic and historical groundedness over emotionalism. He reveals a personal conviction that the Gospel is not a 'fairy tale,' showing a certain impatience with 'once upon a time' spirituality. The 'I' is largely diaconal, serving the explanation of the text, though the intellectual pedigree of the preacher is clearly visible.",
      "quotes": [
        "I chose those words very, very carefully.",

      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive (Zwanghaft) with a touch of Schizoid. The preacher seeks order, correctness, and historical factuality. He values the 'concrete slab' of reality and structural logic. The distance is maintained through intellectual teaching rather than raw emotional vulnerability.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching' and 'Solidary'. He uses 'we' frequently ('we usually take a look', 'we don't understand'), which creates a sense of shared journey. However, there is a subtle 'from above' authority when he critiques the 'modern reader' whose 'eyes glaze over.' He anticipates the congregation's boredom and intellectual skepticism, which shows he knows his audience, but it also defines them as people who need his help to see the 'real' meaning. The tone is sober and business-like, appropriate for a 'killer résumé' culture, but it lacks the 'depressive' warmth that some might need in Advent.",
      "quotes": [
        "As modern readers, our eyes start to glaze over.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest side. The preacher masterfully navigates the Zuspruch (Promise) versus Anspruch (Demand). The 'appeal' is not a moralistic 'do better,' but a 'trust more.' He uses the 'red' side to call for a change in perspective: to stop judging God by human timeframes and to stop judging others by worldly résumés. The theological 'Gift' (Grace) is the foundation of the 'Appeal' (Identity). He avoids the pitfall of moralism by placing the prostitute and the king on the same level of need. The appeal is to 'reach for' the grace that is already there.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s foolish to judge God by our timeframes.",
        "Inside the Christian church, we must not be like out there in the world.",
        "No matter how low you are, you have God’s grace if you reach for it."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Excellent. The Zuspruch (God's grace to outsiders) is the absolute prerequisite for the Anspruch (don't be like the world).",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Low. The sermon explicitly fights moralism by equating the 'moral' David with the 'immoral' Rahab.",
      "strengths": [
        "Clear distinction between Law and Gospel.",
        "The appeal is existentially grounded in the Zuspruch."

    "disruptions": "A slight 'chafing' between the 'Yellow' relationship (solidarity) and the 'Green' self-revelation (the expert teacher). The preacher tells the audience they are bored, which might be a projection.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a robust, intellectually rigorous sermon that successfully navigates the tension between an ancient text and a modern, high-performance culture. The preacher uses the 'Blue' side (facts) to dismantle the 'Yellow' side's (relationship) worldly categories of status. By using the genealogy as a 'résumé,' he makes the theological concept of grace (Zuspruch) tangible. The Riemann 'Compulsive' type is evident in the structured, logical progression and the emphasis on 'fact' over 'myth.' The sermon avoids the 'Depressive' trap of non-committal warmth, opting instead for a 'Healing Disruption' that equates the religious insider with the moral outsider. While the Tolkien/Lewis section is a communicative 'Hysterical' flourish, it serves the 'Blue' side's argument for the historicity of the Incarnation. The Barthian requirement of God as the 'Acting Subject' is met: God is the one who keeps promises and includes the excluded. The sermon's primary weakness is a slight intellectual distance that may leave the 'Relationship Ear' feeling more taught than cared for.",
    "barthian_warning": "Low psychologization. The preacher focuses on God's action in history rather than just the 'experience' of the believer. However, the 'desires of your heart' section flirts with human-centric experience.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Masterful use of the 'résumé' metaphor.",
      "Radical application of Grace (David vs. Rahab).",
      "Strong historical-theological grounding."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Soften the 'intellectual authority' to increase pastoral warmth.",
      "Address the specific Matthean structure (14-14-14) to complete the 'Blue' analysis.",
      "Clarify the 'reach for grace' appeal to avoid a new 'Law' of effort."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, communicative, and theologically sound sermon that respects the intelligence of the hearer while challenging their moral categories."
