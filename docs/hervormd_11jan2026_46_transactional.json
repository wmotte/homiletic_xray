    "summary": "The sermon utilizes a classic 'Bait and Switch' dynamic. It begins by empathizing with modern psychological struggles (depression, divorce, social media envy), but instead of fostering Adult autonomy, it redirects these vulnerabilities into an Adapted Child's guilt. The 'Watchpost' metaphor functions as a Critical Parent tool to enforce religious attendance. While it offers comfort ('shards are gold'), it risks romanticizing suffering and promoting a 'Rescuer' dependency on religious structures.",
