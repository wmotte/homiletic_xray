    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and exceptionally game-free. It utilizes the Adult ego state to analyze the current human condition (anxiety under a superpower) and provides a historical/theological framework (the 'Rock') for the listener to regain their equilibrium. By avoiding the Critical Parent, the preacher prevents the listener from falling into a shame-based Adapted Child state. Instead, he fosters a sense of 'Free Child' wonder at 'impossibilities' while maintaining Adult responsibility.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' language to maintain the Adult-Adult peer relationship, and keep grounding theological claims in 'wonder' rather than 'dogmatic requirement'."
