    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a contemporary observation regarding the 'Jesus Seminar' and academic skepticism. While this provides a 'hook,' it is more intellectual than visceral. The strongest moment of concrete experience occurs late in the sermon with the story of the suicidal son. This provides a recognizable, high-stakes human situation. However, for much of the middle section, the hearer is kept at an analytical distance. The 'feeling' level is primarily one of intellectual concern rather than immediate identification with biblical characters.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength of the sermon. The preacher excels at pausing to ask 'why' and 'how' the current situation came to be. There is a sophisticated analysis of the human condition—specifically the temptation to be embarrassed by the 'unspiritual' nature of the Cross. The sermon explores the problem of 'literary presence' versus 'historical reality' from multiple perspectives, allowing the hearer to see the subtle erosion of faith in their own context.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is not at all clear on Sunday morning in the mainline churches of our land that Christ died for the ungodly. We all look pretty fixed up to me.",
        "Nowadays, however, there is so much emphasis on the refashioning of the text that Jesus, himself, becomes either a purely literary presence, or else a greatly reduced historical figure."

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a clear theological framework centered on the 'Christus Victor' and the necessity of the historical Jesus for the validity of hope. The exegesis of Romans and Mark is solid, connecting the 'shame' of the cross to the 'glory' of the Son of Man. The 'big idea' is clear: if Jesus is only a literary figure, he cannot intercede or save. However, the theological argumentation occasionally leans heavily on academic references (Cahill, Jesus Seminar) which may distance the non-academic hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "The passage depends for its truth on who Jesus is... If Paul is not telling the truth, then there is something that can separate us from the love of God and that is ourselves.",

      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. The sermon concludes with a prayer and a call to believe, but it lacks specific, concrete action steps for the hearer's daily life. The 'how' of not being ashamed in a secular workplace or social circle is left largely to the hearer's imagination. The call is primarily internal and cognitive (confession of faith) rather than external and ethical.",

It begins with a sharp cultural analysis (Reflective Observation) of the 'Jesus Seminar' and the mainline church's desire for respectability. It then builds a solid theological framework (Abstract Conceptualization) regarding the necessity of the historical cross and resurrection. The sermon reaches its emotional peak through a poignant pastoral illustration (Concrete Experience) that demonstrates the existential necessity of the theology discussed. However, the sermon falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase. While it successfully convinces the hearer 'what' to believe and 'why' it matters, it offers very little guidance on 'how' to live out this 'unashamed' faith in concrete, daily actions. The transition from academic critique to pastoral comfort is effective but leaves the 'hands' of the hearer largely idle.",

    "conclusion": "The sermon is a robust, intellectually satisfying defense of the Gospel that effectively addresses the 'Assimilating' learner. It successfully diagnoses the 'problem' of modern skepticism and provides a 'normative' theological response. Its primary failure lies in the lack of pragmatic application; it leaves the hearer with a renewed mind but without a clear path for their feet. To move from a 6 to an 8 on the Kolb scale, the preacher must bridge the gap between the 'amen' of the creed and the 'action' of the work week."
