    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates high theological competence by contrasting the 'Sache' of the Resurrection with naturalistic 'renewal' myths. Drawing on Barthian themes, the sermon insists on the radical discontinuity of the Resurrection—it is an act of God, not a cycle of nature. The critique of the Jesus Seminar and the 'One Hundred Ways to Avoid Saying That Jesus Christ Is Risen' provides a sharp, intellectual framework. The 'blue' side is not merely informative but polemical, serving to define the boundaries of orthodox faith against modern skepticism. It successfully navigates the tension between historical-critical embarrassment and the 'fides quae' of the apostolic witness.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Resurrection of our Lord is a radically discontinuous event having nothing to do with nature.",
        "The words 'Forth he came at Easter like the risen grain …' are a little bit deceptive.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a journey from 'Christian intellectual' arrogance to a humbled witness. There is a transparent admission of aging and the increasing weight of life's disappointments, which lends the sermon an air of 'diaconal' authenticity. The 'I' is used strategically to model the transition from doubt to faith. However, there is a slight 'Hysterical' tendency in the dramatic dismissal of the Jesus Seminar ('ineffable band of spoilers'), where the preacher’s own intellectual triumph is momentarily spotlighted. Despite this, the self-revelation serves the text by showing that faith is not a natural disposition but a gift received in the face of death.",
      "quotes": [
        "I wanted very much to be part of the cutting edge. I wanted to be recognized as a Christian intellectual.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship to the congregation is complex. The preacher begins with a welcoming, almost 'Depressive' (harmony-seeking) tone toward the 'C&E' (Christmas and Easter) Christians, but quickly shifts to a 'Teaching' authority. There is a 'paternalistic' edge when guessing the motives of the visitors (coaxed, intimidated, habit). While this creates a 'Healing Disruption' by challenging superficial attendance, it risks alienating the 'Relationship Ear' of the visitor who feels judged. The preacher positions himself as a seasoned guide who has moved past the 'idle tales' the congregation might still harbor.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The appeal is masterfully handled as a theological 'Zuspruch' (Promise). The 'Red' side is not a demand for moral improvement, but an appeal to *believe* and *trust* in the face of the 'inexorable' enemy. The sermon moves from the Law (the reality of death and the failure of naturalism) to the Gospel (the victory of Christ). The appeal is: 'Do not settle for spring myths; receive the Risen Lord.' It avoids moralism entirely, focusing instead on the 'fides qua'—the act of trusting the faithfulness of God rather than one's own strength.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a robust, Barthian-inflected Easter sermon that prioritizes the 'Sache' (the matter) of the Gospel over psychological comfort. The preacher successfully navigates the Schulz von Thun dimensions by using his 'Green' side (personal history) to bolster the 'Blue' side (dogmatic truth). He avoids the 'Depressive' trap of non-committal warmth, opting instead for a 'Healing Disruption' that challenges the congregation's likely naturalistic assumptions. The sermon is a masterclass in 'Zuspruch', grounding human hope not in 'renewal' but in the 'anti-natural' act of God. While the 'Yellow' side occasionally leans toward a paternalistic 'teaching' mode that might grate on the modern 'Relationship Ear', the overall congruence between the preacher's defiant tone and the message of victory over death is powerful. It avoids the 'Barthian Warning' of psychologization by keeping God as the Acting Subject—the Resurrection is something done *to* Jesus and *for* us, not something we 'experience' into existence.",
    "barthian_warning": "Minimal psychologization. The sermon explicitly rejects 'religious experience' (Garden of the Gods) in favor of the 'radically discontinuous event'.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological precision in distinguishing Resurrection from Nature.",
      "Authentic integration of personal grief and aging.",
      "Powerful, non-moralistic 'Zuspruch'."

    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Soften the 'guessing' of visitor motives to improve relational receptivity.",
      "Provide more 'Yellow' solidarity earlier in the sermon before the 'Blue' polemic.",
      "Clarify the 'defiance in daily life' with one concrete example."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, communicatively integral sermon that serves the Word with intellectual rigor and existential honesty."
