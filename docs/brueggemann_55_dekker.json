  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon stays close to the text of Matthew 11, specifically the 'gentle and humble' character of Jesus. However, it tends to dissolve the specificity of the passage into a general 'sabbath' theme that draws heavily from Old Testament motifs (Pharaoh, Miriam, Jeremiah) rather than what is unique to this specific Matthean pericope.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Jesus who speaks here... is contrasted to the condemned cities in the same chapter of Matthew 11"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more on the unique relationship between the Father and the Son mentioned in the preceding verses (v. 25-27) to ground the 'rest' in the specific Christological revelation of this text."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher shows awareness of the literary context (the contrast with Capernaum) and uses the term 'naphshim', suggesting linguistic study. However, the exegesis is quickly overtaken by a psychological/sociological framework (Pharaoh as a metaphor for modern stress).",
      "quotes": [
        "...unlike the creator we are too anxious to rest.",
        "Pharaoh, of course, has insatiable demands..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exegesis of what 'yoke' meant in the Second Temple Jewish context (Torah-observance) to contrast it more sharply with Jesus' yoke."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the 'zeitgeist' of anxiety and the 'pharaonic' nature of modern productivity. It speaks directly to the minister's life and the societal 'moral morass'. It avoids vague pieties by naming specific modern burdens.",
      "quotes": [
        "...one more pastoral call, one more committee meeting, one more careful preparation, one more street demonstration...",
        "neither Red nor Blue"

      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application remains anchored in the Gospel's promise rather than becoming a psychological exhortation to 'truth-telling'."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon moves back and forth between the text and the hearer's world. However, the 'Sabbath' concept acts as an external bridge that sometimes overshadows the movement of the text itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus invites people like us... away from our contradictions.",
        "Sabbath practice is to break the denial and become 'truth-tellers'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Allow the text's own movement (from revelation to invitation) to dictate the structure, rather than imposing a three-step 'truth/hope/sabbath' framework."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is strong on misery (weariness, denial, coercion) and redemption (the rest in Christ). Gratitude is present in the concluding 'dance'. It successfully avoids an overly objective Christocentrism by focusing on the human subject's exhaustion.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are weary with anxiety fed by our denial; we are heavy laden with coercion fed by our despair.",
        "You will notice and you will dance!"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Clarify that the 'dance' (gratitude) is a fruit of the Spirit, not just a psychological release of the 'true self'."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are framed as 'alternative existence' versus 'the way the world wants us to be'. While it mentions a 'visa to the Realm of Death', the gravity of being lost is somewhat softened by the focus on psychological well-being.",
      "quotes": [
        "Such silencing gives us a visa to the Realm of Death. We die a little every day in silence..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'lostness' of the condemned cities (Bethsaida/Capernaum) more directly to highlight the urgency of the choice."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the inviter and the 'telos'. The sermon emphasizes grace ('not a free lunch' but an 'easy yoke'). However, Christ occasionally risks becoming a means to the end of 'sabbath rest' rather than being the end Himself.",
      "quotes": [
        "...into the life of well-being with Jesus who is one with the Father.",
        "the one who is the truth, and the way and the life"

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1650 words, the sermon likely clocks in at 16-17 minutes. According to Dekker's Thesis 8, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for true depth.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical and dogmatic sections to exceed the 20-minute threshold, allowing the 'specific truth' of the text more room to breathe."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong rhetorical performance that identifies the modern 'misery' of anxiety and coercion with precision. However, it falls short of Dekker's standards primarily in its length (under 20 minutes) and its tendency to substitute a general 'Sabbath theology' for the specific, unique content of the Matthew 11 passage. The exegesis is present but quickly pivots to psychological and sociological application.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application to the specific 'weariness' of modern ministry and life.",
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' (misery, redemption, gratitude) as a background framework.",
      "Avoids 'general truths' by naming specific modern idols (productivity, ideological rancor)."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length to achieve the 'breadth' Dekker/Miskotte demand.",
      "The 'specific point' of this text (the Son's unique revelation of the Father) is overshadowed by broader biblical themes.",
      "The 'two ways' are primarily psychological (authenticity vs. alienation) rather than theological/eschatological."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate homiletical address, but it is not yet a 'sermon' in the full sense of Dekker's definition. It lacks the necessary breadth (duration) and specific exegetical depth to move beyond a thematic reflection on rest toward a truly proclamatory word of God derived solely from this pericope."
