    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically heavy, relying on a 'Critical Parent' to 'Adapted Child' dynamic. It utilizes a 'Bait & Switch' technique where the initial comfort of the Incarnation is quickly replaced by a demand for guilt and a focus on blood sacrifice. While theologically traditional, the psychological impact is one of creating dependency and reinforcing a 'not-OK' status for the listener.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try speaking from the Adult ego state: instead of telling the congregation what they 'must' feel, ask them what they observe in the text. Move from 'You should take an example' to 'What happens in us when we see this example?'"
