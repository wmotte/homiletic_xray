    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a rare example of psychologically healthy homiletics. It avoids the common trap of using the pulpit as a Critical Parent to shame the 'sinful' Child. Instead, it uses the Adult ego state to process the reality of death and the historical/theological data of the texts. By citing von Moltke, the preacher provides a model of an 'Adult' Christian who makes 'small decisions' rather than a 'Rescuer' hero. The impact is one of empowerment and invitation rather than coercion.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of intellectual honesty and Adult-Adult engagement.",

      "Transparent admission of the preacher's own existential questions."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the 'arid' reality of death to the 'majestic' promise could be seen as a psychological 'Rescue' if not for the final question which leaves the responsibility with the listener."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'I-position' (sharing personal struggle) to maintain a horizontal relationship with the congregation. Keep the focus on the 'Question' (inviting Adult reflection) rather than the 'Command' (inviting Adapted Child compliance)."
