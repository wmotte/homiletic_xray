While it starts with an 'Adult' engagement with archaeology, it quickly pivots to a 'Drama Triangle' where the preacher Rescues the congregation from the 'Bible-debunkers' by demanding a binary, non-rational submission to the Resurrection. The use of the deceased Cook Kimball's voice serves as a powerful emotional 'Crossup' that makes critical Adult reflection feel like a betrayal of the dead.",
