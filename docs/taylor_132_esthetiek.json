    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily through character sketches and anecdotal snapshots. The opening scene on a golf course and the description of New York's 'gay, giddy whirl' provide a cinematic quality consistent with Paul Scott Wilson’s 'showing' technique. However, the imagery becomes more conventional when discussing the biblical figures. Abraham's 'luminous finger' and Isaac's 'clogged wells' are effective but lean toward established homiletical tropes. The imagery serves as a bridge between the mundane (golf, traffic, horses) and the theological (God's care), though it occasionally lacks the sensory 'stench' or 'grit' that would elevate it to a higher aesthetic tier. It is more illustrative than evocative.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably clear and avoids dense 'Canaanite' jargon, favoring a mid-century rhetorical elegance. There is a stewardship of language that respects the hearer's intellect while remaining accessible. The preacher uses colloquialisms ('living it up', 'slick, smart ones') to bridge the gap between the sacred text and the street. Precision is found in the characterization of the three patriarchs—Abraham as 'big business', Isaac as 'commonplace', and Jacob as 'playing the angles'. While the language is not highly poetic in a literary sense, it is precise in its pastoral intent, hitting the 'core' of human experience as McEntyre suggests.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest micro-aesthetic feature. It possesses a distinct 'Black Homiletic' or 'Southern Oratory' cadence, characterized by parallelisms and a rhythmic build-up. The use of the refrain 'I am the God of...' creates a liturgical pulse. The sentence length varies effectively—short, punchy sentences for emphasis ('How right he was!') followed by longer, flowing descriptions. The inclusion of the hymn lyrics ('Mine eyes have seen the glory') acts as a rhythmic bridge, elevating the prose into a more musical register. It is clearly 'oral language' designed for the ear, not the eye.",
      "quotes": [
        "Abraham was a great and towering figure. He dreamed in the quiet land of Ur...",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high degree of micro-aesthetic competence, particularly in its rhythmic construction and oral clarity. It avoids the 'paper language' of academic theology, opting instead for a 'stewardship of words' that values the hearer's context. While the imagery is occasionally conventional, the precision with which it maps biblical archetypes onto modern social identities (the dreamer, the ordinary worker, the hustler) is effective. It is a 'sober-beautiful' example of mid-century oratory that uses language not for decoration, but as a transparent medium for a message of radical inclusion."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'Lowry Loop' to some extent, beginning with the 'upsetting' story of Tom, which introduces the tension of the 'lost' believer. The structure is then organized around the three names: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This is a traditional 'three-point' structure, but it is saved from being static by the narrative progression from 'Greatness' (Abraham) to 'Ordinariness' (Isaac) to 'Brokenness' (Jacob). The movement is a descent into the human condition, which creates a deepening sense of intimacy. However, the 'turning point' is distributed across the three points rather than having one singular dramatic climax, which slightly diffuses the tension.",
      "quotes": [
        "But something is haunting Tom, and he talked about it that morning...",
        "Well, let's make one last turn around this idea. 'I am the God of Jacob.'",

      "strengths": [
        "The opening anecdote immediately establishes a 'plot' of return and redemption.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a masterclass in 'Reframing' as defined by Johan Cilliers. The preacher takes a dry, genealogical formula ('Abraham, Isaac, Jacob') and reframes it as a sociological and psychological map of the congregation. The context of the Civil Rights movement is integrated with remarkable subtlety and power—mentioning Martin Luther King Jr. and 'school closers' not as external political topics, but as part of the 'God of history's' work. The synthesis between the 'then' of Ur and the 'now' of New York or the segregated South is organic. It respects the 'strangeness' of the text while making it urgently contemporary.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Lord of heaven is the Lord of history, and he stands with those whose cause is just...",

        "Ensure the 'big business' metaphor for Abraham doesn't accidentally endorse a prosperity-only view of God."

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "In terms of Ciska Stark's 'Open Work of Art', the sermon is somewhat 'closed'. It is a sermon of strong proclamation and reassurance. While it acknowledges the 'haunting' of conscience and the 'pain in God's heart', it moves very quickly to resolve these tensions with the 'couldn't care more' refrain. The ending is an emotional 'closed' loop—it tells the hearer exactly where they fit and what God feels. While this is pastorally comforting, it leaves little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or the 'resistance' of the hearer. It is a monovalent message of inclusion that, while beautiful, doesn't invite the hearer into the 'struggle' of interpretation.",
      "quotes": [
        "No matter who you are... his word to you is, 'I couldn't care more for you'.",
        "There is an emptiness in God's heart that only you can fill.",

      "strengths": [
        "The invitation is warm and radically inclusive.",

        "Allow more space for the 'silence' or 'absence' of God that Tom might be feeling on that golf course.",
        "The conclusion is very definitive; an open question might allow the hearer to 'appropriate' the message more deeply.",
        "Avoid the 'happy ending' feel by acknowledging that 'coming back' (like Tom) is a difficult, ongoing process."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A largely closed work of art. It is a 'witness' (Long) that seeks to convince and comfort rather than an 'open work' that seeks to explore."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is characterized by a strong, relevant integration of text and context, particularly through the lens of social justice and personal identity. The narrative arc is a functional descent into the human condition, though it relies on a traditional three-point framework. Its primary weakness lies in its 'closedness'—it resolves the tensions of sin and social evil perhaps too quickly through a repetitive refrain of grace. While this provides powerful 'consolatio', it misses the 'polyvalence' of an open work of art, functioning more as a persuasive witness than an interpretive space."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon narrowly avoids religious kitsch through its historical groundedness. The 'couldn't care more' refrain flirts with sentimentality (the 'happy ending' syndrome), but the inclusion of the 'federal penitentiary', the 'school closers', and the 'cheating' of Jacob provides enough 'grit' to keep it authentic. However, the 'emptiness in God's heart' and 'shadow around God's throne' are borderline kitsch—they are pre-chewed emotional images that simplify the Divine. The sermon's depth comes from its social context; without the 'grapes of wrath' and the Civil Rights tension, the language of 'God's love' would feel much more like a clichéd sentiment.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The image of a 'shadow around God's throne' if one person is lost—a somewhat sentimental anthropomorphism.",
      "The repetitive 'I couldn't care more' which risks becoming a 'pre-chewed' slogan."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The mention of the 'school closers' and the betrayal of evil—this is 'authentic' because it addresses real, historical pain.",
      "The description of Tom's 'haunting' awareness on the golf course—a genuine human moment."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To increase depth, allow the 'pain' and 'haunting' to linger longer before applying the 'balm' of the refrain. Avoid over-sentimentalizing God's emotions."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully opens a 'Space for Grace' by dismantling the barriers of merit. By showing that God is the God of the 'ordinary' (Isaac) and the 'crooked' (Jacob), it creates a vast room for the hearer to exist without the pressure of 'Abrahamic' greatness. It resists the 'kitsch' of moralism (the 'we must' trap) by focusing on God's character ('I am'). However, it 'closes' the space slightly by explaining away the mystery of the resurrection in favor of a purely 'living' social application. The 'vertical' dimension of the Holy is somewhat flattened into a 'horizontal' dimension of social acceptance.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are mostly resolved; the 'trouble' of Tom's life is quickly met with the 'grace' of God's care.",
    "mystery_respected": "Low. The preacher 'explains' the three patriarchs quite thoroughly, leaving little room for the mystery of God's choice.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. The sermon is a strong rejection of moralism in favor of Divine initiative.",
    "recommendation": "Leave more room for the 'not yet'—the fact that Tom hasn't come back yet, and the 'school closers' are still active. Grace is most powerful when it shines in the midst of unresolved tension."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a robust example of mid-century American homiletics, blending the 'New Homiletic' focus on imagery with the 'Reformed' emphasis on the Word as an event of grace. Its aesthetic power lies in its rhythmic oratory and its ability to 'reframe' ancient biblical names as contemporary social identities. It excels in 'Domain A' (Poetics of Language) through its musicality and clarity, and in 'Domain B' (Integration) through its courageous and organic inclusion of the Civil Rights struggle. However, it is aesthetically limited by its 'closed' structure and occasional lapses into sentimental imagery (kitsch). It functions as a 'Sober-Reformed' performance that uses the beauty of simplicity to proclaim a radical message of inclusion. It is a sermon that 'shows' the God of the living by 'showing' the dignity of the ordinary and the broken person.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rhythmic and musical sentence structure that creates a compelling oral 'flow'.",
      "Masterful 'reframing' of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob into modern archetypes.",
      "Organic integration of social justice (Civil Rights) without becoming a mere political lecture."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase 'openness' by allowing questions and tensions to remain unresolved.",
      "Deepen imagery by moving beyond conventional homiletical metaphors.",
      "Reduce the repetition of the 'couldn't care more' slogan to avoid the 'kitsch' of sentimentality."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Dramatic with a strong Oratorical-Rhythmic pulse.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson. It also echoes Thomas Long's 'Preacher as Witness'.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers seeking identity, social validation, and pastoral comfort; particularly effective for those feeling 'marginalized' or 'ordinary'.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer with a lingering question.",
      "Incorporate more 'sensory' details in the biblical scenes to make them 'cinematic'.",
      "Dare to explore the 'God of the dead' (the silence of the grave) before jumping to the 'God of the living'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Aesthetically, this sermon is a strong '7'. It is a highly effective piece of communication that uses the 'aesthetic turn' to make the Gospel visible in a time of social upheaval. It avoids the dry abstraction of dialectical theology and the shallow moralism of the 'social gospel' by grounding its message in the character of God. While it leans toward a 'closed' and slightly sentimental resolution, its rhythmic power and contextual bravery make it a compelling example of homiletic art."
