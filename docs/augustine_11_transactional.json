    "psychological_health_score": 2,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically regressive. It utilizes a 'Self-Abasement' model of spirituality that reinforces a 'Not-OK' life position for the human and an unpredictable 'Critical/Nurturing' position for the Divine. By labeling the self as a 'torn sack' and 'corruption,' it bypasses the Adult ego state entirely, fostering a dependency that TA would categorize as pathological. The theological 'mercy' is used as a shield against a projected 'wrath,' maintaining a game-state of 'Please Don't Kick Me.'",

      "High emotional resonance",
      "Strong use of Free Child imagery in the 'ecstatic' sections"

      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult engagement",
      "Extreme devaluation of the human subject",
      "Reinforcement of the Drama Triangle (Victim/Persecutor)"
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as 'OK' individuals who can cooperate with the Divine from an Adult ego state. Reduce the use of shaming adjectives ('wretched,' 'miserable') which trigger the Adapted Child's fear response."
