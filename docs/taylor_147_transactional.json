        "presence": "High",
        "analysis": "Strong Nurturing Parent presence. The preacher emphasizes a God who 'pitieth' and 'sits where they sit.' It borders on 'smothering' by reducing the listener to a 'child' with 'toys,' but remains largely supportive of the listener's emotional state.",

      "presence": "Medium",
      "analysis": "The preacher uses literature (Wordsworth) and historical/social analysis (Civil Rights, Greek mythology) to process reality. However, the 'Adult' often yields to the 'Nurturing Parent' to provide emotional comfort rather than critical reflection.",

    "analysis": "The preacher primarily adopts the role of a comforting authority figure (NP) addressing a hurting, somewhat helpless listener (AC). The transaction is stable because the listener's 'yearning' and 'sorrow' are validated by the preacher's 'balm.'",

    "risk_explanation": "The risk lies in the 'infantilization' of the listener. By framing the listener as a child with 'toys' and 'childishness,' the preacher may inadvertently bypass the listener's Adult capacity for agency."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically supportive and avoids the common traps of religious guilt and shame. It operates primarily from a Nurturing Parent position, offering profound emotional validation. While it risks infantilizing the listener through the Patmore poem, it balances this with an Adult-level engagement with the social crises of the time (Civil Rights). The impact is one of 're-parenting' the listener into a state of hope.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of empathy and emotional resonance.",
      "Avoids the 'Persecutor' role common in many sermons.",
      "Strong aesthetic appeal to the 'Free Child' through poetry."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Child' imagery (toys, childishness) can undermine the 'Adult' agency of the congregation.",
      "Heavy reliance on the 'Rescuer' role may foster spiritual dependency."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward a more 'Adult-Adult' transaction, the preacher could ask more reflective questions that require the listener to process their own path to justice, rather than just 'waiting' for God to 'thunder down the road.'"
