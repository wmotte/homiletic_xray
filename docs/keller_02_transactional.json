        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher uses the 'test' not to condemn, but to invite self-diagnosis. There is a lack of dogmatic finger-pointing; instead, he uses 'we' to include himself in the struggle.",
        "quotes": [
          "How are you doing with this? Are you offensive and attractive or maybe neither?",

        "presence": "High",
        "analysis": "The Nurturing Parent is used to provide a sense of safety and belonging ('chosen people', 'special possession') without creating a dependency on the preacher himself.",

        "presence_of_adaptation": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher avoids creating a culture of 'compliance' by admitting his own failures and the difficulty of the task, inviting the 'Free Child' to respond to beauty rather than the 'Adapted Child' to respond to law.",

  "transaction_analysis": {
    "primary_transaction_style": "Adult -> Adult (Complementary)",

    "risk_explanation": "The only potential double bottom is the 'test' itself, which could be used by a listener's internal Critical Parent to self-flagellate, though the preacher tries to mitigate this with the 'Chosen' section."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably 'game-free.' It utilizes a strong Adult ego state to deconstruct the listener's feelings of alienation, reframing them as a healthy 'exile' rather than a pathology. By balancing the 'Critical Parent' requirements (the test) with a deep 'Nurturing Parent' foundation (unconditional love), the preacher avoids the 'Bait & Switch' common in religious discourse. The focus on 'Resident Alien' status promotes psychological autonomy and differentiation from the 'herd' (culture).",
    "strengths": [
      "High Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "Effective use of Nurturing Parent to provide security.",
      "Avoidance of the Drama Triangle by centering the 'Rescuer' role on a third party (Jesus)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'test' in section 2 could be slightly more 'Free Child' oriented—focusing on the joy of the good deeds rather than just the 'offensiveness' of them.",
      "Slightly heavy on the 'Adult' data processing, which may leave some 'Child' ego states feeling a bit dry."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' language to avoid the Persecutor role. Keep grounding ethical demands in the 'unconditional love' of the Nurturing Parent to prevent the listener's internal Critical Parent from taking over."
