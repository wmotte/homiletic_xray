  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and demonstrates a high degree of 'communicative purity.' It avoids the common trap of using guilt (Critical Parent) to motivate service. Instead, it uses the Nurturing Parent to provide a sense of security and the Adult to provide biblical insight. The preacher successfully balances the need for rest with the call to serve, preventing the 'smothering' effect often found in purely Nurturing Parent sermons. The transition from being 'fed' to 'feeding others' promotes psychological maturity and autonomy.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of the Nurturing Parent to build safety.",
      "Adult-level linguistic and historical analysis.",
      "Avoidance of shaming or 'NIGYSOB' dynamics."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Could engage the 'Free Child' more through more vivid, imaginative storytelling.",
      "Slight risk of keeping the congregation in a 'Victim' role by over-emphasizing their 'exhaustion'."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'we' language to maintain a level playing field. To further strengthen the Adult-Adult transaction, ask more open-ended questions that require the listener to process their own reality rather than just receiving the preacher's definitions of their state."
