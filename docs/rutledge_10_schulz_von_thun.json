    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates a high level of exegetical and dogmatic precision. The 'Sache' (the living Christ as our righteousness) is clearly distinguished from human moralism. The preacher correctly identifies the radical nature of the Hebrew 'filthy rags' (ritually unclean/menstrual cloths) without becoming gratuitously graphic, maintaining the theological weight of 'unfitness' before God. The transition from Isaiah's lament to Jeremiah's promise and finally to Pauline justification (Rom 9, Gal 3) is logically sound and avoids intellectualist 'teaching' by grounding the facts in historical and contemporary tragedies (Rwanda, arson).",
      "quotes": [
        "These filthy rags... are ritually unclean—contaminated, desecrated, unholy.",
        "The Lord is our righteousness! God has done and will do what his people cannot do for themselves.",
        "The scripture consigned all things to sin, that what was promised to faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe."
      ],

        "The connection between the Rwandan genocide and the specific text could be more theologically nuanced to avoid the appearance of using tragedy as a mere 'illustration'.",
        "The distinction between 'righteousness of the law' and 'righteousness of faith' could be even sharper for a lay audience."

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. Complex dogmatic concepts are translated into concrete, albeit dark, imagery."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a persona that is sober, somewhat disillusioned with ecclesiastical marketing, and deeply concerned with global suffering. There is a clear 'Selbstenthüllung' of a jaundiced view toward the 'friendly church' facade. The 'I' is largely diaconal, serving the message of human insufficiency. However, there is a slight 'Selbstdarstellung' of the 'well-read intellectual' (referencing books on genocide, CNN reports, and Thomas Cranmer), which risks creating a distance between the pulpit and the pew.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have become somewhat jaundiced about all this.",
        "I’ve been reading a lot of books about genocide...",
        "I haven’t been in Canada long enough to be able to comment..."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Schizoid mix. The preacher seeks correctness and structural integrity (Compulsive) while maintaining a certain intellectual distance and skepticism toward emotional 'warmth' (Schizoid).",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is mostly subservient, but the preacher's personal skepticism toward 'friendly' churches occasionally takes center stage.",
      "strengths": [
        "Honesty about personal cynicism regarding church PR.",
        "Avoids the 'Hysterical' trap of making the sermon about personal feelings."

        "The 'jaundiced' tone could be perceived as elitist if not balanced with more pastoral warmth.",
        "The mention of 'not being in Canada long enough' is a slightly awkward self-revelation that breaks the homiletical flow."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is characterized by a 'teaching from above' or 'prophetic distance'. The preacher challenges the congregation's self-image ('bunch of sinners and hypocrites'). While this serves the truth of the text, the 'yellow' signals are predominantly cool and diagnostic. The use of 'beloved of God' in the second half attempts to bridge the gap, but the earlier critique of 'friendly churches' may have already created 'relationship noise' for those who value their church community.",
      "quotes": [
        "Maybe we should try putting up a different kind of sign: 'This congregation is a bunch of sinners and hypocrites...'",
        "Have you ever done something that was meant to be kind, only to have it blow up in your face?",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest side. The preacher masterfully avoids the 'moralistic trap'. The appeal is not 'do better,' but 'acknowledge your failure and trust in The Lord our Righteousness.' The ratio of Zuspruch (Promise) to Anspruch (Demand) is theologically exemplary: the demand is simply to stop trying to justify oneself. The final appeal for the white people of Massachusetts to help is framed not as a 'work' to earn merit, but as a 'sign' of God's reign—a crucial Barthian distinction.",
      "quotes": [
        "These deeds will not be righteousness according to the law... These deeds will be signs.",
        "We are not saved by our own righteousness.",
        "God has done and will do what his people cannot do for themselves."

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Excellent. The promise (Zuspruch) is the absolute foundation; the appeal is a response of gratitude and 'sign-making'.",

      "strengths": [
        "Clear distinction between 'merit' and 'signs'.",

        "The transition to the specific Massachusetts example feels slightly localized and could be broadened for a general congregation.",
        "The 'appeal' to see ourselves as 'misfits and marplots' could be more gently invited."

    "disruptions": "The main disruption is the 'relationship noise' regarding the critique of church friendliness, which might distract the 'Yellow' ear from the 'Blue' message of grace.",
    "healing_disruption": "Yes. The deconstruction of the 'friendly church' is a prophetic disruption intended to strip away false security (theological 'Sache')."

  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This is a robust, theologically driven sermon that prioritizes the 'Sache' of the Gospel over psychological comfort. The preacher successfully navigates the tension between Isaiah’s lament and Jeremiah’s promise, landing firmly on the Barthian/Lutheran ground of justification by grace alone. The analysis of human 'righteousness' as 'filthy rags' is applied with razor-sharp precision to contemporary NGOs, politics, and church life, effectively stripping the listener of moralistic self-defense. However, the preacher's 'Green' side (self-revelation) leans toward a Schizoid/Compulsive distance, which may make the 'Yellow' (relational) aspect feel cold to some. The sermon is highly congruent: the sober tone matches the gravity of the subject matter. It avoids the 'American superlative' and instead offers a 'Healing Disruption' that challenges the congregation's self-satisfaction. Theologically, it is a triumph of Zuspruch (Promise) over Anspruch (Demand), correctly identifying good works as 'signs' rather than 'merits'.",
    "barthian_warning": "Minimal psychologization. God remains the Acting Subject (Immink). The preacher avoids turning faith into a 'human experience' and keeps it as a response to God's objective Word.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological precision regarding Law and Gospel.",
      "Courageous deconstruction of superficial church identity.",
      "Excellent use of contemporary examples to illustrate total depravity."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Softening the relational 'noise' to prevent alienating the 'Yellow' ear.",
      "Reducing the 'intellectual distance' in the self-revelation.",
      "Ensuring the transition between global genocide and personal failure feels more organic."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, communicatively honest sermon that serves the Word with integrity, though it demands a high level of 'Factual Ear' engagement from the congregation."
