    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating a 'cinematic' experience, particularly in the treatment of 'night' and 'darkness'. Following Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don’t tell' principle, the preacher paints the tomb scene with sensory weight—the 'cold clasp of death' and the 'linen bands'. The imagery of the Piedmont tornado (patent-leather shoes in ruins) serves as a powerful, devastating contemporary image that anchors abstract doubt in physical reality. The use of the 'river Styx' and 'black waters' provides a mythological depth that makes the 'descent into hell' feel spatial and visceral rather than merely dogmatic. The imagery is not decorative but structural, facilitating the 'reframing' of the Easter light against a backdrop of tangible gloom.",
      "quotes": [
        "The dead must cross over the black waters of the river Styx into the kingdom of darkness.",
        "A man looked at the little patent-leather Easter shoes of the children lying in the ruins.",

        "The imagery in the Job section is slightly more abstract than the vivid John 20 descriptions."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strongly weighted toward 'showing'. The preacher allows the image of the unwrapped winding sheet to 'reveal' the resurrection rather than just stating it as a fact."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is characterized by a 'stewardship of words' (McEntyre). There is a notable absence of 'Canaanite jargon'; when theological terms like 'incarnate Word' or 'resurrection' are used, they are immediately contextualized within the narrative flow. The preacher uses precise verbs ('dips', 'pervades', 'obliterated') that give the text a sharp, intellectual edge. The distinction between 'sentiment' and 'emotion' is maintained through precise naming of grief—not as a general feeling, but as the 'death of a career' or 'loss of health'. The precision in describing the 'linen cloths' as evidence of a non-robbery shows an analytical care that respects the hearer's intelligence.",
      "quotes": [
        "The master dramatist John tells us... he immediately went out; and it was night.",
        "This is not trendy disaffection. It is doubt that arises even in the midst of faith.",

        "Occasional use of 'one thing is for sure' is a slight colloquial lapse in an otherwise formal text.",
        "The term 'mythology' regarding the Styx might require more careful handling in some Reformed contexts."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Theological terms are used as 'living' categories. 'Incarnation' and 'Messiah' are woven into the story rather than dropped as technical labels."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The text possesses a rhythmic cadence that suggests it was written for the ear (oral event). The repetition of the phrase 'and it was night' acts as a liturgical refrain, creating a staccato of dread that resolves into the 'Alleluia'. There is a deliberate variation in sentence length—short, punchy sentences ('It was night.', 'Death rules there.') are followed by longer, more reflective periods. The use of parallelism ('the death of a friendship, the death of a career...') creates a cumulative rhetorical effect that mirrors the weight of human suffering. The sermon has a natural 'flow' that avoids the 'paper language' of a lecture.",
      "quotes": [
        "It was night. This is the night in which Sin and Death reign.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition to the Job section feels slightly more 'textbook' and loses some of the rhythmic drive of the first segment.",
        "Some of the longer parenthetical citations (e.g., John 19:38-42) interrupt the oral flow if read exactly as written.",
        "The conclusion of the Thomas section is slightly wordy compared to the sharp opening."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Decidedly oral language. The structure favors the 'happening' of the word over the 'reading' of a document."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are exceptionally strong, characterized by a 'sober beauty' that avoids baroque excess. The preacher uses darkness as a primary aesthetic 'frame', creating a sensory-rich environment where the light of the Gospel can truly 'happen'. The language is precise, avoiding kitsch and jargon, and maintains a rhythmic cadence that honors the oral nature of the worship service. It is a high-level example of 'stewardship of language' where every word contributes to the 'optics' of the faith."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with an 'upsetting of equilibrium' by emphasizing the darkness and the 'power of darkness'. There is a palpable movement from the 'tomb of hope' to the 'victory already accomplished'. The Thomas segment creates tension by validating doubt before moving to the 'Who' of the divine answer. However, because the text provided is a series of segments, the overarching arc feels more like a triptych than a single journey. The movement within each segment is strong, but the 'turning points' are sometimes more theological than dramatic.",
      "quotes": [
        "The liturgy of Holy Week is designed to show that as Jesus dies, every human hope is obliterated.",
        "Thomas stands for all of us here... We would like proof.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a prime example of Cilliers' 'reframing'. The preacher takes the 'strangeness' of the biblical text (the unwrapped cloths, the whirlwind) and uses it to reframe contemporary tragedies like the Alabama tornado. The connection is not forced; it respects the 'otherness' of God. The sermon does not 'smooth over' the text for modern consumption but rather forces the modern context to face the 'baffling, even infuriating God'. The integration of Job's 'dust' with the Easter 'life' provides a profound theological synthesis that feels both ancient and immediate.",
      "quotes": [
        "You don’t have to reject evolutionary science to understand the symbolic meaning of this.",
        "The man looked at the little patent-leather Easter shoes... If that don’t shake your faith, nothing will.",

        "The 'evolutionary science' remark feels like a brief, unnecessary detour into a different 'frame'.",
        "The connection between the 'river Styx' and John 20 could be more biblically grounded.",
        "The application in the Job section is slightly more 'teaching' oriented than 'witness' oriented."

      "reframing_present": "Strongly present. Reality is framed not by human 'explanations' but by the 'Who' of God's presence."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is aesthetically rich, it leans toward a 'closed' theological system in its conclusions. The preacher is a 'witness' (Long), which is a strength, but the 'Space for Grace' is sometimes narrowed by very specific dogmatic assertions. However, the inclusion of the 'baffling' nature of God and the validation of 'shaking our fist' provides an 'openness' to the ambivalence of existence (Stark). The ending of the Thomas segment is somewhat 'sealed' by the liturgical 'Alleluia', but the Job section re-opens the mystery by stating that God's answer is 'no answer at all'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The divine answer does not come in the form of a 'why.' It comes in the form of a 'Who.'",
        "I will be quiet, comforted that I am dust.",
        "We have a real choice. We can choose a god who suits us... or the Bible sets before us a baffling... God."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'Yes, Lord; I believe' response is presented as a somewhat coercive 'let our answer be hers'.",
        "The sermon could benefit from more 'open endings' that leave the hearer in the 'between' space.",
        "The theological 'choice' presented (man-made god vs. real God) is a bit of a binary 'straitjacket'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent but with significant 'cracks' where the mystery of suffering is allowed to remain unresolved."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are characterized by a strong narrative drive and a sophisticated 'reframing' of human tragedy. The sermon moves effectively between the 'stories' of Scripture and the 'stories' of the world. While the theological conclusions are firm, the preacher maintains enough 'openness' to the reality of pain and doubt to avoid being a 'closed system'. The dramaturgy is liturgical and high-stakes, making the sermon feel like an 'event' rather than a lecture."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a powerful antidote to religious kitsch. It explicitly rejects 'pious platitudes' and 'soothing explanations'. By focusing on the 'marks of the wounds' and the 'stench of the grave', it avoids the 'happy ending' kitsch often found in Easter preaching. The use of the Alabama tornado story is handled with 'authentic emotion' rather than 'sentimentality'—the preacher does not try to 'fix' the tragedy but allows the 'cries of pain' to stand. This is 'sober beauty' at its best, refusing to resolve the tension of the 'dust' too quickly.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential kitsch of 'Jesus is the light' is avoided by grounding it in the 'darkness' of Judas's betrayal.",
      "The 'happy ending' of resurrection is tempered by the 'wounds' that remain."

      "The friend who wanted a small portion of ashes just to 'be with' his daughter."

    "recommendation": "Maintain this rigorous rejection of 'easy comfort' to ensure the 'Space for Grace' remains authentic."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace precisely through the acknowledgement of the 'night'. By taking the 'power of darkness' seriously, the preacher creates a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) that is not a human achievement but a divine intrusion. The sermon sustains the tension between 'dust' and 'glory' without resolving it through moralism. Grace is presented as the 'Who' that meets us in the 'Why', respecting the mystery of God's sovereignty and the reality of human limitation.",
    "tension_sustained": "High. The tension between the 'man of dust' and the 'resurrection' is kept taut until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes. The 'voice out of the whirlwind' is allowed to be 'no answer at all', which paradoxically respects the mystery more than an explanation would.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. There is almost no 'moralizing' (we must do X); the focus is entirely on what God has done and who God is.",
    "recommendation": "Continue to resist the urge to provide 'explanations', as the 'no-answer' of Job is the sermon's strongest aesthetic moment."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically sophisticated work that exemplifies the 'aesthetic turn' in homiletics. It moves beyond the 'vertical' proclamation of the early 20th century to a sensory-rich, performative event that 'reframes' human suffering. The poetics are characterized by a stewardship of language that is both precise and rhythmic, while the structure follows a compelling narrative arc from darkness to a 'baffling' light. Its greatest strength lies in its 'anti-kitsch' stance; it refuses to offer cheap comfort, instead inviting the hearer into a 'Space for Grace' that acknowledges the 'cold clasp of death' while proclaiming the 'Who' of the resurrection. The integration of the Job text with the Easter narrative is a masterstroke of 'reframing', showing that the God of the whirlwind is the same as the Wounded Christ.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rigorous avoidance of religious kitsch and pious platitudes.",
      "Vivid, sensory imagery that 'shows' the darkness and the wounds.",
      "Sophisticated 'reframing' of contemporary tragedy through the biblical narrative."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Slightly coercive 'closedness' in the calls to confession.",
      "Occasional academic detours (e.g., evolutionary science) that break the poetic flow.",
      "The transition between the three liturgical segments could be more organically unified."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Poetic-Imagistic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Anti-kitsch) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Four Pages).",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who are intellectually skeptical or existentially grieving; those who find 'standard' evangelical cheerfulness manipulative.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'open endings' to increase the 'Opera Aperta' quality.",
      "Deepen the 'musicality' of the Job section to match the intensity of the Easter Day segment.",
      "Use the 'witness' stance to allow the hearer even more room for their own 'appropriation' of the text."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically 'strong' (7.8) example of contemporary preaching. It succeeds because it understands that the 'how' of the sermon—the darkness, the shoes in the ruins, the silence of Job—is the only way to authentically communicate the 'what' of the Gospel. It creates a space where 'the holy happens' not in spite of the dust, but within it."
