However, there is a slight CP tone when describing the 'burn-out' and 'exhaustion' of following influencers, which serves as a cautionary judgment.",

    "psychological_health_score": 7,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically supportive and aims to reduce shame. It successfully identifies the 'Adapted Child' struggle in modern social media culture. However, it relies heavily on a Parent-Child dynamic where the listener remains a passive recipient of 'washing' rather than an Adult agent of change. The use of 'we' prevents a Persecutor dynamic, making it a safe but somewhat dependency-promoting environment.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective use of 'we' language to level the hierarchy.",
      "Strong deconstruction of the 'Perfect Outside' mask.",
      "High empathy for the pressures on youth."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on the 'stained' metaphor can keep listeners in a 'Child' state.",
      "The transition from 'Influencer' to 'Pharisee' is a bit of a logical leap that bypasses Adult scrutiny."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Incorporate more 'Adult' ego state questions that ask the listener to analyze their own choices and boundaries, rather than just offering a Parent-led 'solution' of grace. Encourage autonomy by asking: 'How will you, as a thinking person, navigate your phone tomorrow?'"
