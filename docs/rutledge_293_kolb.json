    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively uses 'slices of life' to ground the message. It begins with a recognizable cultural experience (gift shops and greeting cards) and moves into a poignant, specific tragedy. The preacher successfully connects the liturgical season with the physical environment of the hearers (New England bare branches). However, it falls short of a 9 because it relies heavily on the preacher's own observations rather than inviting the hearer to inhabit a narrative space themselves.",
      "quotes": [
        "I was in a gift shop in an Episcopal church recently, looking for Easter cards.",
        "I know a woman whose child died in the spring. She says that each year the flowers and the fragrances are a torment to her.",

        "Increase identification with the biblical characters' sensory experience at the tomb beyond just 'grabbing up their skirts'.",

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength of the sermon. The preacher pauses significantly at the 'problem' of the text (the fear and silence of the women) and the 'problem' of modern culture (the sanitization of Easter). It explores the 'why' behind the women's terror, contrasting it with the 'soft focus' of modern expectations. It offers a sharp cultural critique of the 'Christmas syndrome' affecting Easter.",
      "quotes": [
        "What do you suppose they were thinking as they walked along the path?",
        "The impression given by Mark is one of real terror and utter inability to cope with the news just received.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a robust theological distinction between 'immortality of the soul' and 'resurrection of the body'. It engages with biblical scholarship (Markan endings) and Pauline theology (1 Corinthians 15). The 'big idea'—that Resurrection is an act of God from outside nature—is clearly formulated. It lacks an 8 or 9 because the exegesis of Mark 16:8 itself is somewhat brief compared to the topical theological discussion.",

        "Resurrection, in the Christian tradition, means something else.",

      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the sermon calls for a 'world-transforming view', it remains largely at the level of internal belief and 'trusting the witnesses'. There are few concrete action steps or ethical calls for the hearer's Monday morning. The application is primarily cognitive/dispositional rather than active. It tells the hearer what to believe, but not how to live out that 'trembling' in a specific way.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of a 'Declarative' and 'Visionary' approach that prioritizes theological accuracy and cultural critique. It successfully challenges the 'generic' view of Easter by contrasting it with the 'terror' of the Markan text and the 'unlooked-for' nature of resurrection. The preacher excels at 'Reflective Observation'—identifying why the gospel is difficult for modern hearers—and 'Abstract Conceptualization'—defining the specific nature of Christian hope. However, the sermon is imbalanced. It lacks a robust 'Active Experimentation' phase, leaving the hearer with a profound idea but few concrete ways to embody that idea in daily life. The 'Pragmatic' task of Osmer is the least fulfilled, as the sermon focuses more on what the resurrection *is* than on what the congregation should *do* in response to it. For the 'occasional' visitor, the sermon provides a high-intellectual entry point but may feel somewhat abstract in its final application.",

      "Simplify the theological jargon ('qualitatively different', 'epistemological order') for the targeted 'occasional' visitor.",

      "Experiment with an inductive structure that starts with the 'Active' problem and works back to the 'Abstract' solution."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a sophisticated theological reflection that effectively uses Kolb's 'Reflective Observation' and 'Abstract Conceptualization' to dismantle cultural misconceptions of Easter. It is intellectually rigorous and emotionally resonant. However, from a homiletical perspective, it remains 'top-heavy.' The priority for improvement is the 'Active Experimentation' phase. The preacher successfully brings the hearer to the empty tomb and explains its significance, but leaves them 'fleeing' or 'trusting' in a vacuum. To move from a score of 6.5 to an 8, the sermon needs to bridge the gap between the 'unlooked-for reversal' of the resurrection and the specific, everyday reversals required of a Christian disciple. It is a strong 'witness' but a weak 'guide'."
