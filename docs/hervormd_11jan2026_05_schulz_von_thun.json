    "sermon_start_end": "Gemeente, hoe vaak worden we in preken niet uitgenodigd om tot Jezus te komen? Vaak ook heel uitgesproken. En daarbij wordt ook nog wel eens regelmatig de uitspraak van Jezus aangehaald: 'Kom allen tot Mij, die vermoeid en belast zijn, en Ik zal u rust geven.' [...] Want Jezus nodigt ons uit. Hij nodigt ons uit om bij Hem te zijn, om bij Hem te komen, om bij Hem te blijven. En Hij nodigt ons uit om anderen uit te nodigen, om ook bij Hem te zijn. Amen.",
    "notes": "The sermon focuses on the invitation of Jesus and the subsequent call to invite others, using the narrative of Andrew and Peter."

  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a solid exegetical foundation by explaining the titles 'Rabbi', 'Lamb of God', and 'Messiah'. There is a clear attempt to connect the 'Lamb' to both the Day of Atonement (expiation) and the Passover (liberation from the power of sin). The distinction between 'sins' (plural) and 'sin' (singular as a power) shows theological depth influenced by the Reformed tradition. However, the 'blue' side remains somewhat repetitive. The explanation of the painting (likely Grünewald) serves as a helpful visual aid for the factual content, but the transition from historical context to contemporary application is often abrupt, relying on generalities rather than sharp theological insights.",
      "quotes": [
        "Rabbi betekent letterlijk meester.",
        "Johannes spreekt over Jezus als het Lam van God, dan zal hij natuurlijk aan het Paasfeest gedacht hebben.",
        "Het gaat over de macht waardoor alles wordt beheerst, de macht van de zonde."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear explanation of biblical terminology.",
        "Good distinction between the guilt of sin and the power of sin."

        "Avoid repetitive phrasing regarding the 'invitation' theme.",
        "Deepen the Christological 'Sache' beyond the 'invitation' metaphor."

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The language is accessible, perhaps even slightly too simple for a mature congregation."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a pastoral, cautious personality. There is a visible effort to remain balanced and non-judgmental, especially when discussing the scandal of the Christian leader. The 'I' is present but stays in a safe, 'diaconal' zone. However, there is a lack of raw, personal 'fides qua'. The preacher speaks about faith more than from faith. The frequent use of rhetorical questions ('Hebben wij ook die beslissing genomen?') suggests a desire for correctness and a slight hesitation to speak with personal authority. The self-revelation is 'safe' but lacks the 'leaking' passion that characterizes a truly authentic prophetic voice.",
      "quotes": [
        "Nu gaat het mij er niet om om die man vandaag te veroordelen, dat zij verre van mij.",
        "Ik zeg het maar even zo... ik zeg, het is misschien een beetje plat gezegd.",
        "Daar durf ik niet te zeggen [of de discipelen het begrepen]."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive-Compulsive. The preacher seeks harmony and avoids conflict (Depressive) while maintaining a very structured, cautious, and 'correct' theological framework (Compulsive).",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is subservient to the task, but almost to the point of disappearing into professional role-play.",
      "strengths": [
        "Avoids ego-centrism.",
        "Shows pastoral empathy and humility."
      ],

        "Show more personal existential 'skin in the game'.",
        "Reduce the use of 'qualifying' language that softens the message."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher-Student' or 'Elder Brother-Younger Brother'. The preacher uses 'we' and 'u' (formal) interchangeably, creating a respectful but somewhat distant atmosphere. There is a paternalistic undertone when addressing 'younger people' and their difficulty with commitment. The 'yellow' side suffers from 'relationship noise' in the form of moralizing questions that might make the hearer feel slightly interrogated rather than invited. The tone is solidary but lacks the 'eye-level' intensity of a shared struggle; the preacher stands slightly above the congregation as the one who knows the 'obstacles'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Vooral jongere mensen hoor je dat wel, dat ze het moeilijk vinden om zich ergens op vast te pinnen.",
        "Staan, is het misschien zo dat je zelf ook een zonde aan de hand houdt?",
        "Ik mag het wel even benadrukken. Ook in het focustraject."
      ],
      "relationship_noise_check": "The questioning about 'hidden sins' can feel like an intrusion if not balanced by a stronger sense of shared grace.",

      "strengths": [
        "Direct address to the congregation.",
        "Inclusion of different age groups."

        "Reduce the 'interrogative' style of application.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This is the most problematic side. Despite the theme being 'Jesus invites us' (Promise/Zuspruch), the sermon quickly devolves into a series of demands (Anspruch). The preacher repeatedly asks what 'hinders' the hearer, turning the Gospel invitation into a psychological hurdle-race. The appeal to 'invite others' at the end adds a layer of 'evangelistic duty' that can feel burdensome. The 'red' side dominates the 'blue' side; the 'Gift' of the Lamb is mentioned, but the 'Task' of following and inviting is what lingers. It risks moralism by making the 'decision' and 'action' of the human the focal point rather than the finished work of Christ.",
      "quotes": [
        "Hebben wij ook die beslissing genomen in ons leven?",
        "Wat verhindert ons? Welke hindernissen werpen wij zelf op?",
        "Wij zijn degene die geroepen zijn door wie Jezus anderen uit wil nodigen."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Heavily tilted towards Anspruch (Demand). The Zuspruch (Promise) serves as a mere setup for the call to action.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "High. The focus on 'taking time', 'making choices', and 'inviting neighbors' puts the weight back on the believer's shoulders.",
      "strengths": [
        "Clear call to action.",
        "Practical suggestions for daily faith."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Let the 'Zuspruch' stand on its own as the 'Acting Subject' (Immink).",
        "Reduce the pressure of the 'decision-logic'."

  "congruence_and_disruptions": {
    "congruence_judgment": "Incongruent. While the words speak of 'rest' and 'invitation', the tone and structure create 'pressure' and 'duty'.",
    "dominant_side": "Red (Appeal)",
    "disruptions": "The main disruption is the 'Law-Gospel' flip: an invitation (Gospel) is preached as a requirement (Law).",
    "healing_disruption": "None. The disruptions are mostly 'human clumsiness' in the form of repetitive moralizing questions."
  },
  "reception_simulation": {
    "the_factual_ear_hears": "Jesus is the Lamb of God who deals with the power of sin, similar to the Passover lamb.",
    "the_relational_ear_hears": "The preacher is checking if I am 'really' committed or if I am hiding something.",
    "the_appeal_ear_hears": "I need to stop being indecisive, spend more time in my 'binnenkamer', and start inviting my neighbors.",
    "the_self_revelation_ear_hears": "The preacher is a careful, somewhat traditional man who values church structures (kringen, focustraject)."
  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 5.5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a standard example of 'invitational' preaching that paradoxically creates a sense of obligation. Theologically, it aligns with Reformed orthodoxy, particularly in its explanation of the 'Lamb of God'. However, from a communication psychology perspective, the 'Appeal' side is overdeveloped. The preacher attempts to bridge the gap between the biblical text and the modern hearer by focusing on 'decisions' and 'obstacles', but this often leads to a psychologization of the faith where the human response becomes more interesting than the Divine action. The use of the 'scandal' illustration was risky; while it provided a concrete example of 'obstacles', it also introduced a judgmental 'noise' that distracted from the core message of grace. The sermon lacks the 'Barthian' surprise—the sense that God is the one doing the inviting, regardless of our psychological readiness.",
    "barthian_warning": "High psychologization. The focus is on the 'decision' and 'experience' of the disciple rather than the sovereign 'Call' of Christ that creates what it commands.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Clear exegetical explanation of the 'Lamb' imagery.",
      "Pastoral concern for the congregation's spiritual health.",
      "Structured and easy to follow."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Shift the focus from the 'human decision' to the 'divine gift'.",
      "Reduce the number of rhetorical questions that function as moral pressure.",
      "Develop a more authentic 'green' side by sharing the struggle of faith rather than just the 'correct' way to faith."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A satisfactory, safe sermon that fulfills the basic requirements of homiletics but fails to achieve communicative freedom due to an over-reliance on the 'Appeal' ear."
