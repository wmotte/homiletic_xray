    "sermon_start_end": "Palm Sunday is a very strange day. Its proper name is the Sunday of the Passion, because the story of Jesus' suffering and death is always read. I remember a teenaged boy, an acolyte in my former church [...] He is taking it with him as he begins his journey to Calvary. 'Shun not suffering, shame, or loss; learn of him to bear the cross.' AMEN.",

      "analysis": "The sermon is exceptionally strong in grounding the message in concrete, visceral experiences. It begins with a specific memory of an acolyte's confusion and moves into highly relatable human scenarios of grief and disappointment. The preacher avoids abstract 'suffering' by listing specific, painful family and social dynamics that evoke immediate emotional recognition in the hearer.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher facilitates reflection by pausing to ask 'why' we avoid the cross.

It succeeds in making the 'Word of the Cross' visceral and unavoidable by connecting it to universal experiences of grief and the cultural tendency toward 'easy' religion. However, it falls short of completing the Kolb cycle by failing to provide concrete, ethical 'Active Experimentation.' The theological conceptualization is present but serves the emotional 'vision' rather than providing a rigorous logical framework. It is an excellent sermon for 'Diverging' learners but may leave 'Converging' learners looking for more practical handles.",

      "Connect the 'Normative' task (what ought to be) more directly to the 'Pragmatic' task (how we respond)."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a powerful, emotionally resonant piece of homiletic art that excels in the 'Visionary' and 'Narrative' quadrants. It effectively diagnoses the human and cultural condition of 'fleeing the cross' and offers a moving theological vision of God's solidarity in the 'tears of Jesus.' From a Kolb perspective, it is highly successful in the first half of the cycle (Experience/Reflection) but loses momentum in the second half (Conceptualization/Application). The priority for improvement is to move beyond 'beholding' the cross to 'bearing' the cross through specific, concrete actions that address both personal and structural sin. It is a '7' for its depth and beauty, but a '6' for its lack of pragmatic completeness."
