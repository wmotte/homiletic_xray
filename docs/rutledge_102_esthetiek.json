    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon deals with the concept of 'glory' (doxa), which is inherently visual, yet the language remains largely conceptual. It discusses the 'uncreated light' and the 'dazzling garments' of Jesus, but often retreats into theological definitions (aseity, chabod) rather than sensory evocation. While it correctly identifies the need for 'showing' over 'telling' in its critique of other preachers, the text itself spends significant time explaining the mechanics of mediation rather than painting the scene for the listener's imagination. It relies heavily on the biblical text's own imagery rather than generating fresh metaphors to bridge the gap to the modern hearer. The imagery is 'correct' but lacks the 'living' quality Cilliers advocates for.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus appears in light so dazzling and unearthly that his garments shone whiter than any white known on earth",
        "The light that belongs to him has to be mediated to us... it is still an 'appearance'—one step removed from its essence.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and exhibits high 'stewardship of language' in the sense of McEntyre. The preacher carefully distinguishes between 'created' and 'uncreated' light and 'essence' versus 'appearance'. This precision prevents the sermon from sliding into vague sentimentality. However, the use of Latin terms (aseitas) and Greek (doxa, telos, idou) borders on 'Canaanite language'—academic jargon that may obscure the message for a general congregation unless the audience is specifically academic. The sentence structure is formal and disciplined, reflecting a high view of the Word, but it occasionally feels more like a lecture than a proclamation.",
      "quotes": [
        "This important theological concept about God’s being can help us understand the biblical epiphanies.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The rhythm is somewhat stilted and 'paper-like'. The sentences are often long and explanatory, containing multiple clauses that serve theological precision but hinder oral cadence. There is a lack of rhetorical figures like alliteration or parallelism that would make the sermon 'sing'. The text reads like an essay. The inclusion of the hymn at the end provides a much-needed lyrical lift, but the preceding prose does not build a rhythmic momentum toward it. It lacks the 'staccato' of action or the 'legato' of deep contemplation, maintaining a steady, academic 'moderato' throughout.",

    "average_score_language": 6.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic. It prioritizes theological precision and 'stewardship of the word' over sensory immersion or rhythmic beauty. While it successfully avoids the 'kitsch' of over-emotionalism, it risks becoming 'dry' through its reliance on academic jargon and complex sentence structures. The imagery is present but mediated through biblical commentary rather than direct poetic evocation. It is a text that respects the 'Majestic Glory' through intellectual care but lacks the 'musicality' that allows a sermon to truly 'happen' as an oral event."

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a thematic progression rather than a narrative plot. It begins with a liturgical observation, moves through exegetical analysis, and ends with an exhortation. There is no 'upsetting of the equilibrium' or a central 'problem' that the hearer feels needs solving. The 'conflict' mentioned is the 'ultimate contest' of the crucifixion, but this is discussed as a theological fact rather than a dramatic tension the hearer participates in. It lacks the 'Lowry Loop' or a clear 'homiletical plot'. The movement is more like a guided tour of a gallery than a journey from A to B.",
      "quotes": [
        "The arc of the Epiphany season comes to its close with a reading...",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is strong on 'text' but weaker on 'context'. It 'reframes' the Transfiguration not against modern life, but against the history of homiletics (critiquing the 1960s 'tone-deaf' preaching). The 'context' provided is largely the internal world of the church and the preacher's craft. While it mentions the 'valley of hard knocks', it doesn't populate that valley with concrete contemporary examples. The 'reframing' happens at a theological level—seeing the Sermon on the Mount through the lens of the Transfiguration—which is brilliant but remains within the 'stained-glass' world. It offers a new 'optic' for the Bible, but less so for the hearer's Monday morning.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is quite 'closed' and didactic. It functions as an 'Opera Chiusa' (closed work) where the preacher explains the 'correct' way to view the Transfiguration and critiques 'incorrect' (tone-deaf) ways. There is little room for the hearer's ambivalence or doubt; even the 'doubting' disciples in the Great Commission are mentioned only in passing. The sermon 'seals' the interpretation with strong theological assertions. While it calls for 'wonder and awe', it does so by *instructing* the hearer to feel it rather than creating an 'open space' where the hearer might encounter the Holy for themselves. It is a 'witness' that acts more like a 'teacher'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Such interpretations ignore the carefully crafted passages in the Synoptics.",
        "Without this holy fear, the scene loses its power and there is nothing to lift the hearers...",

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Monovalent and didactic. It seeks to transmit a specific theological 'truth' rather than invite an 'interpretation'."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 5.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is that of a theological treatise. It is logically sound and exegetically rich, but lacks the 'event' character that Immink emphasizes. The 'plot' is intellectual rather than experiential, moving through biblical themes with precision but without dramatic tension. It is a 'closed' work that prioritizes the 'correct' transmission of the 'doxa' over the 'open' appropriation by the hearer. The integration of text and context remains largely within the ecclesiastical sphere, missing the opportunity to 'reframe' the broader human experience of the 'valley'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is an excellent example of 'anti-kitsch'. It specifically attacks 'religious kitsch'—the tendency to turn the Transfiguration into a cheap moral lesson about 'getting back to work'. It refuses to resolve the tension of the 'uncreated light' with easy, pre-chewed emotions. By insisting on 'holy fear' and the 'confounding darkness' of the cross, it maintains an authentic aesthetic depth. It avoids the 'happy ending' by linking the mountain directly to the 'apparent defeat' of Golgotha. This is its greatest aesthetic strength: it takes the 'pain of the holy' seriously.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'tone-deaf' preaching that turns the mountain into an 'exhortation... to get down into the valley of hard knocks'.",
      "The 'self-congratulatory' use of Matthew 7:21."

      "The insistence that the glory is 'extinguished at Golgotha'."

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully opens space for 'Grace' by emphasizing that the transfiguration of human nature is a 'gift of God' and 'not achieved by human means'. It resists the 'moralization' that Cilliers warns against. However, the 'Space' is somewhat constricted by the didactic tone. While it speaks *about* the 'Space for Grace', it doesn't always *create* it aesthetically because the language is so tightly controlled and explanatory. The 'mystery' is respected theologically, but intellectually 'managed'.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'mountain' and the 'cross' is well-sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "Theologically yes, but the academic tone tends to 'explain' the mystery rather than 'behold' it.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails theologically; the sermon is a strong polemic against moralization.",
    "recommendation": "Use more 'silence' in the text—rhetorical pauses or 'open' imagery—to let the 'uncreated light' breathe."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically 'sober' and intellectually rigorous work that excels in its refusal of religious kitsch. Its primary strength lies in its 'stewardship of language' and its deep commitment to the 'doxa' of Christ as a theological reality. It functions as a powerful critique of superficial, moralistic preaching. However, from the perspective of the 'aesthetic turn', it remains too much of a 'paper' event. It prioritizes the 'Logos' (word/logic) over the 'Pathos' (emotion/experience) and 'Ethos' (performance). The structure is static and didactic, which 'closes' the work to the hearer's own interpretive journey. It is a sermon that 'teaches' the aesthetics of glory without fully 'performing' them. It is 'correct' and 'deep', but lacks the 'musicality' and 'narrative arc' that would make it a transformative 'event' in the sense of Immink or Wilson.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rigorous avoidance of religious kitsch and cheap moralism.",
      "Precise theological 'reframing' of the Sermon on the Mount through the Transfiguration.",

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Academic-Declarative / Sober-Reformed",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'form is content' rigor of Albrecht Grözinger and the 'anti-kitsch' stance of Johan Cilliers, but lacks the 'cinematic' quality of Paul Scott Wilson.",

    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Apply the 'Show, Don't Tell' rule to the 'valley of hard knocks'—give it a face and a name.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a high-quality theological reflection that serves as a necessary 'corrective' to superficial preaching. Aesthetically, it is a 'sober beauty' that draws attention to the 'Majestic Glory' rather than the preacher. However, its effectiveness is limited by its academic 'closedness'. It is a 6/10: a solid, reliable, and deep piece of homiletical work that 'meets' the requirements of the aesthetic turn but stops short of the 'polyvalent' and 'performative' excellence required for a higher score."
