    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a high-functioning Adult-to-Adult communication. It avoids the common pulpit trap of using the Critical Parent to shame the congregation into submission. Instead, it uses the 'Adult' to process the reality of 1990s New York and invites the 'Nurturing Parent' and 'Free Child' to respond to the gospel. It successfully deconstructs the 'Drama Triangle' by showing that Christ took the 'Persecutor's' judgment so that the 'Victim' (humanity) could become an 'Adult' (responsible agent of reconciliation).",

      "High level of Adult reality-testing.",
      "Avoids the 'NIGYSOB' game despite the easy targets of a 'sinful city'.",

    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Slight risk of 'Ain't It Awful' in the opening sociological descriptions.",
      "The transition from the 'parking ticket' story to the 'theology of the cross' is intellectually dense and may lose the 'Child's' engagement."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' language to avoid the Persecutor role. Maintain the balance of using secular data (Adult) to ground theological claims."
