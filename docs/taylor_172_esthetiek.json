    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in sensory imagery, moving beyond abstract dogma to concrete visualization. The preacher utilizes 'painting the picture' techniques, particularly in the fruitcake narrative and the description of 'Pops Swinton.' The imagery of 'trumpets sounding in the soul' and 'spirit standing on tiptoe' creates a visceral experience of worship. The use of 'peach tree switches' and 'rich, brown, luscious fruitcake' grounds the terrifying concept of judgment in domestic, tactile reality. This aligns with Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' principle; the preacher does not merely define judgment—he makes the hearer feel the 'gouges' in the cake and the sting of the switch. The biblical scenes, like the thieves on the cross, are dramatized with psychological depth, allowing the hearer to 'see' the spiritual desolation of the unrepentant thief.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strongly weighted toward 'showing.' The preacher uses the story of Rudolph Thomas to 'show' the inevitability of judgment rather than just 'telling' the congregation that judgment is certain."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is a sophisticated blend of high-oratory and folk-vernacular. There is a clear 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre) in the way the preacher avoids dry academic jargon while maintaining theological depth. Terms like 'probation,' 'arbitration,' and 'procuratorship' show intellectual precision, yet they are balanced by 'nitty-gritty' and 'rounder.' The preacher is careful to nuance the 'mercy of God,' correcting himself mid-sermon to ensure he does not misrepresent the character of God. This 'thinking aloud' demonstrates a high level of linguistic and theological responsibility. However, the use of 'beautiful belle and repulsive hag' feels dated and lacks the nuanced precision found in the rest of the text.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 9,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. The text possesses a rhythmic cadence typical of the 'chanted' sermon tradition. The use of parallelism ('no more time for praying, no more time for preaching, no more time for singing') creates a liturgical 'flow' that Immink would describe as a 'happening.' The sentence structure varies between short, staccato declarations ('Judgment Day had come') and long, flowing 'legato' passages that build emotional momentum. The repetition of 'There is to be a day!' acts as a musical refrain, heightening the 'dramaturgy of the word.' The sound value of the words—the 'l' sounds in 'lean, laconic' and the 'p' sounds in 'prince and pauper, preacher and pimp'—demonstrates a high level of rhetorical musicality.",
      "quotes": [
        "prince and pauper, preacher and pimp, beautiful belle and repulsive hag, banker and beggar",

    "average_score_language": 8.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high degree of micro-aesthetic mastery. It avoids the 'paper language' of academic theology, opting instead for a 'living' language that is both precise and musical. The imagery is grounded in human experience, making the 'unseen' world of judgment 'seen.' The stewardship of language is evident in the careful nuancing of God's mercy, while the rhythmic quality ensures the sermon functions as a performative event rather than a mere lecture."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'Lowry Loop' or a narrative plot rather than a static three-point structure. It begins with the 'equilibrium' of grand worship, quickly introduces the 'upsetting' reality of judgment (the fruitcake), and moves into the 'complication' of God's mercy versus human hardening. The 'turning point' is the tragic story of Pops Swinton, which serves as a cautionary climax. The movement from the 'small judgment' of childhood to the 'Great White Throne' provides a clear progression. However, the conclusion shifts somewhat rapidly from the 'terror' of judgment to the 'promise' of the new heaven, which slightly diffuses the tension built during the Swinton narrative.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher effectively 'reframes' (Cilliers) the ancient text of Revelation through the lens of modern experience (school exams, job evaluations, the quiet of the night). The integration of the 'two thieves' and 'Pilate' provides a historical-biblical depth that prevents the sermon from becoming merely a collection of anecdotes. The 'reframing' of judgment not as an arbitrary divine act but as a 'hardening of the heart' is an aesthetically and theologically sophisticated move. It respects the 'strangeness' of the biblical text while making it urgent for the contemporary hearer. However, the connection to the 'rap singers' feels like a 'forced' contextualization that doesn't quite match the gravity of the Revelation text.",
      "quotes": [
        "that period between going to bed and falling asleep, when conscience hauls out the deeds of the day",
        "Pilate... said, 'I cannot remember.' Think of it. He stood in the presence of the Savior of the world.",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "This is a 'closed' work in the sense of its moral urgency, yet 'open' in its psychological exploration. Stark’s 'open work of art' requires room for the hearer; here, the preacher uses the 'Pops Swinton' story to leave an open, haunting question: 'Can one go too far?' By not definitively stating Swinton's eternal fate ('I cannot say for sure'), the preacher leaves space for the hearer's own 'appropriation' and 'resistance.' However, the sermon leans toward a 'coercive schema' in its final appeal ('Today is the day of salvation!'). The 'happy ending' of the new heaven is presented, but the 'ambivalence of existence' is maintained through the tragic figure of the second thief and Pops Swinton.",
      "quotes": [
        "I cannot say for sure, but... I thought then, and I think now, that Pops Swinton had gone so far that he could not get back.",

      "strengths": [
        "The 'Pops Swinton' story is a masterpiece of 'open' narrative—it leaves the hearer in a state of holy fear without being manipulative.",
        "The preacher admits his own limitations ('I will not say clearly that the mercy of the Lord runs out').",
        "The ending 'God have mercy!' shifts the focus from the preacher's certainty to a shared human plea."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'Today, today is the day!' section feels a bit 'sealed shut' with traditional revivalist rhetoric.",

        "The sermon could benefit from more 'open questions' directed at the hearer's own experience of 'hardening'."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Hybrid. It uses 'open' narrative (Swinton) to drive toward a 'closed' theological appeal (Repentance)."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-structure is dynamic and narrative-driven. It avoids the 'three-point' trap by weaving together childhood memory, biblical history, and contemporary tragedy. The 'reframing' of judgment as a present reality of the heart is aesthetically successful. While the sermon ends with a traditional 'closed' appeal, the central narrative of Pops Swinton provides a haunting 'openness' that lingers in the hearer's mind, fulfilling the 'opera aperta' requirement by forcing the hearer to interpret their own spiritual state."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully avoids 'religious kitsch.' It does not offer 'immediate comfort without taking the pain of suffering seriously' (Cilliers). The story of Pops Swinton is the antithesis of kitsch; it is a story of failure, tragedy, and the 'unresolved.' The preacher does not give Swinton a 'happy ending' to satisfy the audience. Furthermore, the description of judgment is not 'pre-chewed' emotion; it is a 'stark' and 'laconic' confrontation with reality. The 'sentiment' of the fruitcake story is used as a 'trojan horse' to introduce the very 'unsentimental' reality of the peach tree switch and the Great White Throne. The preacher sustains the tension of the 'two thieves' without resolving it cheaply.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'beautiful belle and repulsive hag' line borders on a clichéd binary.",
      "The description of the 'new day' where 'no cloud will touch the sky' flirts with sentimental imagery, though it is grounded in Revelation 21."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission of the preacher's own uncertainty regarding Pops Swinton.",
      "The description of 'conscience hauling out the deeds of the day' in the dark of night."

    "recommendation": "Maintain the 'tragic' element of the Swinton story; it is the sermon's strongest defense against kitsch. Avoid the 'belle/hag' type of clichéd binaries."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon creates a 'Space for Grace' by paradoxically highlighting the 'Space for Judgment.' Cilliers argues that true aesthetics opens space for grace by breaking through fixed frames. This sermon breaks the 'fixed frame' of 'vague universalism' to show that grace is a 'terrible' and 'urgent' gift that can be refused. By sustaining the tension between 'everlasting mercy' and 'consequence,' the preacher respects the mystery of the human will and the divine actor. The 'space' is not closed by moralism ('you must do X, Y, Z'), but by an invitation to 'hear'—an aesthetic and spiritual act. However, the 'moralization' of the 'rap singers' and 'habits' slightly narrows the space for the 'unavailable' work of the Spirit.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between the two thieves and the two outcomes of judgment is maintained until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, particularly in the 'Pops Swinton' narrative where the preacher refuses to play God.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails as the 'offering' that is being refused, though the appeal has strong moralizing undertones.",
    "recommendation": "To create more space, the preacher could explore the 'Book of Life' not just as a record of works, but as a 'Space of Grace' where names are written by the 'Savior's Final Name'."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a powerful example of the 'Aesthetic Turn' in a traditional homiletical framework. It rejects the 'dry' proclamation of the early 20th century in favor of a sensory, narrative, and rhythmic 'performance' of the Word. Its primary strength lies in its 'Poetics of Language'—specifically its musicality and imagery. The preacher successfully 'reframes' the terrifying concept of the Last Judgment into a present, psychological urgency. By using 'open' narratives like the story of Pops Swinton, the sermon avoids the 'kitsch' of easy answers and instead creates a space of 'holy fear' and 'urgent grace.' While it occasionally relies on dated binaries and revivalist tropes, the overall aesthetic effect is one of 'sober beauty' and 'dramaturgical power.' It is a sermon that 'happens' (Immink) in the ears and souls of the listeners.",

    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Kitsch) and Gerrit Immink (Performance/Event).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to hearers who value emotional resonance, storytelling, and the 'sound' of the Word—particularly those in traditions that value the 'prophetic' and 'poetic' voice.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'visual' metaphors for the 'Book of Life' to balance the 'books of works'.",
      "Read the text aloud to identify where the 'rhythm' might be 'over-powering' the 'content'.",
      "Incorporate a moment of 'silence' or 'stasis' in the structure to contrast with the high-energy rhythmic build-up."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust 'event' that honors the gravity of its subject matter through masterful language and narrative structure. It avoids the pitfalls of 'religious kitsch' by daring to dwell in the tragic and the unresolved. While its 'closed' revivalist ending is a product of its homiletical tradition, the 'open' narratives within the body of the sermon provide the necessary polyvalence for a modern 'aesthetic' assessment. It is a 7.5—a strong, effective, and at times exceptional piece of homiletical art."
