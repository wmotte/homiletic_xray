    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of 'Prophetic Shaming.' While theologically sophisticated and socially conscious, it operates primarily through a Critical Parent ego state that seeks to induce a 'Guilty Adapted Child' response in the listener. By equating modern systemic issues directly with the physical torture of Christ, it creates a psychological 'no-win' situation for the listener, leading to a payoff of existential guilt rather than autonomous liberation.",
