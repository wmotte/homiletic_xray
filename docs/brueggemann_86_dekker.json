We can line out the move from death to life physically, historically, literally, metaphorically, symbolically ... any way you want.

    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's primary formal requirement. Instead of expounding one specific passage, it treats the Bible as a collection of 'keywords' (life out of death) and 'ideas' (newness). It jumps from Genesis to Exodus, Jeremiah, Psalm 119, and the Gospels, resulting in a thematic speech rather than a sermon.",
      "quotes": [
        "Everywhere we look in our memory of faith, we see this God who does these wonders...",

      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one pericope (e.g., Jeremiah 31:31-34) and identify what is unique to that text that cannot be found in Genesis or the Gospels. Stop using the Bible as a source of illustrations for a pre-conceived theme."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is a basic awareness of the Babylonian exile and the Hebrew alphabet (Psalm 119), but it remains superficial. The preacher uses historical context as a backdrop for a general 'imperial system' trope rather than rigorous linguistic or theological exegesis of the specific text.",
      "quotes": [
        "God speaks to the Israelites who ended up in the Babylonian imperial system...",
        "In our reading today, all eight verses in Hebrew begin with the letter Beth, 'B'."

      "improvement_point": "Move beyond general historical summaries. Analyze the specific Hebrew/Greek terms in the chosen passage to uncover the 'new, current, proclamatory word' Dekker demands."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is largely sociopolitical and remains somewhat general. While it mentions 'widows, orphans, immigrants,' it falls into the 'general truths' Dekker forbids. It lacks the 'psychological help' and personal concreteness required for the spiritual life of the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "It turns out that the new life in God’s fidelity is a life for the neighborhood...",
        "we must die to many old assumptions about wealth and power and control..."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured in blocks (I, II, III, IV), which separates the biblical 'memory' from the 'now.' Exposition and application are treated as sequential steps rather than a mixed movement where the hearer is 'expounded' by the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "I. But in truth, the God of the gospel has been doing this forever...",
        "IV. When Jesus teaches his disciples..."

      "improvement_point": "Abolish the numbered sections. Weave the contemporary situation directly into the explanation of the biblical text so the 'present of revelation' can occur."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The categories are present but 'soft.' Misery is framed as 'chaos' or 'imperial systems' rather than the radical misery of man before God. Redemption is present as 'newness,' and gratitude as 'new obedience,' but they feel like general concepts rather than a Trinitarian movement.",
      "quotes": [
        "God can probe into our deepest negations and create new possibility...",
        "The new covenant is new life out of the death of despair."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on 'dying to old assumptions,' but it lacks the gravity of the 'two ways.' There is no real sense of being 'lost' in the eternal or temporal sense, only a 'failed' reality versus a 'new' one.",
      "quotes": [
        "Give up what is old and deathly and greedy and anxious and hopeless. Give it up.",
        "It is to this move that the God of the gospel invites us..."

      "improvement_point": "The preacher must realize the possibility of being lost. Use the 'narrow way' and 'broad way' imagery to show that human choices have ultimate consequences."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the 'seal of the deal' and the goal of the grain of wheat. However, Christ often functions as an example of a general principle ('life out of death') rather than the unique, ontological Lord (God) who is the telos.",
      "quotes": [
        "In the Christian tradition, the seal of the deal is Easter.",
        "this newness is what God has been doing for a long time... in Christ."

      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "At approximately 1,150 words, the sermon would last roughly 11-12 minutes. This is significantly below Dekker's 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for 'depth.'",
      "improvement_point": "The sermon needs to be nearly doubled in length. Use that space not for more examples, but for deeper exposition of one text and more concrete application."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text falls short of Dekker's definition of a sermon primarily because it is a thematic speech rather than an exposition of a specific Bible passage. It is far too short to achieve the necessary depth. It treats the Bible as a repository of general truths about 'newness' rather than a specific, current Word of God. The application is sociopolitically focused but lacks personal, psychological, and dogmatic sharpness.",
    "strengths": [
      "Clear thematic focus on 'life out of death'.",
      "Adequate awareness of the historical context of the Babylonian exile.",
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' (misery, redemption, gratitude) as a background structure."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Failure to stick to one specific pericope (Thesis 1).",
      "Insufficient length for theological and hermeneutical depth (Thesis 8).",
      "Application is too general and lacks the 'seriousness' of the two ways (Thesis 6).",
      "Separation of exposition and application into distinct blocks (Thesis 4)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition; it is a thematic address. It lacks the specificity of the Word and the necessary breadth to provide true depth. It functions as a 'bicycle mechanic who does not properly mount the wheel.'"
