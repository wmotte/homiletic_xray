    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively evokes concrete experience through historical and communal memory. It moves from the abstract 'power not our own' to the sensory 'slave quarters' and 'humming softly in the twilight.' The hearer is invited to feel the weight of 'trouble' and the 'wail' of a cry. However, the experience is largely collective and historical rather than immediate or individual, which may slightly distance contemporary hearers not sharing that specific heritage.",

        "Far back in the slave quarters our fathers and mothers hummed softly in the twilight",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Reflection is present but brief. The sermon pauses to consider the 'why' of the struggle, framing it as a participation in the life of Christ. It observes the social condition of the 'not many mighty' and the 'conscience of the world.' However, it lacks a deep analytical pause or an exploration of the 'problem' from multiple perspectives; it moves quickly toward theological resolution.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Theological depth is the sermon's strongest suit despite its brevity. It formulates a clear 'big idea': the universality of Christ's sacrifice and the necessity of the 'Calvary way' for righteousness. It utilizes solid exegesis of the nature of the Atonement, moving from the specific (Montgomery) to the universal (the world). The logic is deductive: because Christ died for all, our struggle must be for all.",

The 'how' of responding to the 'cry' is implied but not explicitly mapped out.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_kolb_score": 6.2,
    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of visionary and declarative preaching that grounds a specific social struggle in universal theological truths. It begins with a strong concrete experience, drawing on communal memory and sensory imagery to establish a connection with the hearer. It then moves into a sophisticated abstract conceptualization, arguing that the 'way of Calvary' is the only path to 'moral sanity' and that this path must be universal, not particular. However, the sermon falls short in the pragmatic and active experimentation phases. It identifies a 'cry' and a 'trouble' but offers a theological orientation rather than a practical response. The 'how' of the struggle is left to the imagination of the hearer. While the rhetoric is soaring and the theological foundation is solid, the lack of concrete application steps limits its effectiveness as a complete learning cycle for all hearer types, particularly those who learn through doing (Converging/Accommodating).",

      "Strengthen the Pragmatic quadrant by including 2-3 specific ways the congregation can practice 'universal love' this week.",

      "Ensure the 'Active Experimentation' phase is as robust as the 'Abstract Conceptualization' phase to complete the cycle."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong example of the Visionary-Declarative style, excelling in creating emotional resonance and theological depth. From a Kolb perspective, it successfully engages the 'Heart' and 'Head' but leaves the 'Hands' under-equipped. It is highly effective for Diverging and Assimilating learners who seek inspiration and intellectual frameworks. However, to reach a state of homiletical excellence and holistic learning, it requires a more developed Pragmatic dimension. The priority for improvement is the translation of 'The Calvary Way' into specific, actionable steps that the congregation can implement in their social and personal lives."
