      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's first requirement of focusing on one specific pericope. It is a thematic survey of the Gospel of John. By jumping between chapters 1, 8, 12, 17, 19, and 20, it treats the Bible as a source of keywords rather than a specific, current word of God. It lacks the 'point that can be found nowhere else' because it generalizes the entire Johannine witness.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let us now reflect tonight on a few crucial passages from John's Gospel.",
        "The first one is at the very beginning...",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is some attention to the original language (tetelestai) and the historical context of the term 'the Jews'. However, the exegesis is often subordinated to liturgical tradition (the use of Psalms on Good Friday) rather than a rigorous historical-critical or linguistic analysis of the text's original meaning for its first readers.",
      "quotes": [
        "John sometimes seems to use the term 'the Jews' to mean, more or less, 'the religious authorities'...",
        "It is finished (tetelestai)... A better translation would be 'It is accomplished.'"

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application remains largely general. While it mentions 'self-betterment' and 'personality flaws', it lacks the concrete, sharp analysis of the zeitgeist Dekker demands. It touches on the Holocaust but uses it as a pivot to a general theological point rather than a concrete application to the current world.",
      "quotes": [

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon avoids the 'block' structure of 15 minutes of exegesis followed by 5 minutes of application. It attempts to weave the meaning of the text into the experience of the hearer, particularly through the use of the first-person plural ('we', 'us').",
      "quotes": [
        "This is the key insight. It was not 'the Jews.' It was us.",
        "He who has been without sin all his life is about to enter its prison-house. He and he alone has its key."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon strongly emphasizes misery (bondage to sin, the prison house) and redemption (Christ as the Lamb). It correctly identifies misery as 'misery before God'. Gratitude is less prominent but implied in the call to 'abide in his love'.",
      "quotes": [
        "We cannot take away our own sin because we are slaves to it...",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon acknowledges the 'Prince of Darkness' and the 'domain of Death', which hints at the two ways. However, the 'seriousness of being lost' is somewhat softened by a focus on the victory of Christ, making the choice for the hearer feel less urgent or ultimate.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now shall the ruler of this world be cast out...",
        "Believe tonight. Take him into your heart..."

      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "This is the sermon's strongest point. Christ is clearly the telos. The doctrine of the two natures is present in the discussion of Christ's power and his submission. Grace is central to the deliverance described.",
      "quotes": [
        "The power given to Christ as the Son of God is greater than the power of Sin and Death.",
        "Even as death engulfs him, our Lord Jesus is his Father's victorious Son."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 16.5 minutes (1650 words), the sermon fails Dekker's 20-minute minimum requirement. It lacks the 'breadth' required for true 'depth', opting for a broad survey rather than a deep drilling into a single text.",
      "improvement_point": "Increase the length by slowing down and providing more 'breadth' in the exposition of a single passage."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily due to its lack of a specific biblical pericope and its insufficient length. It functions more as a thematic theological lecture on the Gospel of John and the Good Friday liturgy than as a sermon that 'recreates a Bible passage into a new, current, proclamatory word.' While the Christocentric focus is strong and the categories of misery and redemption are present, the lack of specificity prevents it from saying something that can be found 'nowhere else.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christocentric focus with Christ as the clear telos.",
      "Effective use of the 'misery' category, avoiding psychological reductionism.",
      "Good integration of the 'two natures' doctrine in the Passion narrative."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Fails the formal requirement of focusing on one specific Bible passage.",
      "Duration is below the 20-minute threshold required for depth.",
      "Application is too general and lacks concrete contemporary analysis."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "According to Dekker’s definition, this is not a sermon but a thematic speech about 'the Gospel' or 'the Passion'. It lacks the formal specificity and the required length to achieve the depth Dekker demands of the ministry."
