    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in 'showing' rather than just 'telling.' The preacher uses the motif of 'clothes' as a powerful sensory and symbolic thread. The description of the scourging is visceral, utilizing tactile and visual details that evoke the 'stench' of the barracks and the physical trauma of the lash. By connecting the biblical mockery to the historical caricature of Black people in minstrel shows, the preacher creates a bridge of 'painful imagery' that is both culturally specific and universally human. This is a prime example of Wilson’s cinematic quality; the hearer sees the 'faded red tunic' and the 'chunks of flesh.' The imagery is not merely decorative; it is the vehicle for the theological weight of the Passion.",
      "quotes": [
        "The instrument of torture was a long leather strip, studded with pieces of lead and bits of bone.",
        "Physical features were caricatured and exaggerated, and so the large white-lipped, wide-eyed, blackened faces in minstrel shows...",
        "They jammed a reed in his hand to mock a scepter, plaited a crown made out of thorn bush for his brow, and flung around the Lord's shoulder an old, faded red tunic."

        "The transition to the 'Doberman pinscher' anecdote, while humorous, slightly disrupts the high-seriousness of the Passion imagery.",

        "The final vision of glory could benefit from more specific sensory details beyond 'outshining the sun'."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is dignified and precise, reflecting McEntyre’s 'stewardship of language.' The preacher avoids modern 'Canaanite' jargon, instead using a 'Sober-Reformed' yet rhythmic vocabulary. There is a clear effort to define the gravity of words like 'mockery' and 'dignity.' The precision is most evident when discussing the Roman ritual of execution, citing Cicero and Barclay to ground the sermon in historical reality. However, the section on 'godlessness' in America occasionally leans into broader generalizations that lack the surgical precision of the earlier sections on Christ's suffering.",
      "quotes": [
        "There is something uniquely cruel in being laughed at and mocked, set apart from one's fellows and made the target of ugly jibes.",
        "The Roman ritual of condemnation and execution was fixed.",
        "Godlessness is what is wrong with America. How does it come out? In the swagger of a gun lobby and money..."

        "Clear, accessible language that avoids theological obscuration.",
        "Effective use of historical and literary citations (Cicero, George Eliot) to add weight.",
        "Nuanced distinction between 'sentiment' and 'emotion' in the context of mockery."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The term 'godlessness' is repeated frequently without a precise theological definition, bordering on a catch-all phrase.",
        "The anecdote about the dog, while rhetorically effective for a specific audience, lacks the linguistic elevation of the rest of the text.",
        "Some sentences in the middle section are slightly repetitive in their structure."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Very low jargon. Theological concepts like 'Redeemer' and 'Sacrifice' are contextualized within the narrative of the 'clothes'."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits the rhythmic 'cadence' typical of the great African American preaching tradition. There is a masterful use of parallelism and repetition ('Never mind the...', 'It is all right now'). The sentence lengths vary effectively: short, staccato sentences for the actions of the soldiers, and longer, flowing periods for the theological reflections. The use of Isaiah 63 provides a rhythmic, liturgical climax. It is clearly 'oral language' designed for the ear, possessing a natural 'flow' that builds toward the 'shout' of the conclusion. The rhythm supports the 'event' of the sermon as described by Immink.",
      "quotes": [
        "Never mind the churches and synagogues and mosques; godlessness is what is wrong with us.",
        "It is all right now. The crooked way has been made straight; we may arise and shine for light is come. It is all right now.",
        "No longer with an old, faded red cloak... no longer mocked by soldiers, no longer wearing simple garments."

      "strengths": [
        "Excellent use of anaphora (repetition at the start of sentences) to build rhetorical momentum.",
        "A natural 'swing' or cadence that makes the text feel like a performance.",
        "Effective 'staccato' pacing during the description of the scourging."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition into the political critique (gun lobbies) loses some of the rhythmic elegance of the biblical exposition.",
        "The quote from George Eliot feels slightly 'tacked on' and breaks the rhythmic flow.",
        "The concluding paragraph is a bit dense with 'ten thousand times ten thousand' tropes."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Pure oral language. This text is meant to be heard, not just read."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by a 'sober beauty' and visceral imagery. The preacher avoids abstract theological 'telling' by grounding the Passion in the concrete reality of 'clothes' and the historical trauma of mockery. The language is rhythmic and musical, clearly designed for oral delivery, with a strong sense of 'stewardship' over every word. While it occasionally dips into broader social generalizations, the micro-aesthetics remain high due to the fresh application of the 'clothes' metaphor and the vivid, almost cinematic, reconstruction of the biblical scene."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with the 'upsetting' of human dignity through mockery, moves through the 'deepening' of the problem (the barracks, the scourging), and reaches a turning point when the 'fake garments' are removed to reveal Christ 'in his own clothes.' The movement from the 'faded red tunic' to the 'raiment that outshines the sun' provides a satisfying macro-arc. However, the middle section on American 'godlessness' feels like a lengthy 'detour' that threatens to stall the narrative momentum before returning to the Calvary scene.",
      "quotes": [
        "Each new assault seemed designed to outdo the last.",
        "And then we read that when the soldiers had tired of their ugly game... they took off the old scarlet tunic and put his own clothes back on him.",
        "We shall see him yet in other clothes."

        "Clear progression from humiliation to revelation to glorification.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest structural strength. Cilliers' concept of 'reframing' is perfectly executed here. The preacher reframes the Roman soldiers' mockery through the lens of American minstrelsy and contemporary 'sham religion.' The biblical text is not a 'springboard' but a mirror. By connecting the 'faded red tunic' to modern 'patronizing words of respect,' the preacher forces the hearer to see their own 'godlessness' within the Roman barracks. The synthesis of 'then' and 'now' feels organic because it is rooted in the universal human experience of dignity and ridicule.",
      "quotes": [
        "One of the most painful and sinister weapons used historically against black people in this country was mockery and ridicule.",
        "There are still many who put cloaks of imitation honor and false respect on the Lord Jesus as surely as those soldiers put their old scarlet robe on the Savior.",
        "In the swagger of a gun lobby and money that stops congressmen... Godlessness is what is wrong with America."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of the Passion through the history of racial mockery.",
        "The application (the 'dog' anecdote, the 'gun lobby') is concrete and confrontational.",
        "The 'strangeness' of the Roman barracks is made uncomfortably familiar."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'gun lobby' example might feel dated or overly specific to certain hearers, potentially closing the space for some.",
        "The connection between the Northwestern student and Christ 'doing his best' is a bit of a 'moralistic' stretch.",
        "The transition to Ellen White's vision feels slightly disconnected from the previous social critique."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes. It reframes 'respectable' modern religion as a form of Roman mockery."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is polyvalent in its imagery, it leans toward a 'closed' structure in its moral and social applications. The preacher uses strong, declarative language ('One word is the answer: godlessness') that leaves little room for ambivalence. However, the central image of Christ 'in his own clothes' remains an 'open work of art' (Stark), inviting the hearer to contemplate who Christ is beyond their own projections. The ending is a 'shout' of praise, which is liturgically appropriate but rhetorically 'seals' the interpretation of victory.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now, what is your reason? [referring to the dog anecdote]",
        "Looking at Jesus as he is, we see ourselves as we are.",
        "Shall we not shout his name who has lifted us to heights sublime...?"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The central metaphor of 'clothes' allows for multiple layers of interpretation (identity, sham, truth).",
        "The preacher treats the hearer as a 'mature conversation partner' by challenging their 'chic and fashionable' dismissals.",
        "Acknowledges the 'inner agony' and 'terrifying' road, respecting the difficulty of faith."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'dog' anecdote is quite 'closed' and arguably manipulative/shaming.",
        "The social critique section offers 'one word' answers, which can feel reductive.",
        "More room could be left for the 'mystery' of why Christ allows the mockery."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly closed/monovalent in its moral application, but open/polyvalent in its central metaphor."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is a powerful movement from the 'barracks' of human shame to the 'throne' of divine glory. The integration of text and context is masterful, using 'reframing' to make the Passion narrative hit home in a contemporary American setting. While the narrative arc is occasionally slowed by social commentary and the tone can become somewhat 'closed' or moralistic, the overall structure succeeds in taking the hearer on a transformative journey from self-confrontation to liturgical praise."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids religious kitsch. It does not offer 'immediate comfort' or 'cheap grace.' By dwelling on the 'chunks of flesh' and the 'sinister weapon' of mockery, the preacher takes the pain of the Passion and the pain of history seriously. The 'happy ending' is not a cliché but a hard-won eschatological hope. The only minor 'kitsch' risk is the 'Northwestern student' story, which borders on the 'heroic-sentimental,' but it is anchored by the sobering question 'Did I do my best?' which turns the sentiment back into a self-examination.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'dog' anecdote, while rhetorically effective, borders on a 'pre-chewed' pulpit cliché.",
      "The 'chic and fashionable' dismissal of the church is a slightly stereotypical 'villain' trope."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The connection to the 'minstrel shows' and the personal admission ('I am not far enough from the experience...').",
      "The description of the 'barracks humor' as 'chilling the spirit'—an authentic emotional response to the holy."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the visceral historical connections; they provide the 'grit' that prevents the sermon from sliding into the 'stained-glass' kitsch of traditional Passion piety."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace through the 'reframing' of Christ's identity. By stripping away the 'fake garments' of human respectability, the preacher creates a 'space' where the 'Holy happens' (Immink). The tension between Christ's 'inner agony' and his 'glorious apparel' is sustained. However, the 'moralization' in the middle section (the 'we must' and the critique of godlessness) temporarily 'closes' the space by shifting the focus from God's action to human failure. The conclusion successfully re-opens the space by focusing on the 'once for all' work of Calvary.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'village idiot' mockery and the 'Son of God' is powerfully sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the 'winepress' and the 'dyed garments' is honored through the use of prophetic imagery.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the beginning and end; moralization dominates the middle.",
    "recommendation": "Soften the 'dog' anecdote and the 'one word answer' approach to allow the grace of the 'own clothes' metaphor to do the work of conviction more subtly."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the 'Aesthetic Turn' in practice, specifically within the African American homiletic tradition. It rejects the 'vertical revelation' of Thurneysen in favor of a deeply 'human' and 'sensory' exploration of the Passion. The preacher uses the 'Poetics of Language' to create a cinematic experience of the barracks, making the 'how' of the mockery inseparable from the 'what' of the atonement. The 'Dramaturgy' is effective, moving from the 'upsetting' of dignity to the 'reframing' of Christ as the one who wears 'his own clothes'—a symbol of ultimate authenticity and divine authority. While it occasionally flirts with moralism and rhetorical tropes that 'close' the work of art, it ultimately opens a 'Space for Grace' by refusing to look away from the 'stench' and 'ridicule' of the cross. It is a 'sober-beautiful' performance that honors the 'stewardship of language' while achieving a high degree of 'religious involvement.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the Passion through the lens of historical racial mockery.",
      "Rhythmic and musical language that creates a palpable 'event' for the hearer.",
      "Visceral, sensory imagery that avoids religious kitsch and sanitization."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Better integration of the social/political critique into the narrative arc.",
      "Reduction of 'closed' moralistic anecdotes (the dog story).",
      "More precise theological definition of 'godlessness' to avoid platitudes."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Dramatic with high Pathos",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Four Pages).",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who value emotional depth, social justice, and traditional rhythmic preaching; it appeals to those who need the 'Word' to be made 'flesh' through concrete human experience.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer in the 'mystery' of the winepress.",
      "Use more 'stewardship' in the social critique to match the precision of the biblical imagery.",
      "Read the text aloud to ensure the 'dog' anecdote doesn't jar the musicality of the Passion narrative."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically strong 'performance of the holy.' It succeeds because it does not merely 'tell' the story of the cross; it 'shows' the cost of human mockery and the beauty of divine authenticity. By using 'clothes' as a central aesthetic motif, the preacher bridges the gap between the ancient text and the contemporary context. It is a sermon that 'reframes' reality, forcing the hearer to look at Christ—and themselves—without the 'fake garments' of religious pretense. Despite minor structural detours, it remains a model of how 'form is content' in the service of the Gospel."
