    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Bait and Switch' homiletics. While theologically sophisticated, it functions by intentionally destabilizing the listener's sense of security (Child) through the Critical Parent's 'holy fear,' only to offer a Rescuer-based solution. This creates a cycle of dependency where the 'Good News' is only accessible after the preacher has successfully induced 'dread.'",

      "Attempts to address the 'simul' (sinner/saint) tension."

      "Heavy reliance on inducing 'holy fear' to validate the message.",
      "The congregation is consistently infantilized as 'young and fresh' or 'wretched defendants'."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try an Adult-Adult approach: instead of 'making' the congregation feel dread, invite them to objectively examine the reality of consequences and personal responsibility in the 'here-and-now' without the 'men in black robes' imagery."
