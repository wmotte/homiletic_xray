    "sermon_start_end": "The Canadian theologian Douglas Harink, whose commentary on I Peter I commend to you, writes these words that are almost like a prayer for the preaching and the hearing of a sermon [...] And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, establish, and strengthen you. To him be the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.",
    "notes": "The sermon employs a high-theological register while utilizing narrative illustrations to bridge the gap between New Testament cosmology and modern experience."

  "kolb_phases_analysis": {
    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon attempts to ground the abstract concept of 'the devil' in concrete experience through two primary narratives: the Loch Ness anecdote and Roméo Dallaire's account of Rwanda. While the Dallaire quote is visceral, the sermon lacks a 'slice of life' connection to the immediate, everyday world of the Ontario congregation. The experience remains somewhat distant—either in the realm of extreme global tragedy or humorous folklore—rather than the 'feeling' level of the hearer's current reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have seen him, I have smelled him, and I have touched him. I know the devil exists.",
        "The trembling professor responded, 'Aye, Lorrrrd God, but until a minute ago I didn’t believe in the Loch Ness monster, either!'"

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher excels at pausing to explore the 'why' and the cultural condition. There is a clear analysis of the 'problem'—the loss of the demonic category in modern thought and the 'generic, bland spirituality' of the West. It forces the hearer to look at their own cultural context (post-Christianity, American idolatry) from a different perspective, though it stops short of a deep psychological exploration of the individual's condition.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have been fooled by a veneer of generic, bland 'spirituality' that has no devouring enemies.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the strongest phase of the sermon. The preacher provides a robust theological framework, drawing on Harink, Hauerwas, Barth, and Lewis. The exegesis of 1 Peter is logically connected to the 'Big Idea': the church is a community of resistance constituted by God's prior choice. The logic is deductive and the dogmatic deepening regarding the 'glory of God' and 'triune worship' is clear and authoritative.",
      "quotes": [
        "The church resists, endures, and conquers not through its own efforts... but because of the call, the commission, and the continuing presence of God.",

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon falters in providing concrete, actionable steps. While it identifies 'true worship' and 'resistance' as responses, these remain largely conceptual. The preacher explicitly admits to not knowing what the congregation's specific 'warfare' is, which leaves the application in the realm of generalities. The call to 'discern' is a task, but not a specific action step.",
      "quotes": [
        "Your calling is to discern the place of resistance that the Lord has set before you.",
        "The foremost way of resistance is, of course, the worship of the Christian community."

It falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase of Kolb's cycle, leaving the congregation with a clear 'what' and 'why' but a vague 'how'. The preacher relies heavily on the 'Declarative' structure, which serves the 'Assimilating' learner well but may leave the 'Converging' learner searching for practical relevance. The use of narrative is effective for engagement but functions more as a series of illustrations than a structural driver. The sermon's greatest strength is its refusal to simplify the 'glory of God' or the 'reality of evil', providing a high-level theological framework that challenges the 'bland spirituality' of the current age. However, the lack of specific, local application prevents it from completing a truly transformative learning cycle.",

      "Use the 'Narrative' structure to carry the theological weight rather than just illustrating it."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong example of 'Declarative' preaching that prioritizes theological accuracy and cultural interpretation. From a Kolb perspective, it is intellectually satisfying and provides a clear 'Normative' task (Osmer). However, its failure to provide concrete 'Active Experimentation' steps limits its effectiveness as a tool for holistic adult learning. It informs the mind and inspires the imagination but stops at the threshold of the 'hands'. For a congregation to truly 'resist', they need more than a cosmology; they need a practice. The priority for improvement is the development of specific, actionable applications that bridge the gap between the 'God's-eye view' and the 'Ontario-pew view'."
