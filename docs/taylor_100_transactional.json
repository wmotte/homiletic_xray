    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and health-promoting. It utilizes the Adult ego state to deconstruct the mechanics of dehumanization, thereby stripping the 'Persecutor' of their power and the 'Victim' of their shame. By addressing the 'Oppressor' as someone who is also 'maimed' and in need of 'salvation,' the preacher avoids the trap of binary moralizing (NIGYSOB) and instead promotes a universal humanism. The appeal to the 'Free Child' through the imagery of the 'sorrow songs' provides an emotional anchor for the Adult's logical conclusions.",

      "High Adult presence promotes critical thinking.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The language of 'diseased minds' could potentially trigger a Critical Parent response in listeners who identify with the described group, closing off their Adult processing."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to frame systemic critique through the lens of 'rehumanization' for all parties. This keeps the transaction Adult-Adult and prevents the listener from retreating into an Adapted Child (defensive) or Persecutor (angry) role."
