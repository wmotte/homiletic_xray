    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery effectively by grounding abstract theological concepts (Resurrection, Grace) in concrete biblical and contemporary scenes. The preacher employs the 'Sea of Galilee fire' as a recurring sensory anchor, connecting Peter’s past failure with his restoration. The use of Joni Eareckson Tada’s physical description provides a vivid, almost visceral counterpoint to 'symbolic' hope. However, the imagery is often used as an illustrative tool rather than a primary mode of 'showing.' The sermon leans toward 'telling' the meaning of the image rather than letting the image speak for itself, which is a common trait in teaching-oriented sermons. The metaphor of the 'receipt' for the resurrection is a strong, albeit more conceptual, image that aids clarity.",
      "quotes": [
        "I, with shriveled, bent fingers, atrophied muscles, gnarled knees, and no feeling from the shoulders down...",
        "Jesus has made a fire, and he is cooking fish so they can sit down and eat.",

      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "The sermon leans toward 'telling.' While it 'shows' through the story of Peter and Joni Eareckson Tada, it quickly moves to systematic explanation (the four principles)."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and demonstrates high 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre). The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by defining terms like 'transitive verb' and 'homo incurvatus in se' in ways that illuminate rather than obscure. There is a clear effort to do justice to the nuance of human experience, particularly in the psychological analysis of Peter’s failure and the 'disordered loves' of the hearer. The word choice is economical; every sentence serves the progression of the argument. The distinction between 'sentiment' and 'life-transforming power' is handled with intellectual rigor, avoiding the vagueness often found in contemporary preaching.",
      "quotes": [
        "The word for curse here is a transitive verb which means it doesn’t just say he cursed, but it means he cursed someone or something.",

      "jargon_analysis": "Theological jargon is present but always 'translated' for a modern audience, making it a tool for clarity rather than a barrier."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a conversational, oral rhythm but lacks a high degree of poetic musicality. It is clearly 'oral language' rather than 'paper language,' characterized by short sentences, rhetorical questions, and direct address. There is a staccato rhythm in the sections of self-examination ('Me, me, me, me!'), which effectively mirrors the internal state of the 'curved-in' self. However, the overall structure is more didactic than lyrical. It lacks the 'legato' passages of reflection that Cilliers or Grözinger might look for in a more 'aesthetic' sermon. It sounds like a lecture-sermon: clear and engaging, but not necessarily 'beautiful' in its sound value.",
      "quotes": [
        "The deepest part of your heart just says, 'Me, me, me, me! What’s good for me?'",

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Distinctly oral language. It is designed for the ear, though it follows a very logical, almost written-out outline."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' and intellectual precision. It excels in 'stewardship of the word' by translating ancient concepts into contemporary psychological and existential categories. While it lacks high poetic musicality, its strength lies in its clarity and the vividness of its illustrative imagery. It avoids religious kitsch through rigorous definitions and a refusal to use empty clichés. The imagery serves the 'reframing' of the hearer's reality, moving from abstract hope to concrete, 'new spinal cord' restoration."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry), beginning with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium'—the failure of Peter. The tension is well-maintained as the preacher explores the depth of Peter’s betrayal, making it palpable for the hearer. The 'turning point' is the encounter at the fire, where the gospel reframes the failure. However, the four-point structure (Believe, Understand, Submit, Live) acts as a somewhat rigid scaffold that interrupts the narrative flow. While the movement from 'problem' (failure/sin) to 'solution' (grace/restoration) is clear, the transition between the logical points feels more like a classroom progression than a dramatic journey.",
      "quotes": [
        "I don’t know of any story of a more spectacular failure than this, do you?",
        "He is experiencing a death, but... but... every time Peter says, 'Lord, I am a total moral failure,' Jesus says, 'Feed my lambs.'",
        "Nothing makes you more effective... than your failure plunged into a sea of my grace."

      "strengths": [
        "Strong opening that establishes high stakes (life transformation).",
        "Effective use of the 'Peter case study' to ground the entire sermon in a narrative.",

      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Soften the 'four principles' structure to allow the narrative arc to feel more organic.",
        "The conclusion is a bit abrupt; it moves quickly into a prayer without a final 'recapitulation' of the aesthetic movement.",
        "Increase the tension in the 'apologetic' section to make the 'belief' point feel more like a discovery than an instruction."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A hybrid of a dynamic narrative journey and a static four-point teaching structure."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength of the sermon. The 'reframing' (Cilliers) of Peter’s story into a contemporary psychological framework (disordered loves, shame/honor culture vs. individualistic culture) is masterfully done. The preacher respects the 'strangeness' of the biblical text (the shame of Peter’s betrayal) while making it intensely relevant to a modern person’s struggle with identity and failure. The integration of the 'fish-eating' Jesus with the hope of a 'new spinal cord' is a surprising and effective synthesis of the ancient text and modern physical suffering. It successfully offers a new frame: failure is not the end, but the prerequisite for grace-based leadership.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is a shame and honor culture... a shame that can never be remedied.",
        "No other religion, no other philosophy promises new bodies, hearts, and minds.",
        "You are going to be the main leader of my church not in spite of the fact you were the biggest failure but because you were the biggest failure."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent cultural analysis that bridges the gap between the 1st and 21st centuries.",
        "The 'reframing' of failure as a qualification for leadership is a profound aesthetic and theological move.",
        "Organic connection between the doctrine of substitution and the narrative of Peter."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition to the 'apologetic' section (evidence for the resurrection) feels slightly detached from the emotional core of Peter's story.",
        "More explicit connection to the specific 'fires' of the modern hearer would strengthen the 'context' side.",
        "The 'Princess Bride' comparison, while clear, is aesthetically 'lower' than the rest of the discourse."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes. It reframes failure from a 'dead end' to a 'space for grace' and leadership."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is relatively 'closed' (Stark). It functions as a 'teaching' work of art where the preacher provides the answers and the framework. While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (Peter’s weeping, Joni’s suffering), it quickly resolves these tensions through the lens of substitutionary atonement. The hearer is guided through a very specific interpretation. There is little room for 'polyvalence'; the meaning of the fire, the three questions, and the resurrection are all clearly defined. While this provides clarity and comfort, it leaves less room for the hearer to 'step into' the text and find their own path of appropriation.",
      "quotes": [
        "Here are the four principles we’ll learn here.",
        "Until you understand that’s how the resurrection functions... it will not change your life.",
        "You have some fires you need to go to with Jesus and let him sit down and heal you."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Provides a very secure and clear theological 'home' for the hearer.",
        "The invitation at the end ('let Jesus take you to your fires') is a gentle opening.",
        "Acknowledges the 'process' of belief, which respects the hearer's journey."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "End with a more open-ended question that invites the hearer to reflect on their own 'fire' without immediate resolution.",
        "Allow the 'mystery' of the resurrection to stand more on its own without over-explaining its 'achievement.'",
        "Reduce the 'must' and 'have to' language to create a more 'invitational' space."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A monovalent, teaching-oriented work. It is 'closed' in its theological conclusions but 'open' in its pastoral invitation."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is defined by a strong narrative-apologetic arc. It successfully 'reframes' the biblical narrative for a contemporary audience, making the 'strangeness' of the text accessible and urgent. While the structural 'four points' occasionally hinder the dramatic flow, the movement from the 'death' of failure to the 'resurrection' of grace is convincingly executed. It is a 'closed' work in terms of its theological clarity, but it creates an authentic space for the hearer to confront their own failures in the light of grace."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'cheap comfort' by dwelling extensively on the 'spectacular failure' and 'horrendous betrayal' of Peter. It does not offer a 'happy ending' without first passing through the 'death' of repentance. The use of Joni Eareckson Tada’s story is not sentimentalized; it focuses on 'atrophied muscles' and 'gnarled knees,' which is an authentic engagement with suffering. The preacher rejects the 'symbolic' resurrection as a mere 'feel-good factor' (like a movie), insisting on a reality that is 'life-transforming' precisely because it is hard-won. The emotion is authentic because it is rooted in the 'agony' of Peter's self-revelation.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'Princess Bride' reference is the closest the sermon comes to kitsch, as it uses a superficial 'feel-good' pop culture moment to contrast with the resurrection.",
      "None found."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of Peter's 'curses' as a transitive verb directed at Jesus—highlighting the depth of the betrayal.",
      "The refusal to smooth over the 'death' of Peter's self-sufficiency at the fire."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'anti-kitsch' stance by continuing to ground grace in the 'trouble' of the human condition (Wilson)."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened through the radical 'reframing' of failure. By showing that the 'number one leader' was the 'biggest failure,' the sermon dismantles moralistic 'closed' spaces where one must be 'strong' to be accepted. The 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) is found in the 'between'—between Peter's weeping and Jesus' cooking fish. However, the space is somewhat narrowed by the didactic 'four principles' which can feel like a new set of requirements (e.g., 'you have to believe... you have to understand'). The grace is structurally central, but the 'how-to' delivery slightly constrains the 'mystery' of the encounter.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between failure and restoration are sustained well through the narrative of the fire.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the resurrection is partially explained away by the 'receipt' analogy, though the 'physicality' of the fish-eating preserves some wonder.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails over moralization; the 'must' of the sermon is a 'must' of response to grace, not a 'must' of earning favor.",
    "recommendation": "To create more space, allow the 'silence' of the fire to speak more than the 'principles' of the preacher."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'Apologetic-Narrative' preaching. Its primary aesthetic power lies in its 'stewardship of language' and its ability to 'reframe' ancient texts for a modern, skeptical audience. The preacher avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by taking the reality of sin and physical suffering seriously. The 'micro-aesthetics' of the language are precise and intellectually stimulating, while the 'macro-aesthetics' of the structure provide a clear, albeit somewhat didactic, journey from failure to grace. The sermon excels at 'showing' the grace of God through the brokenness of Peter, making the 'holy happen' (Immink) in the moment of self-recognition for the hearer. While it is a 'closed' work of art that prioritizes teaching over polyvalence, its authenticity and lack of sentimentality give it significant aesthetic depth.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Intellectual precision and stewardship of language (McEntyre).",
      "Profound 'reframing' of failure as a qualification for grace (Cilliers).",
      "Authentic, anti-kitsch engagement with suffering and betrayal."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduce the 'bullet-point' didacticism to allow for a more organic narrative flow.",
      "Increase 'musicality' and poetic cadence in the more reflective passages.",
      "Allow more 'openness' and mystery in the conclusion to invite hearer appropriation."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Apologetic-Narrative",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'New Homiletic' (Wilson/Long) in its narrative focus, but with the 'Reframing' depth of Johan Cilliers and the 'Language Care' of McEntyre.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'urban-intellectual' hearers who value logical clarity, psychological depth, and an absence of religious sentimentality.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a 'Lowry Loop' structure that delays the 'four principles' until after the narrative tension has fully peaked.",
      "Use more sensory 'painting' of the biblical scene to increase the 'cinematic' quality (Wilson).",
      "Incorporate a moment of liturgical silence or an open-ended question to increase the 'Opera Aperta' (Stark) quality."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a highly effective aesthetic event that successfully bridges the gap between the 'vertical' Word and the 'horizontal' human condition. It avoids the 'kitsch' of easy answers while providing the 'sober beauty' of a grace that meets us in our deepest failures. Its strength is its clarity; its limitation is its didactic closure. Overall, it is a model of how to use language and structure to create a 'space for grace' in a secular age."
