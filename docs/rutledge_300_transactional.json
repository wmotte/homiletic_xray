    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and exceptionally healthy. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent ('you must be more like Mandela') and instead uses the Adult ego state to analyze history and the Free Child to celebrate liberation. By acknowledging the 'madness in men's hearts' and the reality that 'euphoria will not last,' the preacher maintains Adult credibility while offering genuine hope. It promotes autonomy by inviting listeners to 'discern' for themselves rather than merely obey.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult reality-testing regarding both politics and theology.",
      "High Free Child energy that promotes genuine joy rather than forced religious affect.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to ground theological claims in observable reality and personal struggle. The use of the 'struggling woman' anecdote is an excellent way to bridge the gap between grand narrative and individual experience without becoming a 'Rescuer'."
