    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates high competence in biblical-theological 'Sache'. The analysis of the shift from Galilee to Jerusalem is precise, utilizing socio-economic categories (peasant vs. money economy). The exegetical link between Isaiah 56 and Jeremiah 7 is the intellectual heart of the sermon. The 'blue' side is not merely data; it is a structural analysis of the 'citadel of injustice'. However, the theological 'Sache' in the Barthian sense—the living Christ as the Acting Subject—is somewhat overshadowed by the historical-political 'Sache'. Jesus is presented as a 'scriptural genius' and a 'country man', which risks reducing the ontological reality of the Incarnation to a brilliant social critique. The factual content is highly comprehensible but demands an intellectually active listener.",
      "quotes": [
        "moving from the peasant economy to the money economy that lives off cheap peasant labor.",
        "Who else would have thought to bring a text from Isaiah and a text from Jeremiah together in this way?",
        "The city was so big and so prosperous that it did not reckon with the neighborly requirements of God."

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher remains largely behind the text, which is diaconally appropriate, yet there is a distinct 'leakage' of an intellectual-prophetic persona. There is little vulnerability or personal 'fides qua' (the faith by which one believes). The self-revelation is that of a detached observer who values justice and historical accuracy. The 'I' only appears once ('We can imagine'), suggesting a preacher who prefers the role of the teacher-prophet over the fellow-sinner. The passion is intellectual and systemic rather than personal or pastoral. This creates a distance that, while avoiding 'hysterical' self-display, may feel 'schizoid' in its clinical analysis of Jesus' execution.",
      "quotes": [
        "We can imagine the dramatic music...",
        "In this text, he speaks only one verse. But what a verse!",
        "So now we know."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Schizoid. The preacher values structural correctness, historical order, and maintains a professional distance from the emotional weight of the 'weeping' mentioned in the text.",
      "diaconal_quality": "High. The preacher does not stand in the way of the text, but the 'I' is perhaps too absent to provide a bridge for the listener.",
      "strengths": [
        "Avoids narcissistic psychologization.",
        "Maintains focus on the prophetic message."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher to Students' or 'Prophet to Community'. The 'We-definition' is inclusive ('We are on the long walk', 'We also know'), but it is a solidarity of intellect and observation rather than a solidarity of shared brokenness. The tone is authoritative and slightly paternalistic in its 'So now we know' phrasing. There is a 'relationship noise' potential: the sharp critique of 'big-steeple priests' and 'influential men' might alienate listeners who identify with those roles, as the preacher offers little 'yellow' signal of pastoral care for the 'powerful' who are also under judgment.",
      "quotes": [

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily cognitive and observational. The 'Anspruch' (demand) is to 'see' the ideology and 'decide'. However, the 'Zuspruch' (promise/gift) is remarkably thin. The sermon focuses on why Jesus *had* to die (the logic of power) rather than what his death *does* for the sinner (the logic of Grace). In the Barthian sense, the 'Gospel' here is the 'unvarnished truth' and 'fresh imagination', which leans toward a psychological/political appeal rather than a theological promise of justification. The risk of moralism is present, not in 'do this', but in 'see this and be courageous'. The 'red' side is a call to awareness, but it lacks the 'rest' of the Gospel.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have to decide.",

    "dominant_side": "Blue (Factual/Analytical)",
    "disruptions": "The main disruption is the gap between the 'weeping' of Jesus (emotional/relational) and the 'analysis' of the preacher (intellectual). The preacher speaks about weeping without the tone reflecting it.",
    "healing_disruption": "Yes. The sermon disrupts the 'citadel of certitude' of the listener, forcing a confrontation with the 'predatory economy' of the church/temple."

    "the_factual_ear_hears": "Jesus was a brilliant social critic who combined Isaiah and Jeremiah to challenge the Jerusalem elite, leading to his inevitable political execution.",

    "the_appeal_ear_hears": "I must stop being blind to ideology. I must have 'fresh courage' and 'imagination' to act outside the box of the status quo.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6,
    "summary": "This is a robust, intellectually stimulating sermon that excels in 'blue' factual analysis and intertextual exegesis. It successfully bridges the gap between the 1st-century temple and contemporary systemic injustice. However, from a homiletical standpoint, it suffers from a lack of 'Zuspruch' (Gospel promise). The preacher acts as a brilliant analyst of the 'plot of Jesus' life', but the 'Acting Subject' (God) is largely replaced by 'ideology' and 'power arrangements'. The sermon lands as a call to awareness rather than a proclamation of salvation. While communicatively clear and congruent, it remains in the realm of 'Anspruch' (demand), leaving the listener with the burden of 'imagination' and 'decision' rather than the freedom of the Gospel. It is a 'Satisfactory' prophetic lecture, but lacks the 'Exceptional' balance of Law and Gospel.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a significant risk of psychologizing the 'revelation' into 'imagination'. The sermon treats the cross as a political consequence rather than a divine 'Yes' to humanity. God is the 'Lord of the temple' who 'cares about the economy', but He is not the primary actor in the sermon's climax; the 'spellbound people' and the 'urban leadership' are.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Masterful use of prophetic scripture (Isaiah/Jeremiah).",
      "Sharp, unsentimental socio-economic analysis.",
      "Clear, logical structure that builds tension."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Balance the political 'why' of the cross with the theological 'for us'.",
      "Increase the 'Zuspruch' to provide a foundation for the 'Anspruch'.",
      "Bridge the emotional gap between the 'weeping' text and the 'analytical' delivery."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A sharp, intellectually honest sermon that successfully disrupts complacency but fails to fully proclaim the liberating 'Gift' of the Gospel, leaving the listener in a state of unresolved 'decision'."
