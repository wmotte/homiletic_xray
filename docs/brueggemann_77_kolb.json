It relies on generalized descriptions of social categories (the rich, the winner, the 'successful person') rather than specific, lived-out stories.

    "overall_kolb_score": 6.2,
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of thematic-theological preaching that excels in re-framing biblical concepts for a contemporary audience. It is particularly effective in its 'Reflective Observation' and 'Abstract Conceptualization' phases, offering a compelling definition of 'righteousness' as 'integrated humanity.' However, it falls short of a complete Kolb cycle due to a lack of concrete, immersive experience at the start and specific, actionable experimentation at the end. The preacher functions primarily as an Advocate/Philosopher, successfully challenging the hearer's intellectual and cultural categories but providing few 'handles' for the Pragmatic or Accommodating learner. The tone is sober and the logic is tight, but the sermon remains somewhat detached from the 'doing' of the Christian life, favoring 'vision' over 'practice.'",

      "Start with a 'slice of life' story that illustrates the struggle of being 'truly human' in a specific situation.",
      "Include a 'Pragmatic' section: 'Here are three ways our church can practice this Isaiah 58 fast this week.'",
      "Use more 'Narrative' movement to show, rather than tell, what a 'righteous' person looks like."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a logically robust and theologically insightful piece that serves the 'Assimilating' learner well. It provides a necessary prophetic critique of societal norms and a high-level vision of the Christian life. However, from a Kolb perspective, it is 'top-heavy'—rich in reflection and conceptualization but thin on experience and application. To move from a 'good lecture' to a 'transformative sermon,' it requires a more intentional movement through the 'Active Experimentation' quadrant. The priority for improvement is the translation of high-level theological vision into the 'messy' specifics of congregational action."
