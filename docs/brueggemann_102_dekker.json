    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's primary requirement of focusing on ONE specific pericope. It treats three disparate texts (Psalm, Gospel, Epistle) as a thematic 'collage' to support a general idea of 'hope'. It does not find what is unique to Psalm 30, but uses it as a proof-text for a broader humanitarian optimism.",
      "quotes": [
        "The readings for today gave me the theme of hope.",
        "The readings for today give us three wondrous phrases...",
        "Here are three notions I received from these readings:"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one text (e.g., Psalm 30) and discard the others. Identify what Psalm 30 says about God that cannot be found in Luke or Galatians, specifically the movement from 'security' to 'dismay' to 'dancing'."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is largely absent. There is no engagement with Hebrew/Greek or the specific historical-theological context of the Davidic psalter or the Lucan mission. The 'exposition' is actually a thematic summary filtered through modern categories like 'health care policy' and 'privatization'.",
      "quotes": [
        "In this poetic idiom the Bible imagines that all that is old and weary...",
        "The Psalmist tells how he was doing so well, as stable and sure as a mountain."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Analyze the specific covenantal language of Psalm 30. Explain the 'Pit' (Sheol) in its ancient Near Eastern context rather than treating it as a general metaphor for a 'bad diagnosis'."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is contemporary but often slides into 'general truths' which Dekker forbids. It addresses the 'zeitgeist' (violence, greed, anxiety) but does so through a socio-political lens rather than a strictly proclamatory one.",
      "quotes": [
        "The followers of Jesus are a great force for good health care policy.",
        "We live in a society of privatization in which we want to extend well-being only to our kind."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move away from sociological categories like 'common good' and 'infrastructure' toward the concrete spiritual reality of the hearer's standing before God."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a '3x2' structure (three long-term goals, three short-term mandates). While it attempts to mix the two, it feels more like a lecture on 'notions' than a movement where the hearer is 'expounded' by the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "I want to think with you about the long game and the short run...",
        "A second short-term reality of our faith is..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Stop 'thinking with' the congregation about themes and start proclaiming the text's movement so that the application arises directly from the biblical imagery."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is present (the Boston bombing, the 'Pit'), but it is often externalized as social 'skirmishes'. Redemption is presented as a 'long game' outcome rather than a radical act of God in Christ. Gratitude is framed as 'doing what is right' (activism) rather than a response to grace.",
      "quotes": [
        "How long must we care for the poor? Well, until there are no more poor.",
        "What counts is the relatedness that arises from our embrace of the coming rule of God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the sense of 'misery' beyond social ills to the 'lostness' Dekker emphasizes. Ensure 'redemption' is not a human 'embrace' but God's sovereign act."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The sermon explicitly rejects the 'two ways' in its classical sense. It denies judgment and 'rapture' in favor of a universalist 'new creation' that 'overruns' the old. There is no sense of being 'lost' in eternity, only 'outflanked' by goodness.",
      "quotes": [
        "It will not end in a great fire or in a rapture of judgment.",
        "In the end all will be well. And if it is not well, it is not the end."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the seriousness of the 'Pit' in Psalm 30. Acknowledge that life is not a 'vacation' but a journey where being lost is a real possibility, as Dekker demands."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as a 'presence' and 'authority', but He is not the 'telos' (goal) of the sermon. The goal is 'well-being' and 'justice'. Christ is a means to a social-ethical end rather than the God-man who is our only life.",
      "quotes": [
        "The rule of God’s shalom is about to break in among us... It comes in his very person.",
        "The followers of Jesus are a great force for good health care policy."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make Christ the 'telos' by showing that salvation is 'outside ourselves' in Him, not in our 'healing juices' or 'missional work'."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 16.5 minutes, the sermon is too short according to Dekker's 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for 'depth', opting for a fast-paced thematic survey over deep textual drilling.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Increase the duration by slowing down to perform actual exegesis of the original languages and the specific theological weight of one text."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily by substituting a thematic lecture for the exposition of a specific Bible passage. It treats the Bible as a source of 'notions' and 'metaphors' for a pre-conceived theology of social hope. It explicitly rejects the 'two ways' (judgment/loss) and lacks a robust Christocentric telos, focusing instead on human agency and social progress.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete engagement with the zeitgeist (Boston bombing, privatization).",
      "Clear structure that is easy for the hearer to follow.",
      "Strong emphasis on the 'indicative' of the Kingdom before the 'imperative' of action."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of focus on a single pericope; uses three texts as thematic support.",
      "Rejection of the 'two ways' and the seriousness of eternal/temporal loss.",
      "Insufficient length (under 20 minutes) prevents exegetical depth.",
      "Christ is a model or enabler of 'well-being' rather than the ontological Savior."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is a religious speech about 'hope' and 'social justice' that uses biblical keywords, but fails to recreate a specific Bible passage into a new, current, proclamatory word."
