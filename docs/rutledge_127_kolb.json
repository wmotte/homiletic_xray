    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a strong concrete experience through a relatable anecdote about a Sunday school class. It effectively grounds the abstract concept of the Transfiguration in the modern struggle with belief. The preacher uses specific social encounters—a lunch in New York, a graduate student's hesitation—to create a recognizable life world for the hearer. However, the connection to the 'feeling' level remains somewhat intellectualized through the lens of 'intellectual respectability' rather than raw emotional vulnerability.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the strongest phase of the sermon. The preacher moves beyond the 'what' to the 'why,' exploring the tension between biblical glory and human suffering. She pauses significantly at the problem of the 'hiddenness' of God, using the Guatemala massacre as a profound point of reflection. The sermon resists easy answers, allowing the 'problem' of God's absence to breathe before moving to theological resolution.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The theological exposition is solid but somewhat secondary to the reflective elements. The 'big idea'—that God's glory is hidden in suffering—is clearly formulated. The exegesis of the 'cloud' motif across the three texts provides a logical framework. However, the dogmatic deepening of the Incarnation and Transfiguration remains relatively brief and relies heavily on the authority of the biblical text rather than a developed theological argument.",

      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This phase is the least developed. While the sermon calls for 'courage' and 'forthrightness' about faith, it lacks specific, concrete action steps. The application remains largely internal (believing the story) or general (being willing to say so). There is an invitation to change, but the 'how' is left to the hearer's intuition rather than being facilitated by the preacher.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of a 'Visionary-Reflective' approach. It begins with a relatable concrete experience of modern skepticism and moves into a profound reflective observation on the hiddenness of God and the reality of suffering. The preacher effectively uses the 'cloud' motif to bridge the Old and New Testaments, culminating in a theology of the cross where glory is found in suffering. While the sermon is intellectually and emotionally resonant, it falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase. The call to action is general—to be 'unashamed'—and lacks the concrete handles that would help a congregation translate these deep insights into daily practice. The use of Martin Luther King Jr. as a narrative climax is highly effective for the 'Diverging' and 'Accommodating' learning styles, but the 'Converging' learner may find the lack of practical application unsatisfying.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a sophisticated piece of homiletical work that excels in the 'Visionary' and 'Interpretive' tasks. It successfully takes the hearer through a journey of reflection on the nature of God's glory and its paradoxical presence in suffering. However, from a Kolb perspective, the cycle remains incomplete. The preacher provides the 'why' and the 'what,' but leaves the 'how' largely to the imagination of the hearer. To move from a strong sermon to a transformative learning experience, the preacher needs to bridge the gap between the 'mountaintop' vision and the 'valley' of concrete ethical action. The priority for improvement is the development of the Pragmatic/Active Experimentation quadrant."
