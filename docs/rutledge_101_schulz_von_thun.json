    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The factual dimension is robust, focusing on the tension between 'glory' (Epiphany) and the 'humility' of the Sermon on the Mount. The preacher provides a sophisticated exegetical framework, navigating the classic Pauline-Jamesian dialectic of faith and works. The 'Sache' (the living Christ) is presented as the 'New Adam' who fulfills the sermon's demands. However, the level of abstraction is high; the preacher assumes a congregation familiar with terms like 'eschatological document,' 'logizomai,' and 'gnostic secret.' While the dogmatic clarity regarding 'sola gratia' is commendable, the factual side occasionally risks becoming a lecture on hermeneutics rather than a direct proclamation of the Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "The symbiotic relationship of righteousness and mercy lies at the heart of the Beatitudes.",
        "It is a fully realized depiction of human life with the Godhead at the loom.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a personality that values order, theological precision, and intellectual integrity. There is a clear 'leakage' of concern regarding the 'average churchgoer's' lack of knowledge, suggesting a slightly pedagogical or even corrective stance. The use of literary references (Flannery O’Connor) and academic citations (Richard Lischer) reveals a preacher who finds security in external authorities and structured thought. The 'I' is largely hidden behind the 'We' of the church or the 'One' of the scholar, indicating a preference for objective truth over subjective experience. This serves the text but can feel somewhat distant.",
      "quotes": [
        "It may be doubted, however, how seriously the ordinary Christian takes the Sermon on the Mount.",
        "Preachers and teachers will always need to be alert to the challenge of getting this balance right."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive (Zwanghaft). The focus is on correctness, proper distinctions (Law/Gospel), and structural integrity. There is a fear of 'misinterpretation' and 'fatal misunderstandings.'",
      "diaconal_quality": "The self-revelation is diaconal; the preacher does not seek the spotlight but acts as a guardian of the 'pure doctrine' of grace.",
      "strengths": [

        "Demonstrates intellectual humility before the difficulty of the text."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching' and 'Paternalistic.' The preacher speaks *about* the congregation and the 'ordinary Christian' rather than *to* them in an intimate way. The 'Yellow' side is characterized by a certain distance; the preacher is the expert clarifying a difficult concept. There is a 'Relationship Noise' in the subtle critique of the 'average churchgoer,' which might make the listener feel judged or categorized as 'weak in faith.' The use of the Bruderhof as an example, while intended to be encouraging, creates a 'We (ordinary) vs. They (radical)' dynamic that might inadvertently alienate the listener.",
      "quotes": [
        "It may be doubted... how well the average churchgoer even knows it.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest side, precisely because it *refuses* to make a traditional psychological appeal. The preacher masterfully protects the 'Zuspruch' (Promise). The appeal is not 'Do this!' but 'Behold this!' and 'Become what you already are!' By framing the sermon as a gift and a description of Christ's life in us, the preacher avoids the trap of moralism. The 'Red' side is transformed into an invitation to participate in a reality already created by God. This is high-level homiletics that respects the Barthian priority of Grace.",
      "quotes": [
        "The preaching should never sound prescriptive.",
        "Become what you already are.",
        "It is his gift to all who love him and seek to follow him."

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Excellent. The 'Anspruch' (Demand) is entirely nested within the 'Zuspruch' (Gift).",

        "Theological rigor in maintaining the 'Sola Fide' framework.",
        "Effective use of 'congratulation' vs 'exhortation'."

        "The appeal to 'look at the Bruderhof' could be more clearly tied to the listener's immediate context.",

    "disruptions": "The main disruption is the 'Academic Noise'—the sermon reads more like a theological paper, which may disrupt the 'Yellow' relationship with a non-academic listener.",
    "healing_disruption": "The 'Healing Disruption' occurs when the preacher overturns the definition of 'Glory,' challenging the listener's worldly pretensions."

    "the_factual_ear_hears": "A clear, well-argued defense of the Sermon on the Mount as Gospel rather than Law.",

    "the_appeal_ear_hears": "I don't need to 'try harder' in my own strength; I need to rest in Christ's life in me.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a sophisticated theological treatise that excels in its 'Red' (Appeal) and 'Blue' (Factual) dimensions by maintaining a strict Barthian/Reformed priority of Grace over Law. It avoids the common pitfall of moralism, treating the Sermon on the Mount as a Christological 'Gift.' However, it suffers from a 'Yellow' (Relational) distance. The preacher speaks from a position of academic authority, which, while intellectually satisfying, may fail to reach the 'existential touch' required in homiletics. The 'Green' side reveals a 'Compulsive' type who prioritizes correctness over vulnerability. The inclusion of the Bruderhof provides a necessary concrete anchor, but the overall tone remains somewhat detached. It is a 'Satisfactory to Ample' performance that prioritizes the 'Fides Quae' (the faith which is believed) over the 'Fides Qua' (the act of believing).",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon successfully avoids psychologization by keeping God as the 'Acting Subject' (via the concept of 'reckoning').",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological precision regarding Law and Gospel.",
      "Excellent redefinition of 'Glory' in a Christological sense.",
      "Strong protection of the listener's freedom from moralistic pressure."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce the 'pedagogical' distance in the relational tone.",
      "Translate high-level concepts (like 'logizomai') into vernacular imagery.",
      "Increase personal 'Green' vulnerability to balance the 'Blue' intellectualism."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A theologically superior but communicatively 'cool' sermon that informs the mind more than it warms the heart."
