    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and promotes autonomy. It avoids the common homiletical trap of using the Critical Parent to demand 'Easter Joy.' Instead, it uses the Adult ego state to contrast two systems (Empire vs. Life) and invites the listener to make a conscious choice. By validating doubt (Thomas) and eagerness (Peter), it accepts the listener's internal complexity.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The definition of 'Empire' is broad; a more specific 'Adult' data-set could prevent it from becoming a 'Boogeyman' archetype.",
      "Ensure the 'must' in 'must obey God' remains a theological imperative rather than a Critical Parent command."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to frame the 'call to action' as a 'pitch' or an 'invitation to imagine' rather than a 'requirement for belonging.' This maintains the listener's Adult agency."
