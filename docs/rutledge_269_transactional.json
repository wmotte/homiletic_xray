    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and exceptionally healthy. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the 'Bait and Switch' (using grace to lure, then law to punish). By speaking from the Adult ego position, the preacher validates the listener's intelligence and emotional reality. He addresses 'monsters' without becoming a Persecutor and offers 'comfort' without becoming a smothering Nurturing Parent. The result is an authentic transaction that promotes psychological maturity and spiritual autonomy.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' to signal shared Adult inquiry. Maintain the balance of naming the 'monsters' (reality testing) while holding the 'hope' (NP/FC) without collapsing into simplistic Rescuer roles."
