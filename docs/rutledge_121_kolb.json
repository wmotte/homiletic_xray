    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is grounded in visceral, concrete experiences. It avoids abstract 'humanity' and instead uses specific, localized narratives (the Richmond security guard, the shooting in Teaneck, the Lockerbie victim). These stories are designed to evoke empathy and identification with the 'bug' (victim). The preacher successfully bridges the gap between the biblical text and the hearer's world through these 'slices of life'.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Reflection is achieved through a sharp cultural critique of the 'affluent' congregation. The preacher pauses to ask 'why' the Cross is a scandal and 'why' the congregation is more moved by zoning laws than systemic poverty. It forces the hearer to observe their own 'denial' and the psychological patterns of shifting from victim to victimizer.",

The 'Big Idea' is that God 'steers toward the pain' and pays the price for both victim and victimizer. However, the exegesis of 1 Corinthians is somewhat brief, serving more as a framework for the social commentary than a deep dive into the text itself.",

    "overall_kolb_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of narrative-driven preaching that grounds high theology in visceral human experience. It falls short primarily in the 'Active Experimentation' phase; while it diagnoses the 'white flight' and 'denial' of the affluent congregation with surgical precision, it offers a relatively safe and localized application (loving the person in the pew) that doesn't quite match the scale of the systemic problems it identifies. The sermon excels in the 'Concrete Experience' and 'Reflective Observation' phases, using local Richmond events and poignant metaphors to break through the 'sophisticated' resistance to the gospel. Theologically, it successfully reclaims 'the blood' for a mainline audience by linking it to the radical inclusion of both victims and victimizers. It is a balanced piece of homiletic work that addresses multiple learning styles, though it favors the 'Accommodating' and 'Diverging' hearers who learn through empathy and imagination.",

    "conclusion": "The sermon is a highly effective Lenten meditation that successfully navigates the 'Homiletic Window,' moving from the pain of the world to the scandal of the Cross and finally to the joy of redemption. Its greatest strength lies in its 'priestly listening' (Osmer)—the preacher clearly knows the heart and the 'denials' of the Richmond gentry. From a Kolb perspective, the cycle is nearly complete, though the transition from 'Reflective Observation' to 'Active Experimentation' is somewhat abrupt and the final application lacks the 'Converging' precision needed for systemic change. It is a '7' on the diagnostic scale: a well-developed, professional sermon that serves as a strong model for narrative preaching, requiring only more concrete 'hands-on' application to reach an '8' or '9'."
