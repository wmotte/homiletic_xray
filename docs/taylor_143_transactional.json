    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Parent-Child' homiletics. While rhetorically powerful and theologically orthodox in its focus on Christ, it relies heavily on the induction of shame and the 'Bait and Switch' game. The preacher first destabilizes the listener's Adult ego by leveling accusations of 'crass idolatry' and then offers a Rescuer's exit through an emotional appeal. This creates a cycle of guilt and relief that fosters religious dependency rather than spiritual autonomy.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to move from 'I am telling you why you should be ashamed' (Parent) to 'Let us explore together how we experience these tensions' (Adult-Adult). Avoid the 'Switch' from historical analysis to personal attack."
