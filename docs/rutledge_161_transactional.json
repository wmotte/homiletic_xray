    "summary": "This sermon is a rare example of psychologically healthy homiletics. It utilizes the Adult ego state to analyze the human condition without descending into the Critical Parent's shaming tactics. By defining repentance as 'insight' and sin as a 'theological concept' rather than a moral failure to be punished, the preacher fosters an environment of safety (NP) and intellectual honesty (A). It successfully avoids the Drama Triangle by refusing to persecute 'the evil ones' and instead promotes universal responsibility and grace.",

      "The use of archaic liturgical terms like 'wretchedness' in the prayer could be misinterpreted by listeners with a strong Adapted Child background.",
      "Could further explore the 'Free Child's' joy to balance the Lenten gravity."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'we' language to maintain the Adult-Adult transaction. Keep emphasizing that grace precedes confession to prevent the 'Bait & Switch' game."
