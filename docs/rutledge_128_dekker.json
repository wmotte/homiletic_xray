As I told the congregation on Good Friday, I am among you as one who, in the words of St. Paul, is “determined to know nothing among you except [...] His promise to return and establish his Kingdom forever and ever is true, not because I am faithful but because God is faithful, and his faithfulness is powerful to break down barricades and overthrow tyrants and raise the dead to life. He is risen! The Lord is risen indeed! Alleluia!"

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's first requirement of being an 'exposition of a specific Bible passage.' Instead of recreating one text into a current word, the preacher uses a collage of texts (Luke, 1 Corinthians, Acts, Matthew) to argue a thematic point about the physical reality of the Resurrection. It is a speech about 'the Resurrection' rather than 'THIS text.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Luke’s Easter story goes on for two more verses after the part we heard just now",
        "I have lived with the letters of the Apostle Paul for most of my fifty-eight years",
        "Go quickly,” said the angel to the women... (Matt. 28:7)"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one pericope (e.g., Luke 24:1-11) and find the unique element that exists nowhere else in Scripture, rather than harmonizing multiple accounts into a general doctrine."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is an attempt to reconstruct the psychological and historical state of the first disciples (hopelessness, disgrace), which touches on exposition. However, there is no engagement with the original languages or the specific theological nuances of the Lucan or Pauline contexts as required by Dekker.",
      "quotes": [
        "They had invested their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor in what appeared to be a mockery.",
        "The evangelist goes on to tell us that “Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James … told … the apostles... but their words seemed to them to be an idle tale”"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond psychological reconstruction of the characters and engage with the specific theological 'history' and 'context' of the biblical book itself."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part. The preacher sharply critiques the 'zeitgeist' (the Jesus Seminar, the 'spring festival' mentality) and applies the text to concrete human experiences like the death of a spouse or the mockery of nature's beauty in the face of grief.",
      "quotes": [
        "I am thinking today of a woman... One month ago, with no warning whatsoever, her husband died in his sleep.",
        "This ineffable band of spoilers delights in scandalizing the faithful.",
        "I had a friend whose child died in the spring; she said that the flowers and birds were agonizing for her, like a mockery."

      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application flows from the specificities of the text rather than from a general polemic against liberal theology."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon avoids the 'block' structure (first exegesis, then application). The hearer is drawn into the tension between the biblical narrative and modern skepticism throughout. However, because the 'exposition' is thematic rather than textual, the 'interwoveness' feels more like a topical debate.",
      "quotes": [
        "Is it possible that ideas like this would have taken hold of a tiny band of utterly demoralized... disciples...?",
        "What would she rather hear, a message about rebirth in nature, or this: “His soul was not left in hell...”"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Use the specific details of the Greek text to 'expound' the hearer's current reality simultaneously."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon operates strongly within the categories of misery (death as a 'hostile, invading power') and redemption (Christ's victory). Gratitude is less explicit but present in the concluding call to 'hope and strength.' The preacher correctly identifies death as 'damned,' avoiding a 'soft' misery.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s so damned inexorable, and I do mean damned.",
        "The New Testament refers to death as an enemy... a hostile, invading power that robs the human being of everything it was ever meant to be."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly ground the 'gratitude' (the third part) in the specific response called for by the text, rather than a general 'Alleluia'."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon addresses the 'two ways' by confronting the hearer with the choice between a 'barren' skepticism (the broad way of the Jesus Seminar) and the 'narrow way' of the Church's faith. It mentions 'being lost' in the sense of having a 'vain' faith if Christ is not raised.",
      "quotes": [
        "If Christ is not raised, our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain.",
        "I am not embarrassed to tell you today that I think the Jesus Seminar is a barren and desolate enterprise."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'temporal loss' (failing to answer God's calling) more concrete for the 'occasional' churchgoers addressed at the start."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon moves toward the victory of Christ over death as the only source of salvation outside of man. It upholds the 'two natures' implicitly by insisting on the physical resurrection of the God-man.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus is the Lord of the universe and he has turned the key in the lock of the gate of Hell.",
        "Man has no life in himself, it is Christ who is his life."

    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 1950 words, the sermon likely falls just under the 20-minute threshold in a liturgical setting with a slower pace. According to Dekker's strict rule, it lacks the 'breadth' required for full 'depth.'",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the formal exposition of the primary text to ensure the sermon exceeds 20 minutes of substantive content."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s formal definition because it is a topical address on the Resurrection rather than an exposition of a specific Bible passage. It functions as a polemic against modernism and a pastoral consolation, but it lacks the textual specificity Dekker demands. However, it succeeds in its sharp application and its refusal to 'soften' the misery of death or the objectivity of Christ's victory.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application to the 'zeitgeist' and individual grief.",
      "Strong emphasis on the 'extra nos' (outside ourselves) nature of salvation.",
      "Refusal to use 'general truths' or vague religious sentiments."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of a single underlying pericope; too many 'biblical keywords'.",
      "Absence of formal exegesis (Hebrew/Greek/Contextual theology).",
      "Length is slightly insufficient for the 'breadth' Dekker requires."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an effective theological speech, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense because it fails the formal requirement of being an exposition of one specific passage. It is a defense of a dogma rather than the recreation of a text."
