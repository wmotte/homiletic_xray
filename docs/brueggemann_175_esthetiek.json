    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon uses 'meat' as a central, visceral metaphor that anchors the entire theological argument. By grounding abstract concepts like 'greed' and 'capitalism' in the sensory reality of fat oxen, pasture-fed cattle, and fatted fowl, the preacher follows Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' principle. The imagery of 'storehouse cities' compared to modern downtown banks provides a sharp visual bridge between the biblical world and the contemporary landscape. However, the imagery occasionally leans toward the repetitive, using the list of animals multiple times to drive home a point rather than expanding the sensory palette. The 'robins and sparrows' section provides a lighter, natural contrast to the heavy, greasy imagery of the royal table, effectively creating a visual 'either/or' for the listener.",
      "quotes": [
        "Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty cors of choice flour... ten fat oxen, and twenty pasture-fed cattle.",
        "Downtown is mainly filled with banks, storehouse cities for inordinate wealth.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strong 'showing' through the inventory of Solomon's kitchen, though the latter half of the sermon shifts more toward 'telling' via socio-political commentary."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is deliberate and avoids traditional 'Canaanite' jargon, opting instead for a contemporary, almost secular vocabulary ('IRS', 'Goldman Sachs', 'fake news'). This makes the sermon highly accessible but risks 'secularizing' the text to the point where the theological nuance of 'righteousness' (tsedaqah) is flattened into modern political categories. McEntyre’s 'stewardship of language' is evident in the rhythmic repetition of 'more', which effectively mimics the anxiety it describes. However, the use of terms like 'fake news' and 'tweets' dates the sermon and may feel like 'cliché' in a different historical moment, potentially obscuring the timeless precision of the biblical witness with transient political slogans.",
      "quotes": [
        "His job is to be sure the minimum wage remains very low.",
        "The 'more system' intends to keep us frightened.",
        "The regime of anxiety is fake news."

      "jargon_analysis": "Religious jargon is almost entirely absent, replaced by socio-economic jargon which is clearly explained through the biblical narrative."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a masterly use of cadence and rhetorical repetition. The 'Never enough yet!' and 'But he died!' refrains create a staccato, percussive rhythm that mirrors the heartbeat of an anxious society. The preacher uses parallelism effectively, especially in the contrasts between Solomon and the birds. The sentence structure varies from long, descriptive lists of Solomon’s wealth to short, punchy declarations of judgment. This creates a 'musical' experience that is clearly designed for oral delivery, moving from the heavy, plodding description of the 'greed system' to the more lyrical, open-ended invitation of the 'kingdom'. It avoids 'paper language' entirely, sounding like a living voice.",
      "quotes": [
        "More grain, more wealth, more banks, more tweets, more spectator sports...",
        "He was at the edge of doing good but he died. He was at the cusp of sharing . . . but he died.",

        "The transition between the 'meat' section and the 'birds' section could be more melodically fluid.",
        "Some of the political lists become slightly monotonous in their rhythmic structure.",
        "The ending could benefit from a more poetic, rather than purely hortatory, cadence."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Exclusively oral language; the text is clearly a transcript of a performance or written specifically to be heard."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon's language is rhetorically potent, characterized by a visceral central metaphor ('meat') and a rhythmic, percussive style. It successfully bridges the gap between ancient text and modern context by using contemporary socio-economic vocabulary. While it avoids religious jargon, it occasionally flirts with political clichés. The musicality is high, utilizing repetition and parallelism to create a sense of urgency. It is a 'sober' aesthetic—not decorative, but functional and sharp, designed to pierce the listener's 'anxiety system' through linguistic precision and oral force."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by upsetting the equilibrium with the 'meat' metaphor, moves into the 'complication' of Solomon’s greed, and reaches a 'climax' with the parable of the rich fool ('...but he died!'). The movement from the 'anxiety system' to the 'alternative' of the Father’s kingdom provides a satisfying resolution. The energy is sustained through a series of 'mini-arcs' within each section. However, the transition into the final 'application' (Section IV) feels slightly more like a lecture than a narrative journey, as the preacher begins to explain the 'either/or' rather than letting the story continue to carry the weight of the movement.",
      "quotes": [
        "King Solomon was an aggressive carnivore who could not get enough meat.",
        "Get out of the anxiety system because it will destroy you!",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. Cilliers’ concept of 'reframing' is perfectly executed: the preacher takes the ancient list of Solomon’s provisions and reframes it as a modern IRS/Goldman Sachs system of exploitation. The biblical text is not a 'springboard' but a lens through which the 2018 context is viewed. The 'strangeness' of the biblical text (the cors of flour, the roebucks) is respected but made immediately relevant. The synthesis is organic; the preacher shows how the 'anxiety' of a 10th-century BC king is identical to the 'anxiety' of a 21st-century consumer. It offers a genuine 'new frame' for reality, moving the listener from 'scarcity' to 'abundance'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Solomon’s cabinet officers that sounds as contemporary as the kind of folk from Goldman Sachs.",
        "The 'more system' aims to keep us busy... who has time to think outside the box?",

      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Masterful 'reframing' of biblical greed as modern systemic anxiety.",
        "The connection between 'storehouse cities' and 'downtown banks' is a brilliant aesthetic bridge.",

        "The 'Father' concept could be more deeply rooted in the text of Luke rather than just stated."

      "reframing_present": "Yes; reality is reframed from a 'regime of anxiety' to a 'vocation of justice'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is rhetorically powerful, it leans toward a 'closed' work of art. The preacher’s 'either/or' is stark and leaves little room for the ambivalence of the hearer who might be caught in the middle. The interpretation is largely monovalent: the 'anxiety system' is bad, and 'justice' is the only way out. While Stark advocates for 'polyvalence', this sermon is more 'prophetic-declarative'. It forces the hearer into a specific socio-political interpretation. The ending, while calling for 'great faith', feels more like a moral imperative ('seek the kingdom') than an open invitation. The mystery of God is somewhat subordinated to the clarity of the political task.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus... explained to them in one-syllable words.",
        "The news is that there is an alternative to the anxiety system.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "Allow more room for the 'struggle' of those who feel trapped in the system without easy exits.",
        "End with a more 'open' image or question rather than a series of imperatives.",
        "Acknowledge the complexity of 'meat' and 'success' for those who have historically lacked it."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A largely monovalent, 'closed' work of art that functions as a prophetic challenge rather than an 'opera aperta'."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon's structure is a dynamic, narrative-driven journey that masterfully integrates biblical text with modern socio-economic reality. It uses 'reframing' to make ancient greed feel immediate and systemic. The narrative arc is strong, punctuated by the dramatic 'but he died' turning point. However, the structure is aesthetically 'closed'; it presents a stark binary that leaves little room for the listener's own interpretive ambivalence. It is a prophetic performance that prioritizes clarity of challenge over the 'polyvalence' of an open work of art."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'cheap comfort' and 'happy endings'. By focusing on the 'stench' of greed and the reality of 'death in the night', it takes the human condition seriously. There is no sentimentality here; even the 'birds and lilies' are used as a sharp rhetorical weapon against Solomon rather than as a 'cute' illustration. The preacher sustains the tension of 'not enough' rather than resolving it with a platitude. The only risk of kitsch is the slightly predictable list of modern political grievances at the end, which can become a form of 'activist kitsch' if not handled with the same depth as the biblical exegesis.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential for the 'birds and lilies' to become sentimental (though the preacher largely avoids this).",
      "The 'Christian, love me more than these' ending feels slightly more conventional than the rest of the sermon."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The bluntness of '...and then he died!'",
      "The admission that 'it is such a hard mouthful in our context.'"
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the visceral, 'meat-based' realism and avoid falling into the 'clichés of the left' to ensure the prophetic voice remains aesthetically authentic."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens a 'space for grace' by contrasting the 'anxiety system' with the 'Father's kingdom of abundance'. However, this space is frequently threatened by a strong move toward moralization. The 'vocation of justice' is presented more as a 'task' or a 'discipline' than a gift to be received. While Cilliers argues that aesthetics should open space for the 'unavailable', this sermon often makes grace 'available' only through the 'willful choice' of the disciple. The mystery of God is present in the 'creator' language, but it is quickly harnessed for the purpose of socio-political critique.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'more' and 'enough' is well-sustained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the 'Father' is acknowledged but often explained in functional, one-syllable terms.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Moralization (the call to justice) prevails over the 'soaking' in grace, though the 'bask in gifts' line offers a glimpse of the latter.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'abundance of the Father' to stand as a beautiful, unearned reality for longer before moving to the 'vocation of justice'."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is a potent example of 'Prophetic Aesthetics'. Its beauty lies not in baroque decoration or sentimental comfort, but in the 'sober beauty' of a sharp, well-aimed critique. The central metaphor of 'meat' is an aesthetic triumph, providing a sensory anchor for a complex systemic analysis. The preacher masterfully 'reframes' the biblical text, making the ancient world of Solomon feel like a mirror to 2018. The rhythm and cadence of the language are highly effective for oral delivery, creating a sense of urgency and 'holy reckoning'. However, the sermon is aesthetically limited by its 'closed' nature; it functions as a monovalent challenge that leaves little room for the listener's internal complexity or the 'polyvalence' of the gospel. It is a sermon of 'law and gospel' where the 'law' (the critique of the anxiety system) is aesthetically more developed than the 'gospel' (the mystery of the Father's kingdom).",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Visceral and culturally resonant central metaphor ('meat').",
      "Masterful integration and 'reframing' of text and context.",

      "Increase 'polyvalence' and openness for the listener's own appropriation.",
      "Balance the 'vocation of justice' (task) with more 'space for grace' (gift).",
      "Avoid transient political buzzwords to maintain aesthetic longevity."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Imagistic / Sober-Reformed",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who are socially conscious, weary of consumerism, and appreciate a direct, intellectually rigorous challenge.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer in the mystery of the kingdom.",
      "Use sensory language to describe 'grace' as vividly as 'greed' was described.",
      "Incorporate a moment of 'lament' to deepen the emotional authenticity before the call to action."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically strong performance of prophetic homiletics. It succeeds in breaking the 'fixed frames' of the listener through sharp imagery and a compelling narrative arc. While it risks becoming 'closed' through its moral urgency, its refusal of kitsch and its stewardship of language make it a significant 'event' in the sense of Immink. It is a 'sober' work of art that uses the beauty of simplicity to expose the ugliness of greed."
