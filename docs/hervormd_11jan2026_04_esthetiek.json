    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon employs a central visual metaphor: the 'blouse with stains and tears' to represent human sin and brokenness. This provides a concrete anchor for the abstract concept of sin. The preacher also utilizes the biblical imagery of 'straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel,' which is inherently vivid. However, the imagery remains somewhat limited to these two poles. While the description of the influencer's 'golden smile' vs. 'burn-out' is effective, the sermon often reverts to 'telling' rather than 'showing' when discussing grace. The imagery of 'washing white as snow' is a traditional metaphor that, while biblical, borders on a 'dead metaphor' due to its frequent use in this context without new sensory revitalization.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The language is accessible but lacks precision. There is a frequent use of 'Canaanite' jargon toward the end ('blood of Jesus', 'washed in the blood', 'old man', 'yoke'). While these are theological staples, they are not 'stewarded' with the care McEntyre advocates; they are used as shorthand. The preacher often uses filler words and repetitive structures ('en dan', 'want'), which suggests an extemporaneous style that sacrifices linguistic sharpness. The transition from the 'influencer' language to 'Reformed' language is somewhat jarring, as the precision of the modern analysis is not matched by a fresh articulation of the ancient gospel language.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon has an oral, conversational rhythm, which is appropriate for a performance ('event'). However, it lacks the poetic cadence or rhetorical 'legato' that elevates a sermon to an aesthetic experience. The sentence structures are mostly short and declarative, which creates a 'staccato' feel that works for instruction but fails to evoke the 'musicality' of grace. There is little use of alliteration, parallelism, or rhythmic repetition that would make the words 'stick'. It feels like 'spoken word' in the sense of a talk, rather than a liturgical performance of the Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "Je ziet vlekken, je ziet scheuren. Is dat ook niet zo met ons?",

    },
    "average_score_language": 5.33,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are functional but not elevated. The use of the 'stained blouse' is a strong micro-aesthetic choice that bridges the gap between the modern 'influencer' theme and the biblical text. However, the language care is mediocre, relying heavily on traditional jargon that lacks the 'stewardship' of fresh articulation. The rhythm is conversational and accessible, which suits the 'event' of a youth service, but it lacks the musicality and precision that would make the language truly resonate as an 'open work of art'."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Lowry-esque' plot: it begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' by exposing the exhaustion of the influencer lifestyle. It moves to the 'complication' (we are all influencers/Pharisees) and reaches a 'turning point' in the cross of Christ. The use of Zacchaeus and John Newton serves as narrative illustrations that provide movement. However, the energy tends to plateau in the middle due to repetitive theological explanations. The conclusion is a standard 'altar call' style invitation, which provides resolution but perhaps too predictably.",
      "quotes": [
        "Het thema van deze diensten is: Wie is jouw influencer?",
        "Zijn we ten diepste niet allemaal wel eens een Farizeeër of influencer?",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest aesthetic point. The 'reframing' (Cilliers) of the Pharisee as a first-century influencer is a creative and effective synthesis. It breaks the 'fixed frame' of the Pharisee as merely a 'bad religious person' and makes the biblical critique relevant to the digital age. The preacher successfully connects the 'outside/inside' tension of the gospel with the 'filtered/unfiltered' tension of social media. While the integration of the 'blouse' is a bit separate from the 'influencer' metaphor, they both serve the same theme of appearance vs. reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "In de tijd van Jezus waren er ook influencers... het waren schriftgeleerden, Farizeeën.",
        "Jullie maken de buitenkant schoon... maar de binnenkant van jullie is vol slechtheid.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans heavily toward 'closedness'. Following the 'New Homiletic' critique, this sermon 'tells' the hearer exactly what to think and do. The ending is highly prescriptive and moralistic in its invitation ('Kom tot Jezus'). While it speaks of 'space for grace', the structure itself doesn't leave much 'space' for the hearer's own interpretation or the 'ambivalence of existence'. It resolves the tension of the 'influencer's burn-out' very quickly with a theological 'happy ending'. It functions more as a 'closed system of truths' (Stark) than an 'open work of art'.",
      "quotes": [
        "En Jezus zag dat het goed was. Jezus kwam in zijn leven en dat zorgde voor witte kleding.",
        "Je hoeft niet meer zo rond te lopen. Dat wilde de Heer Jezus vanaf het begin.",
        "Luister naar zijn stem, en kom tot Hem. Want Hij is er. Amen."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Provides clear, unambiguous comfort to those feeling 'overtaxed'.",
        "The preacher's own vulnerability ('ik vind dat ik zelf er ook wel netjes uit zie... maar') creates a small opening for the hearer.",
        "Direct address to 'jongeren' makes them feel seen."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "End with an image or a question rather than a series of imperatives to allow for 'appropriation'.",
        "Acknowledge that 'walking with Jesus' doesn't immediately solve the 'burn-out' or 'depression' mentioned earlier.",
        "Leave some of the 'mystery' of grace intact instead of explaining it as a mechanical transaction (confess = forgiven)."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Monovalent and relatively closed; it seeks to convince and invite rather than evoke and open."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 5.67,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is defined by a brilliant initial 'reframing' of Pharisees as influencers, which provides a strong narrative hook. The integration of text and context is successful and creative. However, the dramaturgy suffers from a move toward a 'closed' structure in the second half. The sermon becomes a traditional 'proclamation of truths' that leaves little room for the hearer's own interpretive journey, resolving the complex tensions of modern life perhaps too neatly through dogmatic formulas."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 5,
    "analysis": "There is a significant risk of religious kitsch in this sermon. The 'happy ending' of Zacchaeus and the 'white as snow' imagery can feel like 'pre-chewed emotions' (Cilliers) that don't fully respect the 'pain of suffering' mentioned at the start. The transition from 'suicidal ideation/depression' to 'Amazing Grace' is very rapid, potentially offering 'immediate comfort' without sustaining the 'lament'. However, the preacher's use of the 'stained blouse' and the honest naming of 'vlekken en scheuren' provides a moment of authentic aesthetic depth that pushes back against the 'kitsch' of a perfect religious life.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The immediate resolution of Zacchaeus's life into 'witte kleding' and a 'schoon leven'.",
      "The somewhat clichéd use of the 'moordenaar aan het kruis' as a catch-all solution for 'too big' mistakes."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'vlekken en scheuren' on the preacher's own blouse.",
      "The acknowledgment that influencers (and we) 'houden zich groot... maar krijgen een inzinking'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To increase depth, spend more time in the 'between' (inter-esse). Don't wash the blouse 'white as snow' in the next sentence; let the congregation sit with the 'stains' for a while."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 5,
    "analysis": "The sermon explicitly talks about grace, but aesthetically, it 'closes' the space for it by being overly prescriptive. Cilliers' 'Space for Grace' requires a certain 'unavailability' of God, but here God is presented as a reliable solution to a modern problem. The 'mystery' is largely explained away. However, the 'reframing' of the Pharisee does open a new 'optic' for the hearer to see their own need for grace, which is a prerequisite for 'opening space'.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions (like the pressure to be perfect) are introduced but resolved quite quickly by dogmatic statements.",
    "mystery_respected": "Low; the mechanics of salvation are explained in traditional, almost technical terms.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in content, but the delivery often feels like a 'moral imperative' to believe and come to Jesus.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'silence' of God or the 'not yet' of healing to remain in the sermon. Grace is most powerful when it [plaatsnaam]s a space that hasn't been 'tidied up' by the preacher first."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 5.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a solid example of contemporary Reformed homiletics that attempts to bridge the gap between ancient scripture and digital culture. Its primary aesthetic strength lies in the 'reframing' of the Pharisee as an 'influencer', a move that is both intellectually stimulating and pastorally relevant. This creates a strong 'optics' for the congregation to view their own lives. However, the sermon struggles with 'language care' and 'openness'. As it progresses, it retreats into familiar theological jargon and a closed, prescriptive structure that tells the hearer what to feel rather than allowing them to experience the 'event' of grace. The imagery of the 'stained blouse' is a highlight of 'showing', but it is eventually overshadowed by 'telling'. The sermon avoids 'aestheticism' but falls occasionally into 'religious kitsch' by offering solutions that are perhaps too neat for the 'burn-out' and 'depression' it identifies.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Creative 'reframing' of Pharisees as influencers.",
      "Effective use of a visual aid (the stained blouse) to ground abstract concepts.",
      "Strong, relatable opening that identifies real-world 'trouble' (burn-out, perfectionism)."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduce reliance on traditional 'Canaanite' jargon in the second half.",
      "Move from a 'closed' to an 'open' structure, especially in the conclusion.",
      "Sustain the tension of human brokenness longer before moving to the theological solution."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Instructional with a 'Sober-Reformed' core.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "The 'reframing' fits Johan Cilliers, while the 'trouble/grace' structure follows Paul Scott Wilson's Four Pages, though the 'showing' could be stronger.",
    "audience_analysis": "Youth and young adults (Gen Z/Alpha) who are immersed in social media culture and feel the 'pressure to perform'.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending'—leave the congregation with a question that forces them to 'appropriate' the message.",
      "Use more 'sensory' language when describing the work of the Spirit or the 'life in abundance'.",
      "Practice 'stewardship of language' by finding fresh, non-jargon ways to describe 'the blood of Jesus' or 'sanctification'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is aesthetically 'sufficient' (5.5) because it succeeds in its primary task of 'reframing' reality through the lens of the gospel. It is not a 'model sermon' (8+) because it lacks the poetic elevation, linguistic precision, and dramaturgical 'openness' that characterize the highest level of homiletic aesthetics. It is a functional, relatable, and honest piece of preaching that would benefit from more 'space for mystery' and a more disciplined 'stewardship of the word'."
