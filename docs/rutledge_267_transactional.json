    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Rescuer' homiletics. While it is high in empathy (Nurturing Parent) and avoids the harsh 'NIGYSOB' style of older generations, it maintains a high level of psychological dependency. By defining the human condition as 'utterly incapable,' the preacher creates a vacuum that only his specific 'gift of faith' can fill. This reinforces a Parent-Child dynamic rather than an Adult-Adult invitation to spiritual growth.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as Adult partners in a mystery rather than Victims in need of a Rescuer. Instead of 'I bring you the gift of faith,' try 'Let us explore this faith together.'"
