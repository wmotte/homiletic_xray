By validating the 'Isaac' (ordinary) and 'Jacob' (flawed) aspects of the human experience, the preacher fosters an 'I'm OK, You're OK' environment. The integration of Adult-level social commentary with Nurturing Parent spiritual care creates a balanced, non-manipulative transaction.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to balance the Nurturing Parent with the Adult. To ensure the 'Rescuer' role doesn't become a game, keep emphasizing the specific, practical 'Adult' actions (like voting) that the listener can take."
