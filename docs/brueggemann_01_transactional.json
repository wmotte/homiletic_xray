    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a model of psychologically healthy homiletics. It avoids the common trap of the 'Critical Parent' (moralizing) and the 'Rescuer' (offering cheap grace). By integrating the Adult ego position (intellectual honesty about the text and the world) with the Free Child (the wonder of the Christmas story), the preacher creates a space for the listener to experience hope without coercion. The acknowledgment of shared guilt and discouragement prevents the formation of a Drama Triangle, fostering a genuine sense of community.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name the 'double bind' of the listener (e.g., feeling guilty but immobilized). This transparency prevents the 'Bait & Switch' game where grace is promised but law is delivered."
