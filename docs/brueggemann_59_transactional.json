    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games'. By operating primarily from the Adult ego state, the preacher respects the listener's autonomy. He avoids the Drama Triangle by refusing to play the Rescuer; instead, he identifies the 'Impossible' nature of the task, which prevents the listener from falling into a shame-based Adapted Child response. The use of 'we' creates a healthy, shared space for reflection.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' to maintain solidarity. Ensure that the 'Critical Parent' critiques of society don't accidentally trigger the 'Adapted Child' in the listeners by being too broad."
