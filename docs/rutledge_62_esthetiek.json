    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon employs strong, visceral imagery drawn primarily from the prophetic tradition of Ezekiel. Rutledge avoids the 'rosy' metaphors of contemporary spirituality in favor of the 'lurid imagery' of the biblical text. She effectively utilizes the contrast between 'hearts of stone' and 'hearts of flesh,' and the shocking image of the abandoned infant 'kicking in your own blood.' These images are not merely decorative; they serve the theological purpose of 'reframing' the human condition from self-sufficient to utterly dependent. The sensory language of 'stench' and 'vomit' (via Proverbs) provides a sharp, anti-kitsch aesthetic that forces the hearer to confront the gravity of sin before encountering grace.",
      "quotes": [
        "They surrounded me like bees, they blazed like a fire of thorns [wonderfully vivid, isn’t it?]",
        "Ezekiel... compares God’s people to a newborn abandoned by the roadside, lying in its own mess ('kicking in your own blood')",
        "He never stops breathing life into my dry bones."

        "Effective use of 'lurid' biblical imagery to break through modern sentimentality.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The contemporary imagery (video games, press conferences) is functional but less poetic than the biblical imagery.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strong 'showing' through the use of Ezekiel's metaphors, though the political application relies more on 'telling' and argumentation."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Rutledge exhibits high stewardship of language, consistent with McEntyre’s criteria. She avoids 'Canaanite' jargon by rigorously defining and deconstructing terms like 'righteousness.' Her language is economical and precise, particularly when navigating the tension between human agency and divine prevenience. She names cultural phenomena (self-help books, political rhetoric) with surgical precision, avoiding vague platitudes. The distinction between 'loving violence' and 'doing violence' shows a high level of intellectual and linguistic care. Every word serves the purpose of dismantling the hearer's self-justification.",
      "quotes": [
        "It seems to divide humankind neatly, like Santa Claus, into ‘naughty and nice.’",
        "There is an awful lot of flattering divination around, isn’t there? It’s a billion-dollar business.",
        "I am a rebellious house all wrapped up in one person."

      "strengths": [
        "Excellent deconstruction of religious clichés (e.g., the Santa Claus analogy).",
        "Precise theological distinctions (pre-moral, pre-virtuous).",

      "jargon_analysis": "Theological jargon (election, prevenient agency) is used but immediately grounded in concrete imagery or historical context (Lincoln/Calvinism)."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a distinct oral cadence, characterized by a 'staccato' delivery in moments of indictment and a more 'legato' flow during the proclamation of grace. Rutledge uses repetition and parallelism effectively ('I want... I don't want...'). The inclusion of the hymn 'Be Still, My Soul' adds a lyrical layer to the prose. The rhythm is that of a witness or a prophet—urgent, direct, and rhythmic. It avoids the 'paper language' of a lecture, maintaining a conversational yet authoritative tone that suggests it was written specifically for the ear.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are going to do it ourselves. We are going to work out our own salvation. We prefer the satisfaction of deserving God’s favor.",
        "I don’t want my righteousness — I want his righteousness.",
        "The days grow long, and every vision comes to nothing?"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong use of rhetorical contrast and parallelism.",
        "Natural conversational flow with effective pauses (indicated by dashes).",
        "Good variation in sentence length to build and release tension."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The middle section involving the Ezekiel citations becomes slightly heavy with 'reading' rather than 'proclaiming'.",
        "The conclusion could benefit from a more rhythmic, poetic crescendo.",
        "Some parenthetical remarks (e.g., about the gremlin) break the rhythmic solemnity."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Primarily oral language; the structure suggests a transcript of a spoken event rather than an essay."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' that rejects religious kitsch. Rutledge uses the 'lurid' imagery of Ezekiel to shock the hearer out of complacency. Her stewardship of language is evident in her precise deconstruction of 'righteousness,' moving it from a moral category to a Christological one. The rhythm is prophetic and direct, favoring clarity and impact over baroque decoration. It is a 'witness' style that uses the 'show, don't tell' principle through biblical metaphors while maintaining a sharp, contemporary edge."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a sophisticated 'Lowry-esque' plot. It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with a critique of nationalistic righteousness during wartime. This creates an immediate tension: 'Whose side is God on?' The movement then descends into the 'pit' of human helplessness (Ezekiel's abandoned infant) before the turning point: the 'performative word' of God that does what it requires. The arc moves from the 'we vs. they' of war to the 'all are unrighteous' of the cross, and finally to the 'all are loved' of the Supper. It is a dynamic journey from false certainty to true grace.",
      "quotes": [
        "Whenever there’s a war, the universal human tendency to divide up the world into ‘we’ and ‘they’ becomes even more pronounced.",
        "But the word righteous in the Scripture is not exactly as it seems.",
        "Tonight, we are all equally powerless before God, yet he loves us all."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong opening that creates immediate existential and political tension.",
        "Clear movement from law (judgment) to gospel (reckoned righteousness).",
        "Effective use of the 'missing verses' as a dramaturgical hook."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition from Lincoln to Ezekiel is intellectually stimulating but slightly slows the narrative momentum.",
        "The 'video game' section feels a bit like a detour from the main biblical arc.",
        "The ending is abrupt; it relies on the liturgical transition to the Supper which isn't fully captured in the text."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey that reframes the initial problem (war/righteousness) through a deeper theological lens."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Integration is the sermon's greatest strength. Rutledge performs a masterclass in 'reframing' (Cilliers). She takes the contemporary context (2005 Iraq War) and places it under the 'optics' of Ezekiel and Psalm 118. She resists the 'kitsch' of simple political alignment, instead using the biblical text to subvert both nationalistic pride and individualistic self-help. The 'strangeness' of Ezekiel is not smoothed over but used to illuminate the 'strangeness' of a God who takes sides by being against our self-righteousness. The synthesis is organic; the text speaks to the context without being enslaved by it.",
      "quotes": [
        "This suggests America today. We have been taught to think of ourselves as the elect, the ‘indispensable nation.’",
        "God’s purpose is something different from the purpose of either party.",
        "The Commandments will cease to be tablets of stone that judge us, and they will be written in our hearts."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Bold 'reframing' of national identity through the lens of exile and judgment.",
        "Honors the 'otherness' of the Old Testament prophets.",
        "The application (conduct toward prisoners) flows directly from the theological core."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection to 'Thanksgiving' (the requested theme) feels slightly forced or secondary to the war theme.",
        "Could have integrated the 'Calvin College' context more deeply beyond the 'prevenient agency' mention.",
        "The 'Kill Bill' reference feels slightly dated/context-specific."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes, it offers a radical new frame: God is on the side of what He is doing in us, which is often against what we are doing in ourselves."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is theologically 'closed' in its insistence on the sovereignty of grace (a Reformed characteristic), it remains an 'open work' (Stark) by refusing to offer easy moralistic 'to-do' lists. It leaves the hearer in the 'space of the between'—between their own 'rebellious house' and God's 'performative word.' However, the authoritative tone and the strong polemic against self-help and political rhetoric might feel 'sealed' to those outside the Reformed tradition. It invites the hearer into the mystery of the Supper, which is the ultimate 'open' ending.",
      "quotes": [
        "But the tantalizing question still remains: What does it mean to say... that ‘the Lord is on my side’?",
        "It makes absolutely no sense if we think of righteousness in the usual way.",
        "Tonight, we are all equally powerless before God."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Avoids moralistic 'happy endings' or simple checklists.",
        "Leaves room for the 'mystery' of how God transforms the heart.",
        "Approaches the hearer as a mature partner capable of handling 'lurid' truth."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The polemic against 'self-help' can feel a bit like a closed door to certain hearers.",
        "The theological framework is very sturdy, which can sometimes limit the 'polyvalence' of the text.",
        "The conclusion relies heavily on the 'Supper' to provide the openness."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly open; it invites participation in a divine event rather than just agreement with a set of propositions."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is expertly crafted, moving from the 'equilibrium' of nationalistic pride to the 'disorientation' of divine judgment, and finally to the 'reorientation' of Christ's righteousness. It is a classic 'Homiletical Plot' that uses the tension of the Iraq War to drive the hearer toward the necessity of grace. The integration of text and context is seamless, providing a 'reframing' of reality that is both uncomfortable and liberating. The structure is designed to lead the congregation to the Table, where the 'event' of grace occurs."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is a profound rejection of religious kitsch. Rutledge explicitly attacks 'flattering divinations' and 'rosy pictures' of the self. By using images of 'vomit,' 'blood,' and 'dry bones,' she bypasses sentimentality in favor of authentic aesthetic depth. She refuses to offer 'immediate comfort' without first sustaining the 'pain of judgment.' The use of Lincoln’s 'Meditation' further anchors the sermon in a sober, tragic, and ultimately hopeful reality that avoids the 'happy ending' cliché of much contemporary preaching.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'Santa Claus' approach to righteousness (naughty and nice).",
      "The 'self-help' potentiality mentioned as a 'billion-dollar business'."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission: 'I am a rebellious house all wrapped up in one person.'",
      "The refusal to let 'nice American boys' off the hook regarding the love of violence."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'cruciform' aesthetic; it is the strongest defense against the trivialization of the gospel."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a textbook example of Cilliers' 'Space for Grace.' By systematically dismantling human 'tents of righteousness,' Rutledge creates a vacuum that only divine grace can fill. She sustains the tension between 'already' and 'not yet' by acknowledging the ongoing struggle within the believer. The 'space' is opened not by human effort, but by the 'performative word' of God. It respects the mystery of election while making it an operative reality for the 'unrighteous' hearer.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between being a 'rebellious house' and being 'conformed to Christ' is held until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, the 'how' of the new heart is left to the 'Lord’s doing' which is 'marvelous' (unavailable for explanation).",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails entirely; moralization is explicitly identified as the 'enemy' of the gospel.",
    "recommendation": "Continue to emphasize the 'prevenience' of God as the source of beauty and space."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.8,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high point of Reformed aesthetic preaching. It rejects the 'visual excess' of sentimentality in favor of a 'sober beauty' found in the biblical word. Rutledge demonstrates that 'how' one speaks of righteousness is inseparable from the 'what' of the gospel: if righteousness is a gift, the language must be one of 'witness' and 'reception,' not 'instruction' or 'manipulation.' The aesthetic power lies in the 'reframing' of the American political and spiritual landscape through the 'lurid' and 'vivid' lenses of Ezekiel and the Psalms. It is a performance of 'the holy happening' through the proclamation of a word that 'performs what it requires.' While the tone is authoritative and the theological framework is rigid, it creates a spaciousness for the hearer by removing the burden of self-justification. The sermon is aesthetically successful because it refuses to be 'pretty,' choosing instead to be 'true' to the jagged edges of both the biblical text and the human heart.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Radical 'reframing' of contemporary political context through prophetic texts.",
      "Total absence of religious kitsch and sentimentality.",
      "High stewardship of language and precision in theological definitions."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase the 'musicality' of the concluding section to match the intensity of the middle.",
      "Further develop the 'showing' of the 'gates of righteousness' to balance the 'telling' of the political critique.",
      "Soften the polemic against 'self-help' to ensure it doesn't close the 'open work' for seekers."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Reframing (Sober-Reformed)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Thomas Long (Preacher as Witness).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to intellectually rigorous hearers, those weary of 'therapeutic' preaching, and those seeking a 'thick' theological response to political crisis.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Explore more 'legato' poetic passages to balance the 'staccato' prophetic indictments.",
      "Experiment with more 'open' endings that leave the hearer in the 'mystery' without a concluding 'Amen' that feels like a full stop.",
      "Use more 'homely' imagery alongside the 'lurid' to show grace in the mundane."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, aesthetically coherent sermon that honors the Reformed tradition's emphasis on the Word while embracing the 'aesthetic turn' through vivid imagery and dramaturgical tension. It is an excellent example of how the 'form' of the sermon (witnessing to a performative word) matches its 'content' (the sovereignty of grace). It avoids the pitfalls of both moralism and aestheticism, achieving a 'sober beauty' that is transparent toward the mystery of God."
