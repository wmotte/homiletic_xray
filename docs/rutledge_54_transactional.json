  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and exceptionally healthy. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state that validates the Nurturing Parent (God/Grandmother) and the Free Child (the listener's identity). By admitting she has never heard God's audible voice, the preacher eliminates the 'holier-than-thou' game and establishes a transparent, Adult-Adult contract with the audience. The focus on 'unconditional love' and 'individual name' provides a strong sense of 'I'm OK, You're OK.'",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of honesty and vulnerability regarding personal experience.",
      "Avoidance of shaming tactics despite the 'doom' present in the biblical text.",
      "Strong integration of psychological insights with theological narrative."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The critique of modern children's attention spans borders on a 'Critical Parent' stance that could alienate younger parents.",
      "The transition from Eli's 'doom' to 'faithful trust' is a bit rapid and could use more Adult processing of the tragedy."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I-statements' about spiritual experience. This prevents the 'Rescuer' role and keeps the transaction Adult-Adult, allowing the congregation to find their own 'Free Child' response to the divine."
