    "logos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear, traceable architecture that moves from the communal/historical (the Jewish-Christian relationship) to the personal/existential (Peter’s denial and restoration). The preacher uses a deductive approach to handle the difficult 'anti-Jewish' sentiments in the lectionary, providing a logical theological correction: if Jesus died for all sinners, then no specific group is uniquely guilty. The transition to the narrative of Peter is logically linked through the theme of 'betrayal.' However, the connection between the first half (Jewish-Christian relations/Holocaust) and the second half (Peter’s personal shame) feels slightly bifurcated. The 'bitter taste' metaphor serves as the logical bridge, but the shift from global politics to individual psychology is abrupt.",
      "quotes": [
        "Who killed Jesus? All of us sinners killed him. We will just have to keep on saying that and remembering that, so that these terrible misunderstandings will no longer occur.",
        "Many commentators over the centuries have stressed the point that Jesus was condemned by church and state... the point being that he was intolerable to everybody.",
        "The three and final exchange goes like this: 'Peter was distressed that Jesus had asked him a third time... Peter is not only forgiven, you see; he is completely made new.'"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of the 'threefold denial vs. threefold restoration' symmetry.",
        "Clear logical refutation of the 'Christ-killer' myth through systematic theology.",
        "Traceable movement from the biblical text to contemporary social examples (Oklahoma City bombing, New York Knicks)."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Strengthen the logical link between the Charlie Ward/Holocaust section and the Peter narrative; they currently feel like two separate sermons joined by a thin thread.",
        "Clarify the causal connection between 'tasting oneself as bitter' and the act of 'feeding sheep.'",
        "The transition from the 'blue wall of silence' to Peter’s guilt is a bit of a logical leap that could be more tightly argued."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Strong internal consistency within sections, but the macro-structure suffers from a thematic split between social-historical justice and personal redemption."
    },
    "pathos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating emotional resonance by tapping into the universal experience of shame and the 'bitter taste' of one's own failures. The use of the Gerard Manley Hopkins quote provides a visceral, sensory anchor for the feeling of guilt. The preacher effectively uses 'slices of life,' such as the father of an Oklahoma City bombing victim and the frail Pope at the Western Wall, to evoke empathy and awe. The emotional tone shifts skillfully from the heavy seriousness of the Shoah to the 'pure oxygen' of the Resurrection, and finally to the intimate, slightly painful restoration of Peter. It avoids manipulation by grounding the emotion in recognizable human struggles like the inability to 'hold one's head up.'",
      "emotional_tone": "Reflective and penitential, moving toward a quiet, hopeful joy.",
      "quotes": [
        "Peter must have choked on the food; the words of Gerard Manley Hopkins in one of his sonnets describe it perfectly.... God's most deep decree / Bitter would have me taste: my taste was me.",
        "How could he ever survive the guilt and the shame? Shame is the right word here, surely.",
        "He does not ask you if you have been good. He does not ask you if you have obeyed the rules... He just asks you, Do you love me?"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Visceral imagery of 'choking on food' and 'bitter taste' makes the abstract concept of sin palpable.",
        "Strong identification with the character of Peter as an 'adored child' who speaks before thinking.",
        "Effective use of contemporary tragedies (Columbine, McVeigh) to ground the biblical concept of betrayal in modern pain."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The emotional weight of the Holocaust section is so heavy it threatens to overshadow the grace-filled conclusion.",
        "Could benefit from more sensory detail regarding the 'pure oxygen' of the Resurrection to balance the 'bitter taste' of the shame.",
        "The appeal to 'nonreligious people' who 'harbor a secret desire to be persuaded' could be more affectively developed."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "High affective power through the use of poetic metaphor and contemporary tragedy, successfully bridging the gap between the ancient text and the hearer's heart."
    },
    "ethos": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher establishes exceptional credibility through a combination of humility, ecumenical sensitivity, and personal vulnerability. By acknowledging the 'serious theological issues dividing Protestants and Catholics' while expressing 'greatest regard' for the host congregation, the speaker builds an immediate bridge of trust. Most importantly, the preacher places themselves under the judgment of the message, admitting to knowing the 'bitter taste' of self. This is not a distant teacher but a 'witness' who stands alongside the congregation. The authority claimed is not personal but derived from a submissive reading of Scripture and a shared identity as a sinner.",
      "authenticity": "High; the preacher explicitly includes themselves in the category of those who find the taste of self bitter.",
      "quotes": [
        "I nevertheless repeat what I said in this pulpit in 1993—we have many reasons to be deeply grateful to you.",
        "Do you know, along with Peter and Father Hopkins and your preacher this morning, that the taste of yourself is bitter?",
        "Who killed Jesus? All of us sinners killed him."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent ecumenical 'captatio benevolentiae' that respects the Catholic context without compromising the preacher's identity.",
        "The preacher acts as a witness rather than a moralist, using 'we' and 'us' throughout.",
        "Vulnerability is used strategically to validate the sermon's central claim about shame and grace."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The reliance on New York Times columnists (Steinfels, Mendelsohn) for cultural authority might come across as slightly 'ivory tower' to some hearers.",
        "Could share a more specific (though brief) personal moment of 'bitterness' to deepen the vulnerability beyond the poetic quote.",
        "Ensure that the praise for Catholic social action doesn't feel like 'flattery' but remains grounded in the shared mission."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The preacher’s ethos is the sermon's strongest suit, characterized by a 'witnessing-visionary' stance that is both humble and authoritative."

    "dominant_mode": "Ethos",

    "balance_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon is well-balanced but leans heavily on the credibility and presence of the speaker (Ethos) and the emotional weight of the examples (Pathos). The Logos provides a necessary framework, especially in the difficult opening section regarding Jewish-Christian relations, but it serves more as a container for the affective and personal elements. The three modes reinforce each other well: the logical conclusion that 'all are sinners' (Logos) is made felt through the 'bitter taste' (Pathos) and is validated by the preacher's own confession (Ethos).",
    "consequences_of_imbalance": [
      "The intellectual hearer might find the transition between the Charlie Ward controversy and Peter's restoration logically thin.",
      "The heavy reliance on Ethos means the sermon's power is highly dependent on the preacher's delivery and perceived sincerity.",
      "The 'Pathos' of the Holocaust is so strong it may distract some from the specific 'Logos' of the John 21 exegesis."
    ],
    "recommendation_for_balance": "Tighten the logical connection between the communal guilt discussed in the first half and the personal shame discussed in the second half to ensure the Logos is as robust as the Ethos."

    "overall_rhetorical_score": 7,
    "summary": "This is a strong, professionally crafted sermon that effectively navigates a complex liturgical and social context. The preacher successfully addresses a sensitive contemporary issue (the Charlie Ward controversy and anti-Semitism) by grounding it in a robust theology of universal sin. The transition to the personal narrative of Peter is handled with poetic sensitivity, primarily through the 'bitter taste' metaphor. While the logical structure between the two main halves could be more integrated, the sermon's emotional resonance and the preacher's credible, humble persona carry the message effectively. It avoids the pitfalls of moralism by focusing on the 'transforming power of the risen Lord' rather than human effort. The use of high-quality literary and journalistic references elevates the intellectual tone without sacrificing heart-felt appeal.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional ecumenical Ethos and sensitivity to the host congregation's tradition.",
      "Visceral and memorable use of the 'bitter taste' metaphor to describe shame.",
      "Courageous and clear handling of difficult biblical texts regarding 'the Jews'."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Improve the macro-structural transition between the social/political opening and the personal/devotional core.",
      "Reduce reliance on 'The New York Times' as a primary source of cultural authority to broaden audience appeal.",
      "Anchor the 'feeding sheep' commission more firmly in the application—what does this look like for the layperson?"
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Witnessing-Visionary",
    "audience_analysis": "Urban, educated, socially-conscious Christians (specifically Roman Catholics) and 'seekers' who are intellectually skeptical but emotionally open.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Try to find a central metaphor that unifies the social and personal aspects of the text from the beginning.",
      "Incorporate more 'low-culture' or everyday examples alongside the literary and journalistic ones.",
      "Spend more time on the 'recreation' aspect—what does the 'new creature' do after the breakfast on the beach?"
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a model of 'credible speaking' in a guest-preaching context. It achieves a 7/10 by balancing a difficult theological correction with a deeply personal invitation to grace. Its primary strength lies in its Ethos—the preacher comes across as a fellow traveler in the journey of faith, making the 'bitter taste' of sin palatable through the 'sweetness' of promised restoration. While the Logos could be more tightly wound, the sermon successfully serves the whole person: head, heart, and hands."
