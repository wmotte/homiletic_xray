        "analysis": "The CP is redirected toward systemic injustice (the 'Byrd machine', 'thick-headed judges') rather than the listener. There is no 'must' or 'should' directed at the audience until the very end, and even then, it is an invitation to witness.",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of clerical manipulation. By operating primarily from the Adult ego state, the preacher respects the intellectual and moral autonomy of the congregation. He uses the 'Critical Parent' energy not to beat the flock, but to name systemic injustice. The use of the Earl Ruffin story is handled with 'Adult' reality-testing—acknowledging that some things cannot be made right—rather than a 'Parental' demand for cheap, sentimental forgiveness. The result is an invitation to agency rather than a demand for compliance.",
    "strengths": [
      "High Adult-to-Adult engagement through linguistic and historical analysis.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Slight risk of the 'Rescuer' role in the conclusion's call to help the 'voiceless'.",
      "Could incorporate more 'Free Child' spontaneity to balance the heavy 'Adult' data processing."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to ground ethical calls in 'Adult' reality-testing. To maintain this level of health, ensure that the 'Nurturing Parent' calls to help others always emphasize the autonomy and dignity of the person being helped to avoid the 'Rescuer' trap."
