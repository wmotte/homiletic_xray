    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The sermon avoids 'ITHY' (I'm Only Trying To Help You) because the preacher identifies as a fellow sufferer rather than a superior rescuer. It avoids 'NIGYSOB' by focusing on worthiness through suffering rather than unworthiness through sin."

    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely free of manipulative 'games.' It utilizes a Nurturing Parent ego state to validate the listener's reality while using the Free Child's creativity to offer a redemptive narrative. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the 'Critical Parent' by replacing judgment with empathy. The emphasis on 'risking grandly' encourages Adult responsibility and Free Child spontaneity.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of empathy and validation.",
      "Avoidance of 'shame-based' motivation.",
      "Strong identification between preacher and listener (Adult-Adult/NP-FC)."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Slight risk of making suffering seem 'required' for value.",
      "Could include more 'Adult' data on how to practically process trauma."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'I' and 'We' statements to maintain a level playing field. Ensure that the 'power of the scar' does not inadvertently encourage people to remain in abusive situations for the sake of 'spiritual growth.'"
