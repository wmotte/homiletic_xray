    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in the pulpit. By utilizing an Adult-Adult transaction, the preacher respects the listener's intelligence and agency. The analysis of fear is not used to induce guilt (Critical Parent) but to provide a reality-check (Adult). The transition from the 'Adapted Child' (fearful compliance) to the 'Free Child' (joyful emancipation) is handled with theological and psychological sophistication. It promotes autonomy rather than dependency on the religious institution.",

      "The definition of 'love' could be even more 'Adult' by providing more concrete examples of 'neighborly management' to avoid it sounding like a 'Nurturing Parent' abstraction."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name the 'social' vs 'psychological' levels of the text. By being honest about 'stacking the cards,' you prevent the 'Bait & Switch' game and maintain Adult-to-Adult integrity."
