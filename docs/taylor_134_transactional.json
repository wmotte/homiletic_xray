It utilizes the 'Nurturing Parent' to provide comfort while simultaneously using the 'Critical Parent' to enforce a high-anxiety moral code. By actively discouraging 'logic' and 'formulation,' it bypasses the listener's Adult ego, fostering dependency on the preacher’s interpretation of the 'mysterious.' The shift from the beauty of birth to the 'mud' of sin creates a classic Bait & Switch dynamic.",

Instead of saying 'logic is unworthy,' ask 'How do we responsibly live in the tension of what we know and what we don't?' Reduce the 'NIGYSOB' potential by framing Moses' story as a human struggle rather than a terrifying warning of 'severe judgment' for 'trivial' acts."
