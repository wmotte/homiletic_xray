    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Nurturing Parent' language being used to deliver a 'Critical Parent' payload. While it speaks beautifully of God's love, it psychologically anchors the listener in a state of 'Adapted Child' dependency. By insisting that 'there is no health in us,' it risks creating a shame-based identity where the listener's only value is their 'wretchedness' which God then 'rescues.' This maintains a Drama Triangle dynamic rather than moving toward Adult-Adult spiritual maturity.",

      "Strong use of metaphor to explain complex Trinitarian concepts.",

      "Over-reliance on shame-based identity ('miserable offenders').",
      "Lack of Adult-Adult invitation for the listener to find 'health' or 'agency' through their faith."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as 'Adults' who are capable of choosing the good, rather than 'Children' who are inherently self-destructive. Replace the 'I'm Only Trying To Help You (by telling you how sick you are)' dynamic with an Adult-Adult exploration of how God's love empowers human agency and health."
