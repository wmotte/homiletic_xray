  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. It utilizes a 'Rescue' dynamic that requires the listener to adopt a 'Victim' or 'Adapted Child' (fearful) stance to access the 'Nurturing Parent' (grace). By equating 'holy dread' with 'blessing,' it creates a psychological loop where the listener must feel defective to feel connected to the divine. The metaphor of the sleeping addict receiving money is the height of dependency-creation, stripping the individual of Adult agency.",

      "Clear articulation of the 'Rescuer' theology."

      "Over-reliance on the 'Victim' identity for the congregation.",
      "Conflation of 'reverence' with 'terror' to bypass Adult reasoning.",
      "Lack of an 'Adult' call to action or ethical responsibility beyond 'receiving'."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Address the congregation as Adults capable of choosing response-ability. Instead of 'putting money in the blanket' of a sleeping person, invite the listener to 'wake up' and collaborate with grace. Move from a Drama Triangle (Rescuer/Victim) to an Adult-Adult partnership where grace empowers rather than infantilizes."
