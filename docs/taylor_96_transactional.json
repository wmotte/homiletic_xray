It effectively diagnoses national 'pathologies' but risks trapping the listener in a 'Victim' role within the Drama Triangle by painting a picture of overwhelming 'rightist poison' and 'fascism.' The primary psychological impact is one of 'righteous endurance' rather than 'autonomous action.' While it avoids the crudest forms of manipulation, it relies heavily on the 'Ain't It Awful' game to build solidarity through shared grievance.",

      "Heavy use of Critical Parent 'shame' language (cravenness, cowed).",
      "Tendency to infantilize the audience as people who just need to 'hold on' rather than act."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward a 10/10 health score, the preacher could invite the congregation's Adult ego state to collaborate on solutions rather than just 'holding their holt.' Shifting from 'I throw out that word to you' (Parent->Child) to 'What shall we do with this reality?' (Adult->Adult) would reduce the 'Rescuer' dynamic."
