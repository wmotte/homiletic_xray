    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The factual content is heavily weighted toward biographical and political narrative rather than exegetical depth. The preacher uses Acts 1:8 as a springboard to discuss Liberation Theology and the life of Oscar Romero. While the 'Sache' (the living Christ) is present through the lens of the 'witness', the biblical text itself is not unpacked in its historical or linguistic context. The theological focus is on the 'continuity of the cause' rather than the transcendence of the Resurrection. The factual side serves to provide a historical-political framework for the concept of 'witnessing', moving quickly from Jerusalem to El Salvador and Hamburg. The dogmatic substance is thin, replaced by ethical-political examples.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a strong identification with the struggle for justice and a fascination with the 'humanity' of saints. There is a conscious attempt to appear humble and 'learning' alongside the congregation ('Von den Armen lernen'). However, there is a slight 'Hysterical' tendency in the sense of seeking the 'grand stage' of global martyrdom to validate the local message. The preacher reveals a faith that is deeply rooted in political solidarity. The 'I' is largely diaconal, serving the narrative of Romero, yet the choice of examples (the hunger of the Bishop) reveals a specific preference for vulnerability as a mark of authenticity.",
      "quotes": [
        "Eine andere Geschichte hat mich noch mehr bewegt, weil sie so menschlich ist.",

      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive-Hysterical mix. The preacher seeks harmony with the 'poor' and the 'suffering' (Depressive) while using dramatic, high-stakes narratives of martyrdom to create emotional impact (Hysterical).",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as a 'solidarity of learners'. The preacher places themselves on the same level as the congregation ('Auch wir werden Zeugen sein'). There is a clear 'We-definition' that includes the listener in a global movement of truth-seekers. However, there is a subtle 'paternalistic' undertone when the preacher dismisses 'experts' or 'stupid opinions', which might alienate listeners who do not share the preacher's specific political-theological framework. The tone is encouraging but carries the weight of a 'call to arms', which can feel like a subtle 'from above' pressure to conform to a specific type of activism.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily appeal-oriented. The 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is that the dead live and we receive power, but this is immediately converted into an 'Anspruch' (Demand) to be witnesses, to be brave, and to 'learn from the poor'. The ratio is skewed toward Law (the demand for courage and truth-telling) rather than Gospel (the finished work of Christ). The 'Gift' of the Spirit is presented as a tool for the 'Task' of justice. For a listener who feels weak or cowardly, this sermon increases pressure rather than providing the 'Rest' Barth or Immink would emphasize. The appeal is for behavioral change and political awareness.",
      "quotes": [
        "Auch wir werden Zeugen sein.",

    "dominant_side": "Red (Appeal)",
    "disruptions": "The transition from the Resurrection of Christ to the 'organizing' of a labor leader creates a theological category error that causes 'noise' for the dogmatic ear.",
    "healing_disruption": "The story of Romero's failure (the microphone incident) serves as a healing disruption, breaking the 'ideal saint' image to allow for human frailty."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 5.5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of Liberation Theology homiletics. It successfully bridges the gap between a 1st-century text and 20th/21st-century political reality. However, from a strict homiletical perspective, it suffers from an 'Appeal-overload'. The theological 'Sache' (Christ) is frequently instrumentalized to serve an ethical goal (Justice). While the use of Oscar Romero is narratively compelling, it risks 'psychologizing' the Resurrection into mere 'social influence'. The preacher's tone is solidary but carries a latent legalism—the 'Law of Courage'. The Barthian concern here would be that God is no longer the 'Acting Subject' but the 'Cause' that humans must carry forward. The communicative integrity is maintained through sincerity, but the theological depth is sacrificed for rhetorical mobilization.",
    "barthian_warning": "High risk of psychologization and sociologization. The 'Spirit' is reduced to human 'Mut und Wahrheitsfähigkeit' (courage and truth-capacity), making God an object of human ethical endeavor.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Powerful narrative illustrations.",
      "Strong local and global connectivity.",
      "Authentic emotional engagement."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Increase exegetical focus on the Holy Spirit as a gift, not just a task.",
      "Balance the 'Anspruch' with more 'Zuspruch' for the weary listener.",
      "Avoid polemical language regarding 'experts' and 'the Vatican' to reduce relationship noise."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A satisfactory, highly motivated sermon that functions well as a call to action but lacks the theological 'rest' and exegetical rigor required for a higher score."
