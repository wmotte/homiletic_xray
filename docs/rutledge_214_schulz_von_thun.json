It is called the Great Fifty Days because it lasts from Easter Day to Pentecost. But does that really matter? [...] Rejoice today. For this is the God who raises the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence. Christ is risen! The Lord is risen indeed! Alleluia! AMEN.",

    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates a high degree of biblical-theological competence. The 'Sache' (the matter at hand) is clearly the Resurrection as an act of God, not a human sentiment. The sermon effectively contrasts 'generic spirituality' with the specific, historical claim of the New Testament. By citing the context of Paul’s letters and the early church's consensus, the preacher provides a solid dogmatic foundation. The theological depth is found in the definition of God as the 'Acting Subject' (Immink) who calls into existence what does not exist. However, the exegesis remains somewhat at the service of the polemic against modern skepticism, which occasionally simplifies the complexity of the Corinthian 'mystical union' to fit a modern 'Oprah' analogy.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a personality that values intellectual honesty and historical continuity. There is a palpable 'I wonder' that suggests the preacher struggles alongside the congregation with the weight of the claim. However, there is a distinct 'Compulsive' (Riemann) quality in the need to define terms and correct 'naysayers.' The preacher reveals themselves as a guardian of the 'true' gospel against the 'calamitous' misunderstanding of Paul. The self-revelation is largely diaconal, as the personal anecdotes (the dinner group, Charlottesville) serve to illustrate the insufficiency of human memory compared to divine action, rather than to center the preacher's ego.",

        "I wonder how many of you here this morning really believe...",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching' and 'Corrective.' The preacher addresses the congregation as 'dear people of God,' but the dominant tone is one of a supervisor correcting a drift toward 'generic spirituality.' There is a slight paternalistic 'we-definition' where the preacher assumes the congregation is 'immune to the skeptical voices.' The 'yellow' signal is one of authority: the preacher knows the difference between 'teethless' religion and the 'real' Gospel. This creates a distance; the preacher stands slightly 'above' the congregation as the one who restores the correct perspective.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The appeal is masterfully handled because it is almost entirely 'Zuspruch' (Promise). The 'red' side is not a demand for moral effort, but an appeal to *trust* in the God who acts. The preacher avoids the 'Law' trap by framing the solution to the 'terrorist infrastructure of the heart' as something 'beyond the imagination of man'—i.e., a gift. The appeal is to 'Rejoice today.' The ethical implications (segregation, apartheid) are presented as the *fruit* of faith (gratitude), not the *condition* for it. This is a strong Barthian move: the demand is hidden within the gift.",
      "quotes": [
        "Rejoice today.",
        "In order to grasp even a tiny bit of its newness we have to imagine letting go of everything else.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7,
    "summary": "This is a robust, theologically sound sermon that prioritizes the 'Sache' of the Gospel over psychological comfort. Following the Hamburg school, the 'Blue' side is dominant, providing a clear, dogmatic framework that resists the 'psychologization' of the Resurrection. The preacher successfully avoids the 'Hysterical' type, remaining a 'diaconal' servant of the text. However, the 'Yellow' side (relationship) is somewhat stiff; the preacher speaks *at* the congregation's potential skepticism rather than *with* their lived experience. Theologically, it is a triumph of Barthian 'Zuspruch,' correctly identifying God as the sole actor in the Resurrection. The 'Riemann' diagnosis of a Compulsive/Schizoid tendency explains the focus on historical reliability and doctrinal boundaries. While the sermon lacks the 'non-committal warmth' of the Depressive type, its sharpness serves the 'Healing Disruption' required to move the congregation from a vague 'immortal memory' to a living encounter with the Risen Christ.",
    "barthian_warning": "Minimal psychologization. The preacher correctly refuses to ground the Resurrection in the disciples' 'experience,' insisting on God's objective action.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological integrity (Zuspruch over Anspruch).",
      "Effective use of contemporary political metaphors.",
      "Clear polemic against the dilution of the Gospel."

    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Soften the paternalistic 'teaching' tone.",
      "Bridge the gap between historical fact and personal existential touch.",
      "Reduce the focus on 'correcting' the audience to allow more room for 'inviting' them."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, intellectually rigorous sermon that maintains communicative integrity by aligning its authoritative tone with the sovereign nature of its subject matter."
