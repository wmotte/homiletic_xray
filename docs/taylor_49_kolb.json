    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience primarily through the use of personal anecdotes and vivid imagery of the crucifixion. The preacher connects with the 'life world' through humor about aging and the specific social context of the African American community. However, the initial 'hook' is diluted by excessive introductory pleasantries that do not serve the theological theme. The most effective concrete experience occurs late in the sermon with the encounter on the golf course.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher pauses to analyze the human condition, specifically the 'problem' of pride and racism. He offers a cultural critique of both the American judicial system and the internal fractures within the black community. He asks 'why' the nation is stuck, pointing to a lack of humility and confession.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon engages with the 'Carmen Christi' of Philippians 2. The preacher formulates the 'big idea' as the 'grandeur of our great Savior.' While the theological language is elevated ('arcane regions', 'transactions of the Trinity'), the actual exegesis is more descriptive than analytical. It captures the 'what' of the text but lacks a deep logical unfolding of the 'how' of the incarnation.",

      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the preacher calls for humility, the 'how' remains largely abstract. There are no concrete action steps for the hearer to implement 'the mind of Christ' in their daily life, other than a general call to 'not walk away indifferent.' The application is more about an internal emotional state (hope/reverence) than ethical action.",

    "overall_kolb_score": 5.8,
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of the African American homiletical tradition, emphasizing visionary language, social critique, and emotional resonance. It functions well as a 'Diverging' and 'Visionary' piece, excelling in Reflective Observation and Concrete Experience. However, it falls short of a complete Kolb cycle due to a significant lack of Active Experimentation. The preacher identifies deep social and spiritual 'chasms' but offers 'reverence' and 'hope' as the primary responses, rather than concrete ethical or spiritual practices. The introduction is disproportionately long and focused on social pleasantries, which delays the movement into the theological core. While the theological language is sophisticated, it remains somewhat detached from the practical 'how-to' of the Christian life. The sermon will deeply move the 'Diverging' learner but may leave the 'Converging' learner without a clear path forward.",

      "Integrate the biblical exegesis more tightly with the social commentary"
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a rhetorically powerful and intellectually sophisticated address that succeeds in creating a sense of awe and reflection. From a Kolb perspective, it is an incomplete cycle, leaning heavily on the 'feeling' and 'watching' quadrants while neglecting the 'doing.' It functions more as a theological meditation than a transformative learning experience that equips the hearer for specific action. The priority for improvement is the development of the Pragmatic task: converting high-level Christological vision into the 'servant leadership' of the congregation."
