    "summary": "The sermon is a sophisticated example of using 'Religious Parent' ego states to drive 'Adapted Child' behavior. While theologically orthodox, the psychological movement relies on creating a deficit (guilt/short checklists) and then offering a specific institutional solution (stewardship). The preacher's self-deprecation acts as a 'Con' to make the Critical Parent position more palatable.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Shift from 'Parent-Child' (Judgment/Compliance) to 'Adult-Adult' (Shared Responsibility). Instead of using the Moritzes as a 'Critical Parent' stick to beat the congregation, use them as a 'Free Child' inspiration for what is possible when one is free from the love of money."
