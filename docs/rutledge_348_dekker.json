On the hilltop there is a small cemetery set within a grove of tall evergreen trees. Here the fathers and brothers are buried when they die. The tombstones are white crosses [...] Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God and in believing, receive the gift of eternal light and life in his name (John 20:30-31). Alleluia! Christ is risen! The Lord is risen indeed! Alleluia! Alleluia!"

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses John 20:1-10 as a base but relies heavily on a thematic 'night' motif drawn from the entire Johannine corpus. It fails to identify what is unique to this specific passage that cannot be found elsewhere. It treats the text more as a proof-text for the general doctrine of Resurrection rather than a specific word for the moment.",
      "quotes": [
        "The symbolism of night and darkness pervades the Gospel of John.",
        "The Gospel of John, chapter 20, verse 1: 'On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus on the specific details of the Johannine empty tomb narrative (the running, the specific placement of the napkin) as the primary source of the 'new word' rather than importing a general theology of light and darkness."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates knowledge of the Johannine style ('master dramatist') and Jewish burial customs. There is a clear attempt to explain the historical implausibility of the resurrection in the ancient world, distinguishing it from pagan myths.",
      "quotes": [
        "They bound the body tightly with the spices wrapped in linen bands, 'as is the burial custom of the Jews'",
        "All over the Mediterranean there were dying and rising gods, but none of them were actual historical figures"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exegesis by exploring the specific Greek nuances of the 'seeing and believing' in verse 8, rather than just the dramatic action."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is largely psychological and existential. While it mentions the 'death of a career' or 'health,' it remains within the realm of general human experience rather than concrete contemporary events or the specific 'zeitgeist' Dekker demands. It lacks a sharp edge regarding the hearer's specific world.",
      "quotes": [
        "You will come to know it in a hundred other ways, as the death of a friendship, the death of a career, the loss of youth...",
        "Some visit cemeteries to read the inscriptions and try to imagine the lives of those buried there."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond universal human grief to address how the 'night' is manifesting specifically in the current cultural or political moment of the congregation."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a somewhat linear path: anecdote, biblical survey of 'night', then the specific text, then application. The 'interweaving' is present but the movement is often interrupted by long thematic excursions.",
      "quotes": [
        "This, in part, is what John's Gospel means by night. [Transition to] The Gospel of John, chapter 20, verse 1..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the block-style structure where the text is explained and then applied; try to let the application emerge directly from the unfolding of the text's own logic."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is strong on 'misery' (the reality of death and the 'night'). It moves toward 'redemption' through the Resurrection. However, the 'gratitude' (the life of the believer following the event) is almost entirely absent, ending abruptly at the confession of faith.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is the night in which Sin and Death reign.",
        "The rising sun revealed the victory already accomplished."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Develop the 'gratitude' section: how does the reality of the empty tomb concretely change the 'journey' of the hearer tomorrow?"
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon lacks the 'two ways' in the sense of a serious call to responsibility or the danger of being lost. It presents the Resurrection as a victory to be observed and believed, but the existential 'threat' of remaining in the night is softened into general grief.",
      "quotes": [
        "Do you believe this? Is any of this true?",
        "receive the gift of eternal light and life in his name"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the 'seriousness of choice' by emphasizing the consequence of remaining in the 'night'—the possibility of being 'lost in time' as Dekker describes."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon emphasizes that the Resurrection is God's act, not a human possibility. The use of the 'two natures' is implicit in the discussion of the 'corpse' of the 'Son of God'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Son of God, by his own permission, has been given over to the realm of night.",
        "He arose from the kingdom of Death and carried away its spoils."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'grace' aspect more explicit: that this victory is 'outside ourselves' and not merely a psychological comfort for our losses."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1450 words, the sermon likely clocks in under 15 minutes. According to Dekker, 'depth needs breadth,' and this sermon ends just as it reaches the point of application.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the sermon to at least 20 minutes by deepening the specific exegesis of John 20 and broadening the concrete application to the contemporary world."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's standard primarily due to its brevity and its tendency to favor general thematic truths over the 'specific word' of the pericope. It captures the 'misery' of death effectively but fails to articulate the 'two ways' or the concrete 'gratitude' that follows redemption. The application is more psychological than theological-ethical.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong thematic consistency regarding the 'night' motif in Johannine theology.",
      "Clear Christocentric focus; the resurrection is presented as an objective act of God.",
      "Effective use of the 'misery' category, taking the reality of death seriously."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (under 20 minutes) prevents the necessary 'breadth' for depth.",
      "Lack of the 'two ways'; there is no sense of the urgency of choice or the danger of being lost.",
      "Application is too general/universal and lacks the concrete 'zeitgeist' analysis Dekker requires."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate homiletical reflection, but it is not yet a 'sermon' in the full sense of Dekker's theses. It lacks the specific 'nowhere else' quality of the text and the necessary length to bridge the gap between ancient exegesis and concrete contemporary life."
