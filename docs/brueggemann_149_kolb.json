    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively grounds the biblical narrative in concrete, physical reality. The preacher avoids abstracting the man's disability, instead imagining a specific cause ('caught in a corn-picker'). The connection to the hearer's world is made through the metaphor of 'hidden disabilities' and the physical reality of the city. However, it lacks a singular, immersive 'slice of life' story from the modern day, relying instead on the biblical story to carry the experiential weight.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest phase. The preacher masterfully explores the 'why' behind the conflict, analyzing the sociological and psychological patterns of 'protocols' versus 'human need'. It pauses to look at the silence of the Pharisees and the underlying 'hard-heartedness'. It moves from the text to a sharp cultural critique of racial and economic protocols in the hearer's city.",
      "quotes": [
        "Why is this so? Because they knew better but they could not bring themselves to commit to bodily restoration at the expense of the protocols.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Theological concepts are present but often subservient to the social critique. The 'big idea' is clear: God's messianic restoration prioritizes bodies over protocols. However, the exegesis of the Sabbath is somewhat brief, and the 'messianic juices' metaphor, while evocative, lacks dogmatic precision. The logical connection between the Sabbath healing and the necessity of the execution is well-argued but leans more on social logic than systematic theology.",

It identifies the 'what' (permit restoration) but provides little 'how'. The application remains largely at the level of 'becoming' rather than 'doing'.

It successfully deconstructs the biblical text to reveal a timeless conflict between institutional 'protocols' and human 'bodies', applying this with sharp insight to modern urban stratification. However, it falls short of a complete Kolb cycle due to a lack of concrete Active Experimentation. The preacher acts primarily as an Artist/Poet and Sage, successfully engaging the Diverging and Accommodating learning styles, but provides less for the Converging learner who seeks practical utility. The theological conceptualization is clear but remains secondary to the social-interpretive task.",

      "Use more systematic theological categories to ground the prophetic insights."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a highly effective prophetic address that succeeds in making the biblical text 'strange' and 'urgent' again. It scores high on Reflective Observation and Visionary structure, providing a deep diagnosis of the human and social condition. Its primary weakness from a Kolb perspective is the lack of a robust 'Active Experimentation' phase. While the hearer is moved and enlightened, they are not fully equipped for action. To move from a 6.5 to an 8, the sermon needs to bridge the gap between the 'messianic juices of restoration' and the specific, mundane tasks of the believer's daily life. It is an excellent example of 'priestly listening' and 'prophetic discernment', but requires more 'servant leadership' in its pragmatic application."
