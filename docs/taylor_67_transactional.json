  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is a masterful example of Nurturing Parent homiletics. It provides deep emotional resonance but relies on a 'theology of brokenness' that can be psychologically burdensome. It suggests that human value and 'realness' are only achieved through suffering, which can inadvertently lead listeners to seek out or stay in 'dark nights' to feel spiritually valid. However, the emphasis on the 'Free Child' (singing/joy) provides a healthy emotional outlet.",
    "strengths": [
      "High emotional intelligence regarding the experience of illness.",
      "Strong use of Free Child energy to inspire hope.",
      "Encourages direct, Adult-like communication with God ('arguing', 'pleading')."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Deconstruct the 'suffering = authenticity' binary to avoid shaming those in seasons of joy.",
      "Reduce Critical Parent labels like 'fake' or 'counterfeit' for those seeking comfort."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as Adults who can choose how to integrate suffering, rather than as Children who must be 'chastened' to grow. Shift from 'You must suffer' to 'When we suffer, here is a resource.'"
