    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a solid exegetical framework by situating the text within the Lenten 'Road to Calvary' and the specific geography of Gethsemane. The 'Sache' (theological core) is the suffering of Christ, specifically the emotional laceration of betrayal. However, the factual side remains largely narrative and illustrative rather than dogmatically rigorous. The preacher uses the 'consecrated imagination' of a mentor (Dr. King) to fill in the gaps of the biblical text. While the 'blue' side is clear and comprehensible, it borders on the anecdotal. The Barthian requirement of Christ as the 'Acting Subject' is met, but the factual depth is sacrificed for emotional resonance and moral application.",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as a 'student' of the tradition, deeply influenced by his mentors and his own racial/social context. There is a transparent vulnerability when he speaks of his grief regarding 'young black men and women.' The 'I' is largely diaconal, serving to bridge the ancient text with contemporary struggle. However, there is a slight 'hysterical' tendency in the sense of seeking emotional impact through dramatic storytelling and the use of 'consecrated imagination.' The preacher's faith is presented as one that is both intellectually formed in the seminary and emotionally rooted in the Black church tradition.",
      "quotes": [
        "I was still a student when I heard a sermon...",
        "I weep at seeing young black men and women throwing their lives away...",
        "I have never known a parent to name a child 'Judas'."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive/Hysterical mix. The preacher seeks harmony and closeness (Depressive) through shared grief and 'friendship' with Jesus, while using dramatic, expressive rhetoric (Hysterical) to move the audience.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' serves the text by providing a contemporary mirror for the ancient betrayal, though the personal digression on social issues briefly shifts the focus from the text to the preacher's social observation.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher-Student' and 'Solidary Sinner.' The preacher uses 'we' and 'you and me' to include himself in the guilt of betrayal. However, there is a paternalistic shift during the digression about young black men, where the preacher speaks 'about' a group rather than 'to' them from a position of shared weakness. The 'yellow' signals are generally warm but carry a heavy weight of expectation. The use of 'Friend' at the end attempts to restore a relationship of grace, but the preceding sections on 'awful responsibility' create a hierarchical pressure.",
      "quotes": [
        "I want you to look at how I am going to deal with...",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavy on 'Anspruch' (Demand). The appeal is to 'pluck out' the bitter weed of sin and to recognize one's own betrayal. The theological 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is present but primarily appears at the very end. The preacher uses the 'Appeal Ear' of the congregation to drive behavioral change ('straighten it out now'). While the Gospel is framed as the 'friendship of Jesus,' it is used here as a tool to highlight the shame of the hearer's betrayal. The ratio of Law to Gospel leans heavily toward Law (guilt/responsibility) until the final paragraph.",
      "quotes": [
        "Beg the Lord to help you pluck it out now.",
        "If you are lying, or cheating, or stealing, straighten it out now.",
        "How often have we his people bruised and wounded him anew?"

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Anspruch-dominant. The promise of Christ's friendship is used as a foil to emphasize the horror of human failure.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Moderate to High. The call to 'straighten it out' suggests a self-driven moral correction rather than a purely Spirit-led transformation.",
      "strengths": [
        "Urgency in the call to repentance.",
        "Direct application to daily life (lying, cheating)."

    "disruptions": "The social digression creates a 'thematic noise' that disrupts the flow from Gethsemane to the heart of the listener.",
    "healing_disruption": "The 'Friend' appeal at the end serves as a healing disruption, breaking the tension of guilt with the persistence of divine love."

  "reception_simulation": {
    "the_factual_ear_hears": "Jesus was betrayed by Judas in Gethsemane; betrayal is a process of gradual corruption; privilege increases responsibility.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a powerful example of the Black Homiletic tradition, utilizing narrative, pathos, and social relevance. From a Schulz von Thun perspective, it is highly effective in its 'Green' (Self-revelation) and 'Red' (Appeal) dimensions, creating a strong sense of urgency and personal connection. Theologically, it follows a Barthian emphasis on the 'Road to Calvary' as God's movement toward man, but it risks slipping into psychologization by focusing heavily on the 'hurt' and 'bruised' feelings of Jesus. The 'Yellow' (Relational) side is complicated by a paternalistic tone during the social critique, which may alienate some hearers. The 'Blue' (Factual) side is sufficient but relies more on illustrative 'imagination' than rigorous exegesis. The sermon successfully moves the listener to a place of self-reflection, though the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is somewhat abbreviated in favor of a call to moral reform.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a risk of 'humanizing' the revelation too much by focusing on Jesus's 'bruised soul' as a psychological state rather than a theological necessity of the Atonement.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Vivid, evocative imagery.",
      "Strong integration of personal and communal identity.",
      "Effective use of the 'Friend' motif to bridge Law and Gospel."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Balance the moral demand with a deeper exposition of grace.",
      "Refine social critiques to ensure they remain 'at eye level' with the congregation.",
      "Strengthen the dogmatic 'Blue' side to support the emotional 'Green' side."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively strong and emotionally resonant sermon that effectively uses the Lenten narrative to provoke self-examination, though it leans slightly too hard on moral appeal over theological promise."
