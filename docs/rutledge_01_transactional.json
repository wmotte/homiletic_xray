    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an excellent example of psychologically healthy homiletics. By operating primarily from the Adult ego state, the preacher respects the intellectual and emotional autonomy of the listeners. Instead of using shame (Critical Parent) to enforce belief in the Second Coming, the preacher uses reality-testing (Adult) to acknowledge the difficulty of belief in a scientific age. The use of historical examples (Dred Scott, the Menorah story) serves as 'Adult' data that invites the 'Free Child' to hope, rather than the 'Adapted Child' to fear. The sermon successfully navigates the tension between divine sovereignty and human agency without falling into the 'Rescuer' trap of the Drama Triangle.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from 'modern skepticism' to 'trusting the apostolic witnesses' is a bit rapid; more Adult processing on *why* those witnesses are trustworthy today could strengthen it."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' instead of 'you' when discussing spiritual struggles. This maintains the horizontal transaction and prevents the 'Parent' position from taking over."
