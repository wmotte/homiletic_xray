    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The factual side is built on a comparison between modern influencers and the Pharisees. The preacher explains the 'straining of the gnat' (mug uitziften) and the 'swallowing of the camel' (kameel doorslikken) as a metaphor for legalism versus the heart's intent. While the exegetical core is present, it remains somewhat superficial. The preacher correctly identifies the 'Sache' as the internal renewal through Christ, but the dogmatic depth regarding the 'Law' is simplified to 'outward rules.' The historical context of the Pharisees is used as a moral foil rather than a complex theological reality. The transition from the 'blue' facts of the text to the 'red' appeal happens very quickly, leaving little room for a deep Barthian reflection on the 'Otherness' of God's Word.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as a solidary figure, attempting to bridge the gap between the pulpit and the youth. There is a conscious effort to be 'real' by mentioning his own appearance and the symbolic 'stained shirt.' However, there is a slight 'compulsive' tendency (Riemann) in the way he emphasizes the need for confession and the correct order of inner-to-outer change. The 'I' is largely diaconal, serving the message of grace, but there is a hint of 'image management' in the way he presents his own 'neatness' before showing the 'stains.' The vulnerability feels slightly staged/pedagogical rather than rawly existential.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'teaching-solidary.' The preacher speaks 'at eye level' by using the 'we' form frequently. However, there is a paternalistic undertone in the 'Appeal Ear' triggers—he tells the youth what they feel (overwhelmed by influencers) and what they need. The 'yellow' signal is warm but slightly intrusive, assuming he knows the inner state of the congregation ('Herken je dat?'). The relationship noise is low, but the constant questioning can feel like a rhetorical 'squeeze' rather than an open invitation.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily appeal-oriented, but it successfully anchors the 'Anspruch' (demand) in the 'Zuspruch' (promise). The preacher moves from the 'Law' of influencers (perfection) to the 'Gospel' of Jesus (acceptance). The central appeal is to 'come to Jesus' and 'confess to one another.' While there is a risk of making 'confession' a new law, the preacher emphasizes that it is a response to unconditional love. The theological weight of the 'Red' side is balanced by the blood of Christ (Golgotha), preventing it from becoming pure moralism.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a solid, communicative sermon that effectively uses the Four-Sides-Model to reach a specific target group (youth). The preacher successfully identifies a modern 'Law' (the influencer culture) and contrasts it with the 'Gospel' (Christ's acceptance). Theologically, it follows the line of Gerrit Immink by emphasizing the encounter with the living Christ as the source of change. However, from a Barthian perspective, there is a slight over-psychologization: the 'inner life' and 'feelings' of the hearer are the primary stage, sometimes overshadowing the objective 'extra nos' of the Word. The 'Green' side (self-revelation) is used pedagogically, which is effective but lacks the raw 'Selbstenthüllung' that makes a sermon truly prophetic. The 'Red' side is dominant but remains grounded in grace. The sermon is 'satisfactory to good' because it maintains congruence and delivers a clear, Christ-centered promise without falling into pure moralism, though it lacks intellectual and exegetical depth.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon risks turning God into a 'therapist' for the inner life rather than the Sovereign Lord who disrupts all human categories.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Excellent use of a contemporary metaphor (Influencers).",
      "Strong integration of a visual aid (the stained shirt).",
      "Clear focus on the 'Zuspruch' of the Gospel."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Deepen the exegetical 'Blue' side to avoid a 'caricature' of the Pharisees.",
      "Reduce the frequency of rhetorical 'confirmation' questions.",
      "Allow for more theological 'mystery' beyond the 'inner/outer' dichotomy."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively effective sermon that serves the congregation well, though it stays within safe, predictable homiletical boundaries."
