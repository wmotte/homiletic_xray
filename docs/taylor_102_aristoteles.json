    "logos": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The rational architecture is present but underdeveloped due to the brevity of the text. The preacher establishes a logical link between the 'likeness of death' in Romans and the 'suffering servant' in Isaiah. The argument follows a deductive path: defining a theological concept (the likeness of death), illustrating it through prophetic poetry, and concluding with a thematic summary (moral integrity). However, the transition between the 'refusal to rely on earthly weapons' and the 'moral integrity of the universe' lacks a clear logical bridge. The jump from the historical/prophetic description of suffering to a philosophical conclusion about universal integrity is abrupt and requires more argumentative scaffolding to be fully traceable for a listener.",
      "quotes": [
        "In one startling sentence that reverses the verdict of the world, this believer declared, 'If we have been planted together in the likeness of his death...'",
        "The 'death like his' represents, surely, Christ's refusal to rely on any earthly weapon; the apparent shame and disgrace with which his career ended.",

      "specific_diagnosis": "The Logos is structurally sound in its use of scripture but lacks the connective tissue to explain its philosophical conclusions."
    },
    "pathos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The emotional resonance is primarily derived from the evocative language of the quoted scripture rather than the preacher's own prose. The use of Isaiah 53 introduces a tone of solemnity, grief, and 'stark shame.' The preacher successfully taps into the 'haunting' nature of the crucifixion, using sensory-laden words like 'bruise,' 'slaughter,' and 'dry ground.' However, the Pathos remains somewhat distant and academic; it describes the emotions of the biblical narrative without directly bridging them to the current existential reality of the congregation. The affective power is high in the middle section but cools significantly in the more abstract conclusion.",
      "emotional_tone": "Solemn, reflective, and somber.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is a summation of the central commitment of the life of Jesus which has thrilled and haunted twenty centuries.",
        "He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.",
        "Thus the poetry of Calvary's stark shame and fatal bruise."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Selection of highly evocative, emotionally charged scripture.",
        "Use of strong adjectives such as 'startling,' 'haunted,' and 'stark'.",

        "Balance the somber tone of death with the promised 'likeness of resurrection' to provide emotional relief."

      "specific_diagnosis": "Pathos is reliant on the biblical text's inherent power rather than homiletical application."
    },
    "ethos": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The Ethos of the preacher is that of a distant commentator or a theological lecturer. There is very little personal vulnerability or evidence of the 'witness' role. The preacher speaks about 'the writer of Romans' and 'this believer,' creating a secondary layer of distance between the speaker, the text, and the audience. There is no 'I' or 'we' that feels inclusive of the preacher’s own struggle with the 'stark shame' of the cross. While the preacher displays intellectual authority and respect for the text, the lack of personal involvement makes the message feel like a detached observation rather than a lived conviction.",
      "authenticity": "Low; the preacher remains behind a veil of academic and third-person language.",
      "quotes": [
        "The writer of Romans set down in brief compass the faith of true Christians...",
        "That unknown lyricist whom we call the Second Isaiah... was true to the spirit of Christ.",

        "Incorporate personal testimony or a collective 'we' that includes the preacher in the need for moral integrity.",

        "Acknowledge the difficulty of choosing the 'likeness of death' in a modern context."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The preacher is an observer of the faith rather than a participant in it, undermining personal credibility."

    "dominant_mode": "Pathos",
    "suppressed_mode": "Ethos",
    "balance_score": 5,
    "analysis": "The sermon fragment is heavily weighted toward the Pathos of the biblical narrative, specifically the suffering servant imagery. This creates a somber atmosphere. The Logos provides a basic frame, but the Ethos is almost entirely absent. The result is a message that feels like a dramatic reading of scripture with a brief philosophical commentary attached. The three modes do not reinforce each other; instead, the Pathos of the scripture carries the weight that the preacher's Logos and Ethos fail to support.",
    "consequences_of_imbalance": [
      "The hearer may feel the weight of the crucifixion but not the call to personal change.",
      "The lack of Ethos makes the message feel like a lecture on ancient literature rather than a life-changing word.",
      "Intellectual hearers may find the conclusion about 'moral integrity' logically disconnected from the preceding suffering."
    ],
    "recommendation_for_balance": "The preacher must insert themselves into the narrative. By moving from 'The writer of Romans says' to 'We find ourselves in...', the Ethos would rise and create a better balance with the existing Pathos."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_rhetorical_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon fragment 'Commitment To Moral Integrity' is a sober, intellectually respectable meditation on the nature of Christ's suffering and its implications for faith. It excels in its selection of biblical imagery, particularly the use of Isaiah 53 to illuminate Romans 6. However, it suffers from a significant lack of Ethos; the preacher functions as a distant narrator rather than a credible witness. The language is elevated and dignified, but this creates a 'glass wall' between the pulpit and the pew. The logical transition from the historical suffering of Jesus to the philosophical concept of 'moral integrity' is the weakest point of the Logos, as it feels like a modern abstraction imposed upon a raw, ancient narrative. Without a stronger personal presence or a more direct application to the lives of the listeners, the sermon remains a cognitive exercise rather than a transformative event.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Effective use of the 'Suffering Servant' motif to explain the 'likeness of death'.",
      "Dignified and serious rhetorical tone.",
      "Strong opening that immediately identifies a central theological paradox."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase personal vulnerability and the 'witness' role (Ethos).",
      "Clarify the logical link between non-violence and 'moral integrity' (Logos).",
      "Translate the 'poetry of Calvary' into the 'prose of daily life' for the hearer (Pathos)."
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Rational-Declarative with borrowed Pathos.",
    "audience_analysis": "Theologically literate or traditional hearers who appreciate a high liturgical tone and scriptural depth, but who may not expect personal engagement.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Use 'we' and 'I' more frequently to bridge the gap between text and life.",
      "Define abstract terms like 'moral integrity' with concrete, modern examples.",
      "Explicitly connect the 'resurrection' mentioned in the opening to the 'integrity' mentioned in the closing."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a competent but distant theological reflection. It meets the basic requirements of homiletical structure but fails to achieve the 'Optimal Balance' of the Rhetorical Triangle. Its primary failure is the suppression of Ethos, which leaves the message feeling academic. To move from a score of 5 to a 7 or 8, the preacher must step out from behind the biblical citations and speak as one who is also 'planted in the likeness of his death.'"
