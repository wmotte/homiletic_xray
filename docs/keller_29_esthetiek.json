    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily as a diagnostic tool rather than a poetic landscape. While it lacks the 'painting' of biblical scenes found in Wilson’s 'Four Pages', it effectively uses modern cultural images (Google searches, retail stores, fitness centers) to ground abstract concepts. The imagery of the 'crouching animal' from Genesis 4 is a strong moment of biblical visualization. However, the preacher often explains the image rather than letting it speak for itself. The 'sword and hilt' metaphor is the most aesthetically potent image, providing a tactile sense of vulnerability and surrender. Overall, the imagery is functional and illustrative rather than immersive or sensory-rich.",
      "quotes": [
        "God is likening sin to a predatory animal who crouches down to hide but is ready to come and spring and destroy your power.",
        "When someone come up, takes out the sword, and hands the sword to someone with the hilt toward the person, what you’re saying is, 'Command me.'",

        "Use more evocative language to describe the 'harmful spirit' to create atmospheric depth."

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Leans heavily toward 'telling'. The preacher uses images to explain points rather than creating a cinematic experience where the hearer discovers the truth."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in 'stewardship of language' as defined by McEntyre. There is a visible effort to define terms precisely (e.g., the distinction between 'evil' and 'terrifying' for the Hebrew word for harmful). The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by translating theological concepts into psychological and sociological categories (comparison, desire, resentment). The language is economical and avoids unnecessary ornamentation, reflecting a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic. The use of the term 'hunger for enhancement' to describe a distorted form of love shows a high degree of linguistic precision and nuance.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Hebrew word that is translated harmful here is a hard word to translate. It doesn’t mean evil. It doesn’t mean wicked. It actually means terrifying.",
        "I have to say much of what we in our culture call feelings of love is really a hunger for enhancement.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "Some repetitive phrasing ('It’s a lot bigger problem than we think') could be tightened.",
        "The transition between points is very explicit ('Firstly', 'Secondly'), which is clear but lacks literary elegance.",
        "Occasional use of 'this, that, and the other' feels slightly informal compared to the otherwise precise tone."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Exemplary. Theological terms like 'anointed' or 'salvation' are contextualized within the narrative of David or the psychological experience of the hearer."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The rhythm is that of a teacher or a conversationalist rather than a poet. There is a clear 'oral' quality—short sentences, rhetorical questions, and direct address—which prevents it from being 'paper language'. However, it lacks the cadence, alliteration, or parallelism that would give it musicality. The structure is staccato and analytical. While this aids comprehension, it does not provide the 'aesthetic rest' or emotional swelling often found in more liturgical or poetic preaching. The flow is logical rather than lyrical.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 6.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' that prioritizes clarity and psychological precision over poetic flourish. It functions as an effective instrument of 'stewardship,' stripping away jargon to reveal the core of the human condition. While it lacks sensory richness and musical cadence, its strength lies in its diagnostic sharpness. It is the language of a 'witness' (Long) and a 'physician of the soul,' using words to dissect the heart with surgical accuracy. The aesthetic is one of transparency—the language does not draw attention to itself but to the reality it describes."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Lowry-esque' plot: it begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' by identifying envy as a hidden, destructive force. It builds tension by showing the 'predatory' nature of sin (the 'crouching' animal). The turning point is the shift from Saul (the anti-model) to Jonathan (the model), and finally to Jesus (the archetype). The movement from the 'misery' of envy to the 'freedom' of abdication provides a satisfying resolution. However, the three-point structure is quite visible, which occasionally makes the journey feel more like a guided tour than a dramatic discovery.",
      "quotes": [
        "Saul’s life is being destroyed by envy... It’s a lot bigger of a problem than we think it is.",
        "Did I make you feel bad enough yet about your envy? Okay. That’s my job. Now I want to make you feel better.",
        "Do you know how free it is to finally lay down the kingship of your own life?"

      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey that utilizes a three-point structure as its roadmap. It is a 'homiletical plot' disguised as an outline."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. It achieves 'reframing' (Cilliers) by placing the ancient story of Saul and Jonathan against the backdrop of modern capitalism, journalism, and psychology. The preacher respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the harmful spirit from God) while making it profoundly relevant to a 21st-century hearer. The synthesis of Aristotle, C.S. Lewis, and the biblical narrative creates a rich, polyphonic conversation. The reframing of 'love' as 'putting your happiness in someone else's happiness' offers a new lens through which the hearer can view their relationships.",
      "quotes": [
        "We live in a capitalistic society where envy is basically seen as a kind of innocuous way to sell things.",
        "In the ancient Near East, if you were the heir to the throne... you don't put your sword in their hand. You put your sword in their belly.",
        "Jesus is also the true Jonathan... He was putting his sword in the hands of the human race, and we killed him with it."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant integration of secular insights (Aristotle, media studies) with biblical theology.",
        "Successful 'reframing' of the biblical characters as archetypes of universal human struggles.",
        "The connection between Jonathan's abdication and the hearer's need to 'get off the throne' is seamless."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could explore the 'liturgical' context of the women's song (v. 7) more deeply as a trigger for modern social media comparison.",
        "The transition to the C.S. Lewis quote at the end is effective but slightly abrupt.",
        "Provide more 'contextual' detail about the Davidic kingship to ground the 'reframing' in history."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes. It reframes envy not as a minor flaw but as a 'predatory animal' and a 'brain tumor,' and reframes the gospel as the 'radical unenviousness of God.'"
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward a 'closed' work of art. While it is intellectually stimulating, it provides very specific answers and a clear 'moral of the story.' The preacher acts as an authoritative guide, leading the hearer to a predetermined conclusion. However, the 'openness' (Stark) resides in the psychological depth; the hearer is left to examine their own 'itching feeling of inferiority.' The final question ('Who do you think is going to get the better end of that deal?') invites the hearer into the mystery of grace, but the path there is tightly controlled.",
      "quotes": [
        "What envy is. There are three parts to envy. You have to understand all three...",
        "The way to do that is not to look at Saul... let’s look at Jonathan.",
        "Who do you think is going to get the better end of that deal?"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The final question leaves the hearer with a lingering choice rather than a command.",
        "The psychological analysis invites self-reflection, which is a form of 'appropriation'.",
        "The complexity of the 'harmful spirit' is left somewhat mysterious, respecting the text's depth."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Allow for more 'ambivalence'—acknowledge that even for the believer, envy remains a persistent struggle.",
        "Reduce the 'didactic' tone to allow the hearer more space to discover the 'Jonathan-Jesus' connection themselves.",
        "End with an image or a story that lingers rather than a logical 'deal' to be evaluated."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent. It is a 'closed' system of theological and psychological truth that aims for a specific 'event' of conviction and grace."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is high, driven by a compelling narrative arc and masterful integration of text and context. The sermon functions as a 'dramaturgy of the soul,' moving the hearer from the claustrophobia of envy to the open space of grace. While the structure is somewhat rigid and didactic, it successfully 'reframes' reality, forcing the hearer to look at their own life through the lens of the Davidic narrative. It is a performance of 'persuasion' that respects the hearer's intellect while leading them toward a clear Christological climax."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'cheap comfort' by comparing envy to a brain tumor and a predatory animal. It does not offer a 'happy ending' based on human effort, but rather on the 'radical vulnerability' of God. The preacher avoids sentimental language about 'Jesus loving you' and instead uses the gritty imagery of a sword being handed to an enemy. The analysis of envy is 'authentic' (Cilliers) because it takes the 'pain of the human condition' seriously before moving to grace.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential for kitsch in the 'love' section is avoided by defining love as 'putting happiness in another's flourishing' rather than a vague feeling.",
      "The 'I Envy You' website anecdote could have been kitschy, but is used as a dark diagnostic of self-harm."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission that 'almost never does somebody come to me and say, I have a problem with envy.'",
      "The description of Jesus becoming 'killable'—a stark, anti-kitsch term for the Incarnation."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Continue to use 'hard' words like 'killable' and 'vulnerable' to describe grace, as they prevent the gospel from becoming a sentimental cliché."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully opens a 'space for grace' (Cilliers) by deconstructing the 'throne' of the self. By showing that envy is rooted in a 'smarting, writhing awareness of inferiority,' the preacher creates a void that only the 'radical unenviousness' of Christ can fill. Space is opened when the preacher moves from 'what we must do' to 'what Jesus has done.' However, the highly analytical structure occasionally 'fills' the space with information, leaving less room for the 'mystery' of the Spirit's work.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between Saul’s madness and David’s success is well-sustained, as is the tension between our desire for 'enhancement' and true love.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'harmful spirit from God' is acknowledged as 'enigmatic,' respecting the mystery of divine judgment.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. While there is a call to 'abdicate,' it is presented as a response to the beauty of Christ's own abdication, not a moralistic duty.",
    "recommendation": "Incorporate a moment of liturgical silence or a more 'poetic' conclusion to allow the 'space' for grace to be felt emotionally as well as understood intellectually."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of the 'Sober-Reformed' style, characterized by intellectual precision, psychological depth, and Christocentric reframing. Its beauty lies not in its 'decoration' but in its 'transparency'—the way it uses language as a sharp tool to reveal the hidden dynamics of the heart. The preacher avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by refusing to offer easy solutions, instead leading the hearer through a rigorous 'anatomy' of sin toward the 'radical vulnerability' of the Cross. While the structure is didactic and the language is more analytical than poetic, the sermon achieves a powerful 'event' (Immink) of conviction and hope. It successfully 'reframes' the ancient text for a modern audience, making the story of Saul and Jonathan a mirror for the contemporary soul. The aesthetic experience is one of 'clarity' and 'relief'—the relief of being truly known and yet truly loved by a God who 'does not begrudge his own precious blood.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of ancient biblical narratives within modern psychological and cultural contexts.",
      "Linguistic precision and 'stewardship of language' that avoids clichés and jargon.",
      "A clear, compelling narrative arc that moves from diagnostic 'misery' to Christological 'grace'."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase sensory imagery ('showing') to balance the high level of analytical 'telling'.",
      "Soften the didactic scaffolding to allow for a more organic, 'open' aesthetic experience.",
      "Incorporate more musicality and rhythm into the sentence structure to enhance the oral impact."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Analytical-Reframing (Sober-Reformed)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Witness' model of Thomas Long, with the 'Stewardship of Language' of McEntyre.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to urban, educated, and skeptical hearers who value intellectual honesty, psychological insight, and a lack of sentimentalism.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a 'cinematic' opening that describes the atmosphere of Saul's court without immediate explanation.",
      "Use more 'legato' phrasing in the section on God's love to create an aesthetic shift from the 'staccato' diagnosis.",
      "Allow a biblical metaphor (like the 'crouching animal') to carry the weight of a whole section without over-explaining it."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically effective 'open work' in its psychological application, though 'closed' in its theological delivery. It excels in 'Space for Grace' by moving beyond moralism to the beauty of Christ's character. It is a model of how 'sober' language can achieve profound aesthetic depth through truth-telling and precision. While it lacks the 'visual excess' of some traditions, its 'aesthetic of simplicity' is perfectly suited to its context and purpose."
