    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The factual level is dominated by ecclesiastical-political analysis rather than classical exegesis. The 'Sache' (the living Christ) is identified with the 'marginalized' and the 'suffering'. While the preacher references Ezekiel 37 and 1 Thessalonians, these serve more as a framework for a sociological critique of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. The theological depth lies in the 'Theology of Liberation' paradigm. However, the 'blue' side suffers from a lack of nuance regarding the 'other side' (the institution), presenting a binary world-view. For a congregation, the abstraction level is high, assuming significant knowledge of church politics (Opus Dei, Boff, Curia).",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher is highly transparent. The 'I' is not hidden; it is an 'I' of holy indignation ('Was mich empört'). There is no image management; the preacher reveals a deep, almost physical pain over the state of the church. The authenticity is high, but it borders on the 'prophetic ego' where the personal conviction is equated with the divine 'Ruach'. The self-revelation is 'diaconal' in the sense that it serves the cause of the poor, but it is also highly subjective.",
      "quotes": [
        "Was mich am meisten... empört...",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship to the direct audience is secondary to the relationship with the 'enemy' (Rome). The preacher speaks 'from the margins' but with a high moral authority. The 'We' is defined as the 'community of the marginalized' or 'critical Christians'. There is a risk of 'relationship noise' for any listener who does not fully share the preacher's radicality; they might feel excluded or pressured into a specific political camp. The tone is confrontational ('Why do you want to die?').",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward 'Anspruch' (Demand/Law). The appeal is to wake up, to resist, and to change the system. While the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) appears at the very end with the vision of the dry bones, the bulk of the sermon functions as a 'Law' that exposes the sins of the church. In a Barthian sense, the 'Gift' (Grace) is almost entirely dependent on the 'Action' (Reformation). The pressure on the listener to be 'spiritually awake' and 'politically active' is immense.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6,
    "summary": "This is a powerful, polemic manifesto that functions as a 'prophetic' cry. From a Schulz von Thun perspective, it is a 'Red/Green' sermon: high on appeal and self-revelation, but struggling with the 'Blue' (theological depth beyond politics) and 'Yellow' (pastoral relationship). Theologically, it follows the tradition of 'Political Theology'. However, it risks 'psychologizing' the Spirit by equating the 'Ruach' almost exclusively with democratic processes and liberation movements. The Barthian warning is relevant here: God is in danger of becoming an instrument for human church reform. The 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is present but feels like a late addition to a primarily 'Law-driven' (Anspruch) text. It is a 'Satisfactory' sermon because it achieves its goal of provocation, but it lacks the 'Good' score due to its theological one-sidedness and potential to overwhelm the listener with moral/political demands.",
    "barthian_warning": "High risk of 'horizontalism'. God's action is largely identified with human political and ecclesiastical 'reawakening'.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Uncompromising authenticity.",
      "Sharp analysis of power structures.",
      "Strong use of contemporary 'saints' as examples."

    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Increase the 'Zuspruch' (Gospel/Promise) throughout the text.",
      "Differentiate between the 'institution' and the 'people' to reduce relationship noise.",
      "Ground the critique more deeply in the 'freedom of a Christian' rather than just 'democratic principles'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A rhetorically brilliant but theologically imbalanced 'Law-sermon' that serves more as a call to arms than a meal for the soul."
