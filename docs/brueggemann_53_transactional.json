  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It avoids the common 'Critical Parent' trap of religious discourse. By framing the encounter as a therapeutic dialogue and using modern archetypes, the preacher engages the listener's Adult ego. The focus on 'vulnerability' and 'innocence' encourages the Free Child, while the lack of dogmatic 'musts' prevents the activation of the Adapted Child. It promotes autonomy by leaving the listener in a state of 'wonder' rather than forced closure.",
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of Adult-to-Adult communication.",
      "Validates the listener's internal experience ('the gnaw').",
      "Avoids the Drama Triangle by not positioning the preacher as a Rescuer."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'You've got to' section (Jesus' voice) is repetitive; while narratively justified, it briefly flirts with a Critical Parent tone."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' and 'us' when describing the process of wondering. This maintains the peer-level Adult transaction and prevents the preacher from accidentally slipping into a 'Rescuer' role."
