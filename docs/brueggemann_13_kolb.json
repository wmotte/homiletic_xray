And if you are alive, you had better scramble and get it all, because that’s all there is [...] It is the same one who used to sit disabled. It could be us!",

  "kolb_phases_analysis": {
    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a broad description of the human condition rather than a specific, localized story. While it uses recognizable categories (homelessness, number one, dead/alive), these are treated more as archetypes than as a 'slice of life' that evokes immediate sensory empathy. The identification with the 'lame man' in the text provides the strongest concrete anchor, but the preacher moves quickly into the meaning of the event rather than lingering in the experience of the disability itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you are homeless, you will be that way forever.",
        "We are threatened, because we do not want our tea party upset.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "Include a specific, modern-day narrative at the start to ground the 'frozen' feeling in a tangible experience.",
        "Describe the sensory details of the temple gate or the lame man's daily reality to deepen emotional immersion."
      ],
      "homiletical_manifestations": "Manifests through the 'hook' of the frozen world and the narrative retelling of the Acts 3 healing."
    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest phase. The preacher excels at analyzing the 'why' behind human and systemic resistance to change. He identifies 'annoyance' and 'complacency' as psychological and social defense mechanisms. He explores the problem of the 'status quo' from multiple perspectives—the authorities, the crowds, and the modern hearer—pausing to reflect on why newness is perceived as a threat.",
      "quotes": [
        "The reason they were annoyed is that the news of resurrection is unsettling. It shatters all our categories.",
        "In our annoyance, when we love the old deathly ways, we frontally deny Easter."

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon offers a clear 'big idea': God's power is a 'dangerous restlessness' that violates human categories. The exegesis of Acts is solid, tracing the movement from healing to trial. However, the theological formulation remains somewhat poetic and metaphorical ('surging power') rather than dogmatically precise. It prioritizes the 'logic of the narrative' over systematic theological categories.",
      "quotes": [
        "The God of the Bible is an inscrutable power for life released in the world.",
        "The resurrection is not just about a dead man come back to life. It is about power at work that we cannot control."

        "Logical progression from the biblical event to its universal theological implications."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Define 'resurrection' more clearly in relation to Christology to ground the 'surging power' in the person of Jesus.",
        "Explain the 'Name of Jesus' (Acts 4:10) with more theological depth rather than treating it as a synonym for 'power'."

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is high on vision but lower on concrete experimentation. While it mentions 'families getting past old quarrels' and 'nations turning swords to plowshares,' these remain broad ethical categories rather than specific action steps. The call is more to a 'change of heart' or 'permitting a new horizon' than to a specific 'doing'. The hearer is invited to 'be on the side of newness,' but the 'how' is left largely to the imagination.",
      "quotes": [
        "Rather the question is whether you can permit in your horizon new healing power...",
        "You can be on the side of the newness that God is now working."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Connects the resurrection to public spheres like economics and politics.",
        "Strong call to reject 'old loyalties' and 'old identities'."

        "Provide one or two very specific 'active experiments' for the coming week (e.g., a specific conversation to unfreeze a quarrel).",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of prophetic-visionary preaching that excels in Reflective Observation and Abstract Conceptualization. It provides a profound diagnosis of the human tendency to 'freeze' reality and offers a compelling theological alternative in the 'restless power' of God. However, it falls short of completing the Kolb cycle due to a lack of concrete Active Experimentation. The application remains at the level of 'perspective' and 'horizon' rather than specific ethical or practical action. While the narrative of the lame man provides a concrete anchor, the sermon quickly moves into the meaning of the event, potentially leaving the 'Accommodating' and 'Converging' learners without a clear path forward. The language is evocative and the logic is sound, but the transition from 'vision' to 'practice' is underdeveloped.",

      "Experiment with a more inductive structure that leads to the 'Big Idea' through a series of practical observations."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a rhetorically effective and theologically deep piece of homiletic work. It succeeds in shifting the hearer's perspective from a 'frozen' world to a 'resurrection' world. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon—strong on reflection and conceptualization but weak on application. To move from a score of 6.5 to an 8, the preacher needs to bridge the gap between the 'surging power' of God and the 'daily practice' of the believer. The priority for improvement is the Pragmatic task: converting the brilliant interpretive insights into concrete handles for the congregation's life."
