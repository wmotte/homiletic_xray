    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon employs strong, evocative imagery that bridges the gap between abstract theology and sensory reality. Sölle uses the 'prophetic voice' and 'mystic voice' as auditory metaphors to structure the text. She successfully 'paints' the biblical scene of the fig tree and uses the metaphor of 'dwelling' (wohnen/Heimat) to describe the relationship with God. The imagery of 'God's hands' and 'God's ears' provides a concrete, somatic dimension to the divine-human relationship. However, some metaphors lean toward the conceptual (e.g., 'market dominance') rather than the purely sensory, though they remain effective for her specific audience.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Sölle demonstrates exceptional stewardship of language. She avoids 'Canaanite' jargon, instead re-occupying traditional terms like 'Gerechtigkeit' (justice) and 'offenbar' (manifest/public) with fresh, provocative meaning. Her precision is evident in the distinction between 'fairness' and 'justice', and her critique of 'religious kitsch' (though she uses the term 'Süße' following Meister Eckhart). Every word feels intentional, aiming to dismantle the privatization of religion. The language is clear, economical, and intellectually rigorous without being academic.",
      "quotes": [
        "den alten umfassenden Begriff Gerechtigkeit durch »fairness« zu ersetzen, eine Art großzügiger Herablassung",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a rhythmic, almost liturgical quality. Sölle uses repetition ('noch nicht', 'bleiben') as a rhythmic anchor. The sentence structure varies effectively between short, punchy rhetorical questions and longer, flowing meditative passages. The inclusion of Tersteegen’s poetry provides a musical peak that shifts the cadence of the prose. The text is clearly written for the ear, with a natural flow that suggests a seasoned orator who understands the power of the pause and the refrain.",
      "quotes": [
        "Was für eine Beschwörung, welch ein Herbeirufen ist doch dieses »noch nicht«!",
        "Ich in dir, du in mir, lass mich ganz verschwinden, dich nur sehn und finden.",

        "Excellent use of the 'noch nicht' refrain to build tension.",
        "Effective variation in sentence length to mirror the 'prophetic' vs 'mystic' voices.",
        "The text has a palpable 'breath' and oral cadence."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The middle section on the 'new millennium' becomes slightly more 'paper-heavy' and loses some rhythmic drive.",

        "Some rhetorical questions are stacked too closely, risking a staccato effect."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Strong oral language; the text breathes and invites spoken performance."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' that avoids sentimentality while maintaining high poetic and rhetorical standards. Sölle’s stewardship of language is evident in her refusal to use religious platitudes, opting instead for precise, often provocative redefinitions. The imagery is somatic and grounded, and the rhythm is dictated by the dialectic between prophetic urgency and mystical stillness. It is a text that demands to be heard, not just read, utilizing the 'musicality of the Word' to bridge the gap between the political and the spiritual."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' by introducing the 'not yet' and the tension between our current identity and our future promise. The conflict is the discrepancy between being 'children of God' and being 'destroyers of the earth'. The movement progresses from the prophetic (external/future) to the mystic (internal/present), reaching a synthesis where both are required. The conclusion returns to the opening 'not yet', but now enriched by the 'already' of the mystic dwelling.",
      "quotes": [
        "Mir ist schon der allzu vollmundige Anfang »jetzt schon sind wir Kinder Gottes« nicht ganz geheuer.",
        "Und das führt uns in die Tiefe unseres Textes, der beide Sprachen... braucht.",
        "Lasst uns doch versuchen, vor jedes Nicht... ein »noch nicht« zu setzen!"

        "Clear movement from the 'external' (Bloch/Marxism) to the 'internal' (Mysticism).",
        "The conclusion effectively loops back to the beginning, providing a sense of closure without being 'closed'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition to the 'year 1989' feels slightly like a detour that breaks the narrative flow.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. Sölle 'reframes' (Cilliers) the biblical text through the lens of Ernst Bloch and the post-1989 global reality. She respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the 'not yet') while making it urgently relevant to contemporary issues like child labor and neoliberalism. The integration is not forced; the text and context illuminate each other. She avoids the 'springboard' trap by staying deeply engaged with the Johannine concepts of 'remaining' and 'seeing'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Dort besuchte ich ihn [Bloch] und brachte meine Zweifel an den verrückten Hoffnungen auf den »neuen Menschen« zu Wort",
        "In einer Religion, die Gott zum Privateigentum macht... ist es notwendig, den alten umfassenden Begriff Gerechtigkeit durch »fairness« zu ersetzen",
        "Gott hat keine anderen Hände als unsere [Teresa of Avila]"

      "strengths": [
        "Masterful synthesis of Marxist philosophy (Bloch) and Christian mysticism.",
        "Radical reframing of 'manifest' as 'public' (öffentlich).",
        "The context of the 'market' is used to highlight the counter-cultural nature of the Gospel."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The historical context of 1989 might feel dated to a modern listener without more specific examples.",
        "The connection between 'mysticism' and 'market critique' could be even more explicit.",
        "The 'fig tree' story feels slightly disconnected from the 'market' context."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "The sermon offers a powerful new frame: the 'not yet' as a political and spiritual resistance against the 'status quo'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon functions as an 'open work of art' (Stark). It does not offer a 'happy ending' or a simple moralistic checklist. Instead, it invites the hearer into a 'longing' (Sehnsucht) that grows with fulfillment. By ending with the 'not yet' and the image of 'closed gates', Sölle leaves the responsibility of 're-occupying' the word 'Love' to the hearer. It acknowledges the ambivalence of being both 'children of God' and 'destroyers of the earth' without resolving the tension cheaply.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wir werden nicht satt in Gott, sondern hungriger.",
        "Wir müssen uns angewöhnen, ihn jeden Tag neu zu besetzen",
        "Es ist noch nicht erschienen, was wir sein werden."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The ending is an invitation to action and perception, not a closed conclusion.",
        "The sermon honors the 'mystery' (Geheimnis) of religion.",
        "It treats the listener as a mature partner in the 'search' for God."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'we must' (Wir müssen) in the final paragraph leans slightly toward the prescriptive.",
        "The 'mystical impertinence' could be further explored to allow for more subjective interpretations.",
        "The resolution of the 'prophetic vs mystic' tension is quite tidy."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Polyvalent; it allows for both political and deeply personal appropriations."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-structure is a sophisticated dialectic between two modes of being: the prophetic and the mystic. Sölle avoids a linear, moralistic progression, opting instead for a 'reframing' of reality that challenges the hearer's perception. The sermon moves from a critique of the present to a mystical 'dwelling' in God, finally returning to the world with a renewed sense of 'not yet'. It is a structurally sound journey that maintains tension and respects the open-ended nature of the biblical promise."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a masterclass in anti-kitsch. Sölle explicitly warns against 'staying in the sweetness' (Meister Eckhart), which is her definition of religious kitsch. She refuses to offer immediate comfort, instead highlighting the 'stench' of child labor and the 'destruction' of the earth. The 'happy ending' is replaced by a 'growing hunger'. There is no sentimentality here, only authentic, often painful, emotion. She sustains the 'lament' of the 'not yet' throughout the entire discourse.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'allzu vollmundige' (too full-mouthed) claim that we are already children of God without acknowledging our role as 'destroyers'.",
      "The 'sweetness' of mysticism that remains a private affair."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission of being a 'duseliges, halbherziges Wesen'.",
      "The insistence that God is 'dependent' on our love."

    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of critical distance from 'cheap grace' and 'easy comfort'."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space is opened through the concept of 'reframing' and the refusal to 'possess' the gift of God. By emphasizing that we 'become hungrier' in God, Sölle creates a vast aesthetic space for grace that is not a commodity but a movement. The 'Space for Grace' is found in the 'between' (Cilliers) of the 'already' and the 'not yet'. She avoids moralization by framing our actions as 'God's hands', making ethics a participation in grace rather than a legalistic burden.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'child of God' and 'enemy of God' is sustained and becomes the engine of the sermon.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'mystery' is central; God is found in 'strange hiding places'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails as the 'dwelling' that enables the prophetic action.",
    "recommendation": "Continue to emphasize the 'unavailability' of the gift to prevent it from becoming a new law."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the 'prophetic-mystic' style. Its primary strength lies in its 'stewardship of language' and its ability to 'reframe' reality. Sölle avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by grounding her mysticism in political reality and her politics in mystical 'dwelling'. The sermon functions as an 'open work of art' that invites the listener into a state of 'active waiting' (the 'not yet'). While the structure is intellectually dense, the musicality of the prose and the somatic imagery ensure it remains accessible and performative. It successfully creates a 'space for grace' by refusing to offer cheap solutions to the 'turning of the times'.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of biblical concepts into contemporary political and philosophical contexts.",
      "Complete absence of religious kitsch; deep commitment to authentic, 'hungry' spirituality.",
      "Strong rhythmic and musical qualities that support the oral delivery."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The transition into the 1989/market critique could be more organically woven into the biblical imagery.",
      "Some sections lean heavily on intellectual/philosophical authority (Bloch, Barth, Eckhart), which may distance less academic hearers.",
      "The 'fig tree' metaphor could be more fully developed as a visual anchor."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Mystic / Dialectical",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Kitsch-critique) and Ciska Stark (Open work of art).",
    "audience_analysis": "Intellectually engaged hearers, those disillusioned with traditional dogma, and those seeking a 'political' spirituality.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Incorporate more 'everyday' sensory details to balance the high-level philosophical references.",
      "Experiment with leaving the 'turning point' even more open to the hearer's imagination.",
      "Use more 'showing' in the mystical sections to match the vividness of the prophetic sections."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A high-quality sermon that exemplifies the 'aesthetic turn' by making the form (the dialectic of voices) inseparable from the content (the 'not yet' of God's kingdom). It is a model of how to use language with precision and 'holy impertinence' to open space for an encounter with the Divine that is both deeply personal and radically public."
