[...] Look at what Jesus Christ did on the cross for you. Take that to the center of your life until money become just money. Scatter your gifts, and wait until you see how he works through that. Let us pray.",
    "notes": "The sermon follows a classic Tim Keller-esque structure: Problem (Money's power), Why (Idolatry), and Solution (The Cross)."

  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates strong exegetical competence, particularly in the semantic analysis of 'righteous' vs. 'wicked' in the wisdom tradition. By citing Bruce Waltke, he moves the 'blue' side from mere moralism to a structural understanding of community (disadvantaging self vs. disadvantaging others). The factual content is well-structured into three logical movements: the power of money, the 'why' of its power, and the 'how' of breaking it. However, the exegesis of Proverbs 11:4 ('day of wrath') is somewhat flattened to psychological grief, potentially missing the broader eschatological horizon of the Hebrew text. The 'blue' side remains highly accessible, avoiding overly dense dogmatics while maintaining intellectual integrity.",
      "quotes": [
        "The wicked person is someone who disadvantages the community to advantage himself.",

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The use of modern analogies (accounting, ROI, Kindle) bridges the gap between ancient text and modern hearer."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher uses self-revelation with surgical precision. He avoids the 'hysterical' trap of making the sermon about his own drama, instead using his personal struggle with 'academic press books' as a diaconal tool to illustrate idolatry. This 'green' signal is vulnerable yet controlled, serving the 'blue' content. There is an involuntary 'leak' of intellectualism—his self-confessed identity as a 'teacher' is evident in the lecture-style delivery. He reveals himself as someone who values 'knowing' as a form of security, which creates a bridge of authenticity with a likely high-intellect congregation.",
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive/Schizoid blend. The preacher seeks control through structure and intellectual categorization (Compulsive) while maintaining a certain professional distance, focusing on the 'Sache' rather than emotional fusion (Schizoid).",
      "diaconal_quality": "High. The 'I' is used to model the application of the Gospel to the self, not to seek admiration.",
      "strengths": [
        "Authentic confession of specific, non-cliché sins (intellectual pride).",
        "Avoids 'non-committal warmth' by being honest about the difficulty of giving."

        "The tone is occasionally overly didactic, which can mask the preacher's own existential 'trembling' before the Word."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher-Student' or 'Mentor-Mentee'. He uses phrases like 'I'm just here to tell you' and 'Don't shoot the messenger,' which creates a buffer between his person and the hard truth of the text. There is a 'we-definition' of shared struggle ('every single person in this room, including me'), but the authority remains firmly with the pulpit. The 'yellow' side is solidary but paternalistic. He anticipates the hearer's resistance ('Typical pastor... you're not being practical'), which shows high relational awareness, but the 'eye level' is occasionally lost in the instructional tone.",
      "quotes": [
        "I’m just here to tell you. Don’t shoot the messenger.",
        "Forgive me for giving you an entire sermon in about 90 seconds.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon navigates the Law/Gospel tension with skill. The 'red' side (the appeal to give) is explicitly grounded in the 'blue' side (the promise of the Cross). He avoids the 'moralism' trap by stating that the 'wrong first question' is 'how much?'. However, the final appeal for 'measurable sacrifice' reintroduces a high-pressure demand. While he frames it as a response to grace, the 'appeal ear' of the listener might still hear a new law. The 'Zuspruch' (Jesus as the scattered treasure) is the engine for the 'Anspruch' (scatter your gifts).",
      "quotes": [
        "The first question is... Why don’t you want to give away more?",
        "You should be giving away so much... that it makes a measurable difference.",

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The promise (Zuspruch) is the foundation, but the demand (Anspruch) is sharp and quantifiable.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Moderate. The '10% is just Old Testament' argument can feel like a 'Law+' to a sensitive ear.",
      "strengths": [
        "Refusal to give a simple 'to-do' list without the Cross.",
        "Deep psychological insight into why we resist the appeal."

    "disruptions": "A slight 'yellow' noise occurs when the preacher assumes the role of the 'messenger' who shouldn't be shot—it creates a momentary distance from the shared 'we'.",
    "healing_disruption": "The disruption occurs when he redefines 'righteous' and 'wicked'—it breaks the hearer's self-image of being 'good' just because they aren't 'criminals'."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a highly effective, intellectually rigorous sermon that successfully integrates psychological depth with Reformed theology. The preacher avoids the common pitfall of 'holiday moralism' by grounding the appeal for generosity in the Christological 'Sache' (the Cross as wealth distribution). The use of Schulz von Thun's model reveals a preacher who is very conscious of his 'green' side, using it as a bridge rather than a stage. The 'blue' side is the strongest, providing a clear, structural framework for understanding money. The 'yellow' side maintains a professional distance that, while clear, lacks the 'depressive' warmth some congregants might crave, but fits the 'compulsive/schizoid' preacher type perfectly. Theologically, it satisfies the Barthian requirement of making God (in Christ) the acting subject of the solution, though the 'appeal' side remains quite sharp.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon flirts with psychologization by focusing heavily on 'identity' and 'security' (anthropocentric), but rescues itself by insisting that only the objective 'Name of the Lord' (theocentric) provides the solution.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Excellent Christological 'turn' (Jesus as the scattered treasure).",
      "Sharp psychological diagnosis of money as a 'fortified city'.",
      "Congruent use of personal illustration."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Soften the didactic 'Teacher' stance to allow for more 'Fellow-Sinner' resonance.",
      "Broaden the 'day of wrath' exegesis beyond personal grief.",
      "Be cautious with 'measurable sacrifice' as a new legalistic metric."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, communicative, and theologically sound sermon that achieves its goal through clarity and Christocentric focus. It avoids the 'Satisfactory' baseline by its exceptional structural integrity."
