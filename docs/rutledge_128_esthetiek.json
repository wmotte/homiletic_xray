    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Rutledge employs imagery primarily through contrast. She juxtaposes the 'soft' imagery of spring (flowers, eggs, bunnies) with the 'hard' imagery of the tomb and the 'stark ugliness of death.' Following Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don’t tell,' she vividly paints the scene of the women at the cemetery, forcing the hearer to visualize the 'appalling change' in a dead body. The imagery is not merely decorative but serves a polemical and theological purpose: to distinguish between natural cycles and the 'anti-natural' event of the Resurrection. While she avoids overly flowery language, her concrete descriptions of the 'stench' of death (implied) and the 'twinkling of an eye' create a high-contrast visual field for the listener.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise, reflecting Marilyn Chandler McEntyre’s 'stewardship of language.' Rutledge carefully deconstructs vague religious jargon like 'renewal' and 'rebirth,' exposing them as evasions of the harder word 'Resurrection.' Her word choice is economical and intellectually rigorous. She avoids 'Canaanite' language by speaking directly to the 'unbelieving friend' and the 'sophisticated church person.' The precision lies in her refusal to allow words to mean less than they do; she insists on the 'inexorable' and 'damned' nature of death, using blunt, almost jarring vocabulary to ensure the hearer cannot hide behind platitudes.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a strong rhetorical cadence, characterized by a 'staccato' delivery in the diagnostic sections and a 'legato' flow during the scriptural proclamations. Rutledge uses parallelism effectively ('Some of you... Some are here...'). There is a palpable rhythm of 'attack and comfort'—she attacks the false hope of spring festivals and then offers the rhythmic comfort of the Pauline epistles. The structure of the sentences suggests a text written for the ear, with clear pauses for emphasis. The final paragraph builds to a crescendo of 'faithfulness' that mirrors the liturgical 'Alleluia.'",

    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that prioritizes truth-telling over ornamentation. Rutledge practices high stewardship of language by stripping away sentimental clichés to reveal the 'stark' reality of the kerygma. Her imagery is grounded in the physical and the historical, avoiding the 'kitsch' of spring metaphors. The musicality is found in the rhythmic repetition and the authoritative tone that echoes classical rhetoric. It is a 'witness' style: precise, urgent, and intellectually honest, successfully bridging the gap between the academy and the pew."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Lowry-esque' plot: it begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' by questioning why the 'Easter-only' crowd is present. It then moves into the 'complication'—the modern embarrassment with the physical resurrection. The 'climax' or turning point is the shift from 'natural rebirth' to the 'anti-natural' event of the empty tomb. Rutledge sustains the tension by refusing to give an early 'happy ending.' She forces the listener to sit with the 'appalling change' of the dead body before the final resolution. The movement is not a static three-point sermon but a journey from the 'bunnies' of the front yard to the 'victory' over the grave.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a masterclass in Cilliers' 'reframing.' Rutledge takes the contemporary context—the 'Jesus Seminar,' the New York intellectual scene, the grieving widow—and reframes them through the lens of the 1st-century 'beleaguered' disciples. She respects the 'strangeness' of the biblical text, refusing to modernize it into 'love is stronger than death.' Instead, she forces the context to bow to the text. The integration is organic because she uses the context (the widow's grief) to prove the necessity of the text's radicality. She doesn't just 'apply' the text; she shows that without the literal resurrection, the context is hopeless.",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "In terms of Ciska Stark's 'open work of art,' this sermon is more 'closed' or 'monovalent.' Rutledge is a 'witness' (Thomas Long), and her witness is definitive. She leaves little room for the 'Jesus Seminar' interpretation to be valid. However, it is 'open' in the sense that it invites the hearer into the 'mystery' (1 Cor 15). She acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' and the 'disappointments of life.' While the theological conclusion is sealed, the human experience of 'waiting' and 'defiance' remains an open invitation. It is not a 'coercive schema' but a 'bold proclamation' that demands a 'yes' or 'no' from the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "I believe the body of Jesus was in a tomb, and that it disappeared.",
        "It is not 'my' belief. It does not belong to me. It is the church’s belief, and so it belongs to you too.",
        "Hope and strength and courage and defiance in daily life."

        "The binary between 'intellectual' and 'simpleminded' could be softened to allow more 'inter-esse'.",
        "More room could be left for the 'silence' of the empty tomb before the 'trumpets' of the conclusion."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Relatively closed structure; it is a kerygmatic 'proclamation' rather than a 'poetic exploration'."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is robust and purposeful. Rutledge constructs a narrative arc that intentionally deconstructs the hearer's 'natural' expectations of Easter before rebuilding them on the 'anti-natural' foundation of the Resurrection. The integration of text and context is the sermon's greatest structural strength, using 'reframing' to make the ancient text more 'real' than the contemporary 'myths' of progress. While the structure is more 'closed' than 'open' due to its strong kerygmatic stance, it creates a 'Space for Grace' by taking the 'enemy' of death seriously."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is a profound critique of religious kitsch. Rutledge explicitly identifies 'springtime sentiments' and 'innocuous rebirth' as the kitsch that blocks a true encounter with the Holy. She refuses the 'happy ending' that doesn't account for the 'appalling change' of the dead body. By sustaining the tension of the 'damned inexorable' nature of death, she achieves authentic aesthetic depth. There is no sentimentality here; even the 'bunnies' are dismissed as 'horrors' if they obscure the 'real thing.' The emotion is authentic because it is born of 'disappointment' and 'devastation,' not 'wishful thinking.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'green blade riseth' metaphor as a 'natural, predictable event'.",
      "Easter as a 'spring festival celebrating the ancient myths of the Mediterranean imagination'."

      "The description of the 'appalling change' in the look and feel of a dead body.",
      "The mention of the grieving widow for whom flowers and birds were 'agonizing... like a mockery'."

    "recommendation": "Maintain this rigorous 'anti-kitsch' stance, as it is the sermon's primary source of aesthetic and theological power."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace precisely by closing the doors on human effort and natural optimism. Following Cilliers, Rutledge creates a 'Space for Grace' by emphasizing the 'radically discontinuous' nature of God's action. Grace is not a 'new season' we can cultivate; it is a 'victory' won by an 'Other.' By sustaining the tension between the 'stark ugliness of death' and the 'trumpet of the Resurrection,' she allows the 'Holy' to happen as an event. The mystery of God's faithfulness is respected as something that 'turns the key in the lock of the gate of Hell,' an image that is both aesthetic and profoundly theological.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between the 'enemy' of death and the 'victory' of Christ is held until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, the Resurrection is treated as a 'mystery' and an 'unpredictable' act of God, not a logical conclusion.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails entirely. The sermon explicitly moves away from 'we must' to 'God is faithful'.",
    "recommendation": "To create even more space, allow for a moment of 'Sabbath silence' or 'Holy Saturday' within the text to let the weight of the 'empty' tomb sink in before the 'trumpets'."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.7,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high-caliber 'Kerygmatic-Aesthetic' style. Its beauty lies not in 'beautifying writing' but in the 'sober beauty' of truth-telling. Rutledge successfully navigates the 'aesthetic turn' by recognizing that the *how* of the sermon (its imagery of death, its rhythmic deconstruction of kitsch) is inseparable from its *what* (the physical resurrection). The sermon is aesthetically powerful because it is 'anti-kitsch'; it refuses the easy aesthetic of spring for the difficult aesthetic of the empty tomb. It functions as a 'witness' in the sense of Thomas Long, where the preacher’s voice becomes transparent to the 'event' of the Resurrection. While it leans towards a 'closed' structure, this is a deliberate rhetorical choice to mirror the 'finality' of the Resurrection victory. It is an intellectually demanding and emotionally honest performance that creates a genuine 'Space for Grace' in a skeptical age.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rigorous deconstruction of religious kitsch and sentimentalism.",
      "Powerful 'reframing' of the Resurrection as an anti-natural, historical event.",

      "Continue to use the 'reframing' technique as it is a primary aesthetic strength."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, aesthetically coherent sermon that serves as a model for 'anti-kitsch' preaching. It achieves a score of 7.7 because it transcends 'paper language' to become a performative 'event' of proclamation. It is a 'Space for Grace' that honors both the gravity of human death and the 'awesome responsibility' of the Easter witness."
