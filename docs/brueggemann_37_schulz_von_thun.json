    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates a solid grasp of the liturgical calendar and the narrative flow of Acts 16. The 'Sache'—the Lordship of Christ (Ascension)—is the central pillar. However, the exegetical depth is sacrificed for narrative pace. The interpretation of the slave girl as a representative of 'gnosticism or New Age' is a modern projection that lacks historical-critical grounding, though it serves the communicative goal of relevance. The theological 'Sache' (Barth's Living Christ) is present but treated more as a narrative catalyst than a dogmatic reality to be wrestled with. The connection between the earthquake and the 'Easter God' is clear, but the sermon avoids the harder 'blue' questions of theodicy or the mechanics of ancient exorcism, opting for a psychological transposition of 'true selves'.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is a Sunday when all these matters converge: resurrection / ascent to power / spirit.",
        "The destructive spirit obeyed Paul: It came out!",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher maintains a professional, almost academic distance initially, revealing a 'Compulsive' (Riemann) need for order and liturgical correctness. There is a controlled 'Selbstdarstellung' as a seasoned observer of the church year. However, a 'Depressive' (harmony-seeking) element emerges in the desire to translate 'weird' biblical events into palatable psychological categories ('true selves', 'anxiety'). The 'I' is largely diaconal, serving the text, but there is a hint of intellectual superiority in the dismissal of 'weird' exorcisms as things 'people like us' find strange. The preacher reveals a worldview that values social justice and emancipation, but does so from a safe, rhetorical distance.",
      "quotes": [
        "In my church in the UCC...",
        "I imagine the lectionary committee sitting and thinking...",
        "Now I know that this story has nothing to do with you, as it really has nothing to do with me."

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Depressive. Compulsive in the structural adherence to the lectionary and 'correct' liturgical themes; Depressive in the softening of the text's 'strangeness' to ensure it feels relevant and non-threatening to the listener's psyche.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is mostly subservient, but the preacher's own modern skepticism regarding the supernatural 'leaks' through.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined by solidarity. The preacher uses 'we' and 'us' consistently, placing themselves under the same judgment and promise as the congregation. There is a 'teaching' attitude that is not paternalistic but rather invitational. The 'Yellow' side is strongest when the preacher acknowledges the potential distance between the ancient text and the modern hearer, bridge-building through shared vulnerability ('unless wanting to be free...'). However, there is a slight 'relationship noise' in the assumption that the congregation finds the text 'outrageous' or 'weird'—a projection that might not hold for all believers.",

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon balances Zuspruch (Promise) and Anspruch (Demand) reasonably well, though it leans toward the 'Appeal' of self-actualization. The primary appeal is to 'refer our lives to Jesus' and to 'decide afresh'. Theologically, the 'Red' side is grounded in the 'Blue' fact of Christ's power (Ascension). However, there is a risk of moralism in the translation of exorcism into 'becoming our true selves'. This psychologizes the Gospel into a program for self-improvement rather than a radical act of God. The 'Gift' (freedom) is presented, but the 'Demand' (the risk of disturbing the peace) is kept somewhat abstract.",

  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a professionally crafted sermon that successfully navigates a difficult narrative text by utilizing the liturgical framework of the 'Great Fifty Days'. The preacher effectively uses the Relational side to bridge the gap between the 'outrageous' biblical world and the modern pew. However, from a Barthian perspective, there is a significant 'unhealthy psychologization' where the cosmic victory of Christ (Ascension) is reduced to the psychological category of 'becoming our true selves'. While communicatively fluid, the sermon lacks the 'razor-sharp' theological edge that would elevate it to a higher score. It remains a 'Satisfactory to Ample Satisfactory' performance—safe, solid, but perhaps too eager to resolve the text's 'strangeness' into modern categories of 'joy' and 'freedom'.",
    "barthian_warning": "High risk. The 'Acting Subject' (God) is often replaced by the 'Experiencing Subject' (the human seeking freedom/true self).",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Strong narrative flow.",
      "Effective use of liturgical context.",
      "Solidary relationship with the congregation."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Resist the urge to psychologize theological categories (Exorcism -> True Self).",
      "Allow the 'strangeness' of God to remain strange without immediate domesticating explanations.",
      "Increase the theological weight of the 'Zuspruch' (Promise)."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively competent sermon that serves the congregation well but misses the opportunity for a truly prophetic 'disruption' by leaning too heavily on psychological relevance."
