    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust. It avoids the common trap of religious manipulation (guilt/shame) by instead focusing on the shared human condition of suffering. The preacher uses his 'Parent' ego to provide a holding environment for the listener's 'Child,' while using 'Adult' processing to validate the reality of pain. The primary risk is the 'theology of the cross' becoming a psychological mandate for perpetual sorrow as a prerequisite for spiritual authority.",
    "strengths": [
      "High empathy and validation of the listener's reality.",
      "Rejection of judgmental/persecutory religious frameworks.",
      "Integration of poetic 'Free Child' energy with 'Nurturing Parent' wisdom."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The link between 'sorrow' and 'power' could be interpreted as a 'Gimmick' that rewards the Victim role.",
      "More 'Adult' application on how to navigate the 'narrow window' practically could balance the emotional weight."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Ensure that the 'necessity of suffering' does not become a psychological 'Con' where the listener seeks out pain to feel spiritually superior or 'powerful.' Continue to address the listener as a capable 'Adult' who can look out the window for themselves."
