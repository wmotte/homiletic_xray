    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively uses the life of Oscar Romero to create a concrete experience. It avoids abstract 'saints' and instead presents a man who makes mistakes and experiences physical exhaustion. The hearer is invited into specific scenes—a mud path, a village without food, a tense political rally. However, the connection to the hearer's immediate physical reality in Hamburg is less developed than the historical narrative of El Salvador.",

      "analysis": "Reflection occurs primarily through the lens of 'learning from the poor.' The preacher pauses to consider why Romero was effective and how he was converted by his context. There is a clear cultural critique regarding the 'expert' culture and the distance we keep from saints. However, the 'why' of the congregation's own situation remains somewhat under-analyzed; the reflection is mostly mirrored through the Salvadoran experience.",

      "analysis": "Theological depth is present but remains secondary to the narrative. The 'big idea' is the definition of the Holy Spirit's power as 'Mut und Wahrheitsfähigkeit.' While this is a strong conceptual anchor, the exegesis of Acts 1:8 is minimal. The text is used more as a motto than a subject of rigorous theological or logical development. The connection between 'the dead are not dead' and the biblical text is asserted rather than argued.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of narrative-visionary preaching that relies heavily on biographical illustration to convey theological truth. It succeeds in humanizing the concept of 'witness' through the vulnerable and gritty details of Oscar Romero's life. However, it falls short in providing a rigorous theological exegesis of the Acts text and fails to offer concrete, actionable steps for the congregation's specific context in Hamburg. The movement through Kolb's cycle is present but unbalanced, favoring the 'feeling' and 'watching' quadrants while neglecting the 'doing' quadrant. The result is a sermon that is highly inspirational but potentially leaves the hearer without a clear path for implementation.",

      "Use a local contemporary example alongside the historical/global one to ground the Concrete Experience"
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon 'Zeugen der Wahrheit' is a compelling narrative piece that excels in the 'Visionary' and 'Narrative' quadrants of Anderson’s model. It effectively uses the 'Concrete Experience' of Oscar Romero to engage the heart and imagination. However, from a Kolb perspective, the cycle remains incomplete due to a lack of specific 'Active Experimentation.' The preacher successfully moves the hearer to feel and reflect, but the transition to 'doing' is too vague. To move from a 6 to an 8, the sermon would need to bridge the gap between the mud paths of El Salvador and the streets of Hamburg with specific ethical handles and a more robust theological framework."
