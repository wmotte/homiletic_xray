    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience primarily through the narrative retelling of the parable. It attempts to ground the abstract concept of prayer in the recognizable (though ancient) setting of a courtroom. However, it lacks a contemporary 'slice of life' hook in the introduction, opting instead for a thematic opening. The identification with the widow is strong on a conceptual level but remains somewhat distanced by the 'ancient, patriarchal world' framing.",
      "quotes": [
        "She probably is not well dressed. She does not talk right. She cannot afford a lawyer, so she presents her own case . . . poorly.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon is strong in analyzing the human condition, specifically the tension between romanticism and cynicism in prayer. It pauses to explore the 'why' behind the widow's persistence and the judge's indifference. It offers a cultural critique of how we view justice and prayer, moving beyond surface-level reading to examine the power dynamics at play.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are too romantic about prayer... Or we are too cynical about prayer, because we do not believe anything happens anyway.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The theological exposition is solid and central to the sermon. The preacher provides a clear 'big idea': prayer as an act of hope and a demand for justice. The exegesis of the word 'justice' (v. 3, 5, 7, 8) provides a logical framework that shifts the hearer's understanding from retributive to distributive justice. The 'playful rabbinic story' framework allows for a daring theological move regarding the character of God.",

        "The Bible means by justice that everyone... are entitled to all that is needed for dignity, peace, freedom, health, joy, and security.",

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the sermon calls for 'nagging prayers for justice,' the application remains largely categorical rather than concrete. It lists groups that need justice (homeless, abused, etc.), but it does not provide specific 'how-to' steps for the congregation to implement this 'nagging' in their specific context. The call to 'pray always' is a general imperative rather than a facilitated action plan.",
      "quotes": [

It effectively deconstructs common misconceptions about prayer (romanticism vs. cynicism) and provides a robust biblical definition of justice.

The 'Active Experimentation' phase is replaced by a high-level ethical call that, while inspiring, does not equip the hearer with specific handles for change.

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a well-crafted piece of homiletical work that excels in the Narrative and Declarative tasks. From a Kolb perspective, it successfully moves the hearer from the 'feeling' of the story to the 'thinking' of the theology. Its primary diagnosis is a lack of 'doing.' The preacher provides a compelling vision of what prayer *is* (hopeful nagging for justice) but leaves the congregation without a clear map of how to *do* it in their specific context. To move from a 6.2 to a higher score, the sermon needs to transition from an inspiring lecture on the nature of prayer to a practical guide for the life of faith."
