    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with cultural artifacts (Shroud of Turin, Joan of Arc, movies) rather than direct personal experience. While these are recognizable, they function more as intellectual 'hooks' than emotional 'slices of life.' The hearer is addressed as a spectator of culture before being addressed as a participant in the faith. The emotional connection is strongest when discussing the 'vulnerability' of the hearer toward the end, but the sermon largely stays in the realm of historical and cinematic illustration rather than raw, immediate human experience.",

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength of the sermon. The preacher excels at pausing to ask 'why' and 'how' regarding human perceptions of Jesus. There is a sophisticated analysis of the 'problem'—specifically the human tendency to construct a Jesus to suit oneself. The sermon critiques the superficiality of 'spiritual experiences' derived from media and contrasts them with the depth of the biblical narrative. It explores the human condition as one of 'bondage' and 'hostage,' using the Nazi occupation as a powerful interpretive lens.",
      "quotes": [
        "But what is the content of those spiritual experiences? What do they move us to think and feel?",
        "Where do we go for guidance in this matter? How are we to evaluate this sort of claim?",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a solid theological exposition of the 'ransom' (lutron) concept. It correctly identifies the 'Son of Man' as a messianic title from Daniel 7 and explains the mechanics of substitutionary atonement without falling into crude literalism. The 'big idea' is the invasion of grace into territory held by evil. However, the preacher admits to 'mixing metaphors' and 'stretching for words,' which, while honest, slightly diffuses the logical clarity for an 'assimilating' learner seeking a single, tight systematic framework.",
      "quotes": [
        "In Jesus' time, 'Son of Man' was a numinous title referring to a hoped-for heavenly figure...",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the sermon ends with a call to join the 'underground' and 'Christ's army of resistance,' the instructions remain largely metaphorical. The 'small deed' and 'quiet gesture' are mentioned, but not defined. The hearer is told they are 'foot soldiers,' but the specific 'marching orders' for the coming week are absent. The application is more about a change in 'heart' (defiant confidence) than a change in specific ethical behaviors.",

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong example of a 'Visionary-Declarative' approach that prioritizes theological depth and imaginative resonance over practical application. It successfully completes the first three phases of Kolb's cycle but fails to provide a robust 'Active Experimentation' phase. The diagnosis is a sermon that is intellectually and spiritually stimulating but practically thin. For a Holy Week context, the emphasis on 'awe' and 'cosmic victory' is appropriate, but for holistic adult learning, the preacher must bridge the gap between the 'heavy artillery' of God and the 'foot soldier' tasks of the believer with greater specificity."
