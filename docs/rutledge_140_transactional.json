It intentionally cultivates an 'unbearable tension' and utilizes 'Ain't It Awful' dynamics to separate the 'true' church from the 'cheap' world. While it aims for theological depth, it relies on Adapted Child fear (the Master's return as a threat) and Critical Parent judgment. The listener is left in a state of hyper-vigilance and self-negation, which can lead to religious burnout or dependency.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation's Adult ego more consistently by offering choices rather than 'musts.' Balance the 'power from outside' with an acknowledgment of the listener's internal resources (Free Child) to respond to God's grace without fear of the 'axe.'"
