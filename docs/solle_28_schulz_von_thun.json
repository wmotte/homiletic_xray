    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The factual side provides a solid introduction to the Psalter and the specific structure of Psalm 118. The preacher explains the liturgical origins and the 'tripartite' address (Israel, Aaron, God-fearing). However, the 'Sache' (the living Christ or the acting God) is frequently displaced by socio-economic analysis. While the exegesis of 'Enge' (distress/narrowness) and 'Gerechtigkeit' (justice) is linguistically grounded, the theological 'blue' side often serves as a mere springboard for a critique of neoliberalism. The factual content is highly comprehensible but risks becoming a vehicle for a specific political ideology rather than exploring the multi-layered dogmatic depth of the text itself.",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals herself as a 'struggling believer' who identifies with the 'skeptics' and 'wing-lame' (flügellahm). There is a high degree of authenticity in admitting her own difficulty with praising God ('Warum ich Gott so selten lobe'). She uses poetry to bridge the gap between her personal silence and the biblical command to praise. The self-revelation is not narcissistic but serves to validate the listener's own doubts. She positions herself as someone who has been 'trying for 50 years' to think beyond the 'real,' showing a life-long commitment to a specific theological path. The 'I' is vulnerable but intellectually combative.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship to the audience is complex. On one hand, there is a strong sense of 'we' (solidarity with the marginalized). On the other hand, there is a sharp, almost paternalistic rebuke of those who might disagree with her political stance (e.g., 'Who taught you this nonsense?'). The preacher defines the relationship through shared resistance. If the listener does not share her critique of the 'multinational corporations,' they may feel excluded or judged. The 'yellow' signal is one of a teacher-activist leading a movement, which can create 'relationship noise' for those seeking traditional pastoral comfort.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward 'Anspruch' (Demand/Appeal). While the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is present in the idea of the 'wide space,' it is immediately tied to political action (Seattle, Davos, anti-globalization). The Gospel risk here is that 'Gerechtigkeit' (Justice) becomes a new Law. The appeal is to join the 'globalization from below.' The theological promise that God acts is often replaced by the appeal that *we* must act or 'build the house.' This creates a high pressure on the 'dutiful listener' to be a political activist to be considered 'just' or 'right with God.'",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6,
    "summary": "This is a quintessential 'political sermon' that uses Psalm 118 as a manifesto for 'globalization from below.' Communicatively, it is powerful and poetic, utilizing the 'green' side (self-revelation) effectively to build a bridge of shared human experience. However, from a Barthian perspective, it suffers from significant 'psychologization' and 'politicization.' God risks becoming a function of human justice movements rather than the 'Acting Subject.' The 'red' side (appeal) dominates to such an extent that the 'blue' side (theological promise) is often instrumentalized. The sermon succeeds in creating a 'healing disruption' against economic fatalism but fails to provide the 'rest in God' that the Psalm also offers. It is a 'law-heavy' sermon where the Gospel is found in the 'wide space' of our own activism.",
    "barthian_warning": "High. The sermon risks making God an object of our political conversation rather than the Subject who justifies the ungodly.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Poetic and evocative language.",
      "Authentic self-revelation regarding doubt.",
      "Sharp and necessary critique of modern 'narrowness' (Enge)."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Balance the political 'Anspruch' with more 'Zuspruch'.",
      "Reduce the polemical tone to broaden the 'yellow' relational reach.",
      "Let the biblical text speak more for itself without immediate political translation."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A rhetorically brilliant but theologically one-sided sermon that serves the 'prophetic' task at the expense of the 'priestly' task of comfort and unconditional grace."
