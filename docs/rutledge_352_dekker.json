When Jesus came to the grave of his friend, he ordered the bystanders to roll away the stone from the entrance to the tomb. Martha, the sister of the dead man [...] He is the Alpha and the Omega, the root and the offspring of David, the bright morning star, risen with healing in his wings: Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. 'Believest thou this?'"

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon centers on the raising of Lazarus and takes the 'stink' of the text seriously. However, it often drifts into general theological reflections on death and quotes from Paul or Shakespeare rather than mining the unique narrative details of John 11 that can be found 'nowhere else'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The reason I am talking about death in such stark terms is that the Bible talks about it.",
        "In the story of Lazarus, we see Jesus face to face with that reality."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more on the specific interaction between Jesus and the sisters in this text rather than using it as a springboard for a general theology of mortality."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "While the preacher acknowledges the 'unspiritual detail' of the smell and the Greek/Russian iconographic tradition, there is little technical exegesis of the Johannine context or the specific Greek nuances of Jesus being 'deeply moved'. The knowledge of Hebrew/Greek is not visible.",
      "quotes": [
        "John repeats three times that Jesus 'wept' and was 'deeply troubled'.",
        "Martha... seems to have a clue that Jesus might be able to do something."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the specific Johannine theology of 'signs' (semeia) and the linguistic weight of 'embrimasthai' (snorting with anger/deeply moved) to ground the exposition in the original context."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is largely psychological and cultural-philosophical. It critiques the 'American Way of Death' but remains at a level of general cultural observation rather than concrete congregational life. It lacks the 'true truth' of specific contemporary situations.",
      "quotes": [
        "Our culture is infamous for its unceasing attempts to manage death...",
        "Memorial services tend to be more Corinthian and less Biblical."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the general critique of the funeral industry to how this specific text speaks to the specific fears or 'stink' in the lives of the modern hearers."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon successfully mixes the description of the biblical scene with the preacher's own experiences as a priest. The hearer is drawn into the tomb alongside Jesus, though the 'application' often feels like a lecture on cultural history.",
      "quotes": [
        "I don't know how many of you have had an experience of actual death... I had never seen a dead body until I was a priest..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'exposition' of the text is what drives the 'application', rather than using personal anecdotes to validate the text."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is exceptionally strong on 'misery'. It does not shy away from the corruption of the body. Redemption is clearly placed outside of man (Christ's command). Gratitude (the third part) is the weakest, appearing only as a final rhetorical flourish.",
      "quotes": [
        "Death has a horrible color... a terrible icy feel.",
        "Death is the obscene mystery, the ultimate affront, the thing that cannot be controlled."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Develop the 'gratitude' section more fully—how does the 'undone' death lead to a life of service and spirit-led thanks?"
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher explicitly asks if Lazarus had a choice, concluding he did not. While this emphasizes God's sovereignty, it risks removing the 'responsible being' from the equation. The 'seriousness of being lost' is present in the power of death, but the 'narrow way' of life is less defined.",
      "quotes": [
        "When Jesus said, 'Lazarus, come forth,' did Lazarus have a choice?",
        "Could Lazarus have said 'No!' to the summons of Death?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the hearer's responsibility to 'believe' (as Jesus asks Martha) more urgently, rather than presenting it as a cosmic inevitability."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is the clear telos. The sermon moves toward the 'One Lord' who countermands death. The doctrine of the two natures is implied in the 'Word Incarnate' who weeps yet commands creation. Grace is the final word.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is Jesus Christ, the Word Incarnate who 'dwelt among us'...",
        "Descending from the realm of light and life... comes One 'who is and who was'."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly link the 'grace' of Lazarus's raising to the 'grace' available to the hearer now, to avoid it becoming a purely objective historical/cosmic event."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 1850 words, the sermon likely falls just under the 20-minute threshold (at 100 words/min). According to Dekker, it lacks the 'breadth' required for true 'depth'.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical and dogmatic background to reach the 20-minute minimum for substantive depth."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a sober and stark meditation on mortality that succeeds in taking the 'misery' of death seriously, avoiding modern sentimentality. However, it falls short of Dekker's ideal by being slightly too short for full depth, relying heavily on literary and cultural-philosophical quotes rather than rigorous linguistic exegesis, and failing to provide a concrete, specific application for the contemporary congregation beyond a general critique of the 'zeitgeist'.",
    "strengths": [
      "Honest confrontation with the 'misery' of death and the 'stink' of the grave.",
      "Strong Christocentric focus where Christ is the sole actor in redemption.",
      "Effective use of the preacher's own priestly experience to ground the theology."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (under 20 minutes) for the 'breadth' Dekker requires.",
      "Lack of specific Hebrew/Greek exegesis or technical theological 'sleeping' background.",
      "Application remains at a general cultural level rather than a concrete congregational level."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'satisfactory' sermon (Score: 5.5) that honors the Word but leans too heavily on general truths about death rather than the radical specificity of the Lazarus pericope. It is a speech about 'death and resurrection' that happens to use Lazarus, rather than a recreation of the specific Word of God found only in John 11."
