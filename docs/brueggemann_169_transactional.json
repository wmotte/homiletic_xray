    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably 'game-free.' By using the metaphor of a 'Gigantic Stage,' the preacher engages the Adult ego of the listener to observe their own behavior without triggering the defensiveness of the Adapted Child. It promotes autonomy by offering a choice of roles and avoids the common homiletical trap of the Drama Triangle. The preacher successfully balances Nurturing Parent (comfort) with Adult (analysis) and Free Child (imagination).",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult address that respects listener autonomy.",

      "High appeal to the Free Child through the 'imagination' and 'stage' metaphors."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from 'Beggar' to 'Healer' could benefit from more Adult-level practical steps to avoid sounding like a 'Rescuer' fantasy.",
      "Clarifying that 'mercy' isn't always 'material good things' to prevent a 'Bait & Switch' if the listener's material reality doesn't change."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'we' language to maintain the Adult-Adult level. Keep the invitation to 'imagine' as it bypasses the Critical Parent's filters and reaches the Free Child directly."
