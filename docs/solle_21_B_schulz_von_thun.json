    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a basic exegetical framework of the Genesis text, correctly identifying the historical context (Jacob's flight from Esau) and the philological ambiguity of the 'wrestler' (demon vs. angel). However, the 'Sache' in the Barthian sense—the objective revelation of God in Christ—is largely replaced by a phenomenological analysis of 'life transitions.' The theological depth is sacrificed for psychological accessibility. The distinction between the 'liberal error' of a nice God and the 'dark God' is a strong factual point, but it remains underdeveloped in favor of existential descriptions. The factual side serves primarily as a springboard for the preacher's personal and political reflections rather than a rigorous engagement with the living Word as an independent subject.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher is exceptionally transparent, revealing significant personal vulnerabilities. The 'green' side is dominant. By sharing the story of the Jewish woman in hiding, the transition to adulthood, and the impending death of the mother, the preacher offers a high degree of authenticity. This is not mere image management but a genuine 'Selbstenthüllung.' However, there is a risk that the preacher's biography overshadows the text. The 'I' is used as a hermeneutic key for the congregation's experience. While moving, the preacher teeters on the edge of making the pulpit a place of personal catharsis, though it remains largely 'diaconal' by aiming to validate the hearers' own fears.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined by solidarity and shared 'being-in-the-world.' The preacher speaks 'at eye level,' positioning themselves as a fellow traveler through 'dark rivers.' There is little 'from above' authority. However, the relationship noise occurs where the preacher assumes the congregation shares their specific political and existential anxieties (e.g., the specific mention of Soweto or blockades). This 'we-definition' can be inclusive for some but exclusionary for those who do not share the preacher's specific socio-political temperament. The tone is paternalistic in its 'wisdom of age' but remains fundamentally solidary.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The appeal is twofold: an existential appeal to 'wrestle' and a political appeal to 'act.' Theologically, the preacher attempts to ground the 'Anspruch' (demand) in the 'Zuspruch' (promise) of the blessing. However, the sermon ends with a heavy emphasis on human effort: 'das Ringen, das müssen wir schon selber tun.' This risks sliding into a new law of 'authentic struggling.' The 'Zuspruch' is that God is there, but the 'Anspruch' to be 'dreist' (bold) and to 'blockade' for peace becomes quite prominent. The Barthian 'Gift' is present but often feels like it must be 'wrestled' away from a reluctant God, which places the burden back on the believer.",

        "Ich lasse dich nicht, du segnest mich denn. Das ist der größte Satz...",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a highly authentic, biographically driven sermon that succeeds in making the Jacob story existentially relevant. Its strength lies in the 'Green' side—the preacher's willingness to be vulnerable. Theologically, it follows a tradition of 'struggle and resistance' (reminiscent of Dorothee Sölle), where the psychological process of wrestling is almost synonymous with the theological event of blessing. However, from a Barthian perspective, the sermon teeters on 'psychologization.' God risks becoming a projection of our 'life transitions' or a partner in our political 'nötigen' (coercion). The 'Blue' side is somewhat thin, as the text is used more as an illustration for human experience than as a sovereign Word that stands over and against the human condition. The 'Yellow' side is warm but potentially prescriptive in its political 'we.' It is a 'satisfactory to strong' performance that prioritizes the 'fides qua' (the act of believing/struggling) over the 'fides quae' (the content of faith).",
    "barthian_warning": "High risk of psychologization. God's action is largely interiorized into the human 'struggle' and 'wrestling.' The 'Acting Subject' (Immink) is often the wrestling human rather than the sovereign God.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Deeply moving and authentic personal narratives.",
      "Courageous rejection of a 'cheap' or 'nice' concept of God.",
      "Strong poetic conclusion that integrates the sermon's themes."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Increase the objective theological 'Sache' to balance the subjective experience.",
      "Reduce the 'I' content to allow the biblical text more independent space.",
      "Clarify the 'Zuspruch' (Grace) as the foundation, not the result, of the struggle."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively powerful sermon that excels in psychological authenticity but requires more theological 'Gegenüber' (counter-position) to avoid becoming purely therapeutic."
