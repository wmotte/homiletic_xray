    "summary": "This sermon is a masterclass in psychologically healthy homiletics. Taylor avoids the common trap of using guilt (Critical Parent) to motivate social change. Instead, he uses the Adult ego state to dismantle the 'logic' of segregation and the Nurturing Parent to offer a vision of brotherhood. By confessing his own church's failings, he levels the playing field, making a game-free encounter possible. The sermon moves from a cold analysis of 'expediency' to a warm, Free-Child-centered conclusion of communal worship.",

    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The use of 'must' in the early sections could be perceived as Critical Parent by a sensitive listener.",
      "The transition from socio-political Adult analysis to the theological 'Power of the Cross' requires a leap of faith that some 'Adult' listeners might find abrupt."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue the practice of 'self-indictment' alongside 'communal-indictment.' This prevents the listener from moving into the 'Rebellious Child' position and keeps the transaction Adult-to-Adult."
