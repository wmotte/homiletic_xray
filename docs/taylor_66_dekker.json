  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon focuses on John 11, specifically the tension between 'believing' and 'seeing'. However, it fails Dekker's requirement of finding what is in THIS text that is nowhere else. It treats the passage as a general illustration of God's power over death rather than the specific Christological revelation of the Fourth Gospel.",
      "quotes": [
        "He cuts across that grain and says here in this passage, 'If thou would believe, thou should see the glory of God.'",
        "The circumstance, of course, grows out of the death of Lazarus."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Isolate the unique Johannine 'Semeion' (sign) character of this miracle. Why must Lazarus die specifically so that the Son of Man may be glorified? Avoid generalities about 'God's ways'."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The exegesis is speculative rather than scholarly. The preacher muses on the 'dictionary of eternity' and whether Jesus 'forgot' his audience, which lacks the linguistic and historical rigor Dekker demands (Hebrew/Greek/Context). The claim that 'death' doesn't exist in Jesus' native land is poetic but exegetically unfounded.",
      "quotes": [
        "Maybe, maybe our Lord had forgotten the people he was talking to. He started talking the language of his native land.",
        "That word death does not occur in the dictionary of eternity. It's an earth word."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Replace speculative musings on the 'dictionary of eternity' with a concrete analysis of the Greek 'doxa' (glory) and the specific Jewish context of burial rites and the 'four days' belief."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application starts with concrete human psychology (attraction/repulsion) but quickly moves into generalities about 'venturing into the future'. It lacks the sharp cultural philosophy or sociological depth Dekker requires to address the zeitgeist.",
      "quotes": [
        "It takes a lot of grace for us to even begin to deal with what Jesus tells us.",
        "So believing and so trusting and so venturing forth into our future..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'stench' of the four-day-old corpse to specific, concrete 'stinking' situations in modern society or the hearer's life where hope is not just difficult, but 'kaput'."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon does reasonably well in mixing the narrative of Lazarus with the psychological state of the hearer. It avoids a strict 'first half exegesis, second half application' structure, which Dekker appreciates.",
      "quotes": [
        "Martha expresses for all of us a sense of finality beyond which it is futile to hold out hope.",
        "We, with our shrewdness and our slickness... we assert, 'Seeing is believing.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'exposition' side of the mix; the 'application' currently dominates the 'exposition' because the exegesis is thin."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The element of 'misery' (finality, death, stench) is present. 'Redemption' is found in Christ's authority. 'Gratitude' is the weakest part, appearing only as a vague 'venturing forth'. The psychological focus on 'repulsion' is a strong start for the 'misery' category.",
      "quotes": [
        "Dead, Lazarus is dead. Our Lord is talking here about finality. Kaput! Finis!",
        "Our refusal of God's company is cause for the tears of God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The 'misery' needs to be more than just physical death; it must be the misery of the 'natural grain' that resists God's Word."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "While the preacher mentions the 'high honor of choice', the sermon lacks the gravity of the 'two ways'. There is no real sense of being 'lost' in the Dekkerian sense; the ending is a general 'conquerors' sentiment that feels 'safe'.",
      "quotes": [
        "So God made us — with the high honor of choice. So often, we decide against the God who made us."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must address the consequence of refusing to 'believe' in order to 'see'. What is the 'destruction' for the one who stays by the closed, stinking tomb?"

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is strongly Christocentric. It correctly identifies Christ as the lens through which we see God and touches on the 'passibility' of God in Christ. Christ is the telos, though the 'two natures' doctrine is implied rather than robustly used.",
      "quotes": [
        "We come to behold the 'love of God' by way of 'the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.'",
        "The power of Christ is not finally frustrated by his tears."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly link the 'glory of God' in the text to the 'two natures'—how the human tears and divine command work together in one Person."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1150 words, the sermon lasts about 11-12 minutes. This is significantly below Dekker's 20-minute minimum. The lack of length correlates with the lack of exegetical depth.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section (Thesis 2) and the concrete application (Thesis 3) to reach the 20-minute threshold required for 'breadth'."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short primarily in its brevity and lack of rigorous exegesis. It relies on poetic speculation ('dictionary of eternity') rather than the 'Hebrew and Greek' scholarship Dekker demands. While it captures the psychological tension of the Gospel, it fails to present the 'two ways' with sufficient gravity and misses the specific uniqueness of the Lazarus pericope.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective use of psychological 'attraction and repulsion' to describe the encounter with Christ.",
      "Strong Christocentric focus, positioning Christ as the only way to see the Father.",
      "Avoids a dry, partitioned structure by weaving the narrative with contemporary reflection."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (approx. 11 minutes) prevents the 'breadth' required for theological depth.",
      "Speculative exegesis replaces scholarly exposition of the text's original context.",
      "Lack of the 'seriousness of being lost'; the conclusion is overly optimistic and general."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an incomplete sermon. While it contains elements of 'exposition and application', it lacks the 'breadth' and 'specific biblical uniqueness' required to be a 'form of the Word of God' in Dekker's sense. It is more of a devotional reflection than a robust sermon."
