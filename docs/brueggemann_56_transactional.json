    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' common in homiletics. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, respecting the listeners' professional and intellectual autonomy. While it introduces a 'Parental' voice of accountability, it does so through the metaphor of 'bread' rather than through personal judgment or shame. The preacher avoids the Drama Triangle by positioning both himself and the audience as fellow-travelers (lepers/disciples) rather than as heroes or victims.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'haunting' imagery could lean toward a guilt-based Gimmick if overemphasized.",
      "The use of Jesus' 'weary exasperation' could be misinterpreted as a Critical Parent stance."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I propose/I suggest' language. Ensure that the 'accountability to the poor' is presented as an invitation to meaning (Free Child/Adult) rather than a burden of debt (Adapted Child)."
