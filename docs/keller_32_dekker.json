    "sermon_start_end": "We’re looking at the life of David, and this episode is a strange one for modern readers. It’s a strange one. One of the very first things David does after he becomes king is he wants to bring the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem. [...] Lord, every time we get a deeper insight into how lost we are, we can turn that. We’re not afraid of that. We’re not afraid of all these passages that talk about how holy you are and your judgment. No, because it just shows us Jesus Christ took all of that for us, and now your grace shines more brightly, your love becomes more real to us, and we can dance."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon adheres closely to the pericope of 2 Samuel 6. It identifies the unique tension of this text: the sudden death of Uzzah contrasted with the blessing of Obed-Edom. It avoids generalities by focusing on the specific narrative arc of David's transformation.",
      "quotes": [
        "The message of this passage is as seminal and as central to the Bible as any other passage anywhere.",
        "One is, first of all, the death of Uzzah... Then the ark is given to Obed-Edom... Finally, he brings the ark of the covenant into Jerusalem."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the specificity by exploring why *this* specific incident of Uzzah's death (the 'stumbling oxen') is unique compared to other 'holy war' or 'judgment' texts in the Old Testament."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher utilizes scholarly insights (Robert Alter) and explains the cultic significance of the Ark. However, the exegesis is somewhat subservient to a systematic 'gospel' framework rather than letting the historical-critical difficulties of the text breathe on their own.",
      "quotes": [
        "Robert Alter, who is a Jewish expert on ancient Hebrew narrative... says we actually don’t know how to exactly translate some of these.",
        "In shame and honor cultures, kings had to be remote and intimidating."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Provide more depth on the 'linen ephod' and the specific cultic regulations of the Levites to ground the 'rules' in Israel's history rather than just as a foil for 'bad theology'."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application regarding 'worship' is psychologically insightful (referencing David Foster Wallace) but remains somewhat abstract. It identifies the 'zeitgeist' of self-worship but lacks concrete examples of how this manifests in the specific social or political life of the congregation.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you worship money and things... then you will never have enough.",
        "Worship power and you will end up feeling weak and afraid."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the 'default settings' of general idols (money, power) to concrete contemporary situations where the 'dignity' of the modern person is challenged by the holiness of God."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon successfully avoids the 'lecture-then-moral' structure. The exposition of the Ark's movement is constantly mirrored by the psychological and spiritual state of David and the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "That’s how you change. That’s what changed him. He worshiped. How did he get there?",
        "This God is more holy and more dangerous than I thought he was."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'application' doesn't always resolve into a general 'gospel summary' but stays tied to the specific movement of the narrative."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "The sermon is a textbook example of thinking from misery (Uzzah/holiness), redemption (the mercy seat/sacrifice), and gratitude (David's dancing). It avoids over-objectification by focusing on David's inner change.",
      "quotes": [
        "I am more lost and I am worse than I thought, but the fact that God still wants to deal with me... means his grace is greater than I thought.",
        "That gave him the joy. That made him dance."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The 'misery' could be even more radical; the preacher softens Uzzah's death slightly by explaining it as a 'message' rather than a terrifying encounter with the Absolute."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are present in the contrast between David (life/dance) and Michal (fruitlessness/alienation). The seriousness of being 'lost' is addressed through the lens of Uzzah.",
      "quotes": [
        "Michal daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death... she was fruitless.",
        "Uzzah has no concept of how lost he is."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'temporal loss' of Michal more explicit as a warning for the modern hearer who prioritizes 'dignity' over God."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The preacher moves from the Old Testament shadow (the mercy seat) to the New Testament reality (Hebrews/the cross) effectively. Grace is the final word.",
      "quotes": [
        "The ark of the covenant has been fulfilled in the gospel of Jesus Christ.",
        "Jesus was the sacrifice to end all sacrifices."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid making the transition to Christ too 'automatic'. Let the tension of the Old Testament text remain unresolved for a moment longer before introducing the New Testament solution."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "With an estimated duration of 34 minutes, the sermon provides the 'breadth' required for 'depth' according to Miskotte. It takes time to explore the narrative and the theological implications.",
      "improvement_point": "None. The length is adequate for the complexity of the subject."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong, substantively grounded piece that follows the formal requirements of Dekker's theses. It fails slightly in making the application truly concrete for the contemporary social context, often retreating into general psychological categories. However, its movement from the specific text to the Trinitarian reality of misery, redemption, and gratitude is traceable and effective.",
    "strengths": [
      "Rigorous adherence to the specific Bible passage as the source of the sermon's logic.",
      "Strong interwovenness of narrative exposition and spiritual application.",
      "Clear Christocentric telos that emerges from the text's own cultic imagery (the Ark/Mercy Seat)."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Application remains somewhat general (money, power, intellect) rather than addressing specific contemporary 'zeitgeist' manifestations.",
      "The exegesis occasionally feels like a 'set-up' for a pre-determined systematic gospel presentation."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It treats the Bible as the Word of God, maintains the necessary length for depth, and centers on the 'one Lord' through the lens of human 'misery, redemption, and gratitude'."
