    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon starts with an artistic/liturgical observation rather than a personal human experience. While it mentions 'Christian art' and 'lambs standing up with flags,' these are external objects rather than shared internal experiences. The strongest moment of concrete experience is the imaginative reconstruction of the Passover night, though this remains a historical-imaginative exercise rather than a contemporary 'slice of life.' The hearer's life world is addressed primarily through the lens of 'churchgoers' rather than their secular daily existence.",
      "quotes": [
        "Around the world, wherever there has been Christian art, there have been lambs.",

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon performs well in analyzing the human condition, specifically the 'myth of human moral progress.' It pauses to ask why the 'Lamb' image is misunderstood today, citing cultural bias and lack of biblical knowledge. It offers a sober critique of 20th-century history (Auschwitz) to dismantle superficial optimism. However, it moves quite quickly from the 'problem' of sin to the theological solution without allowing the hearer to sit long in the tension of their own specific failures.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest quadrant. The preacher provides a masterclass in biblical-theological synthesis, connecting the Conquering Lamb (Enoch/Revelation), the Sacrificial Lamb (Levitical), the Passover Lamb (Exodus), and the Suffering Servant (Isaiah). The exegesis of 'ephapax' (once for all) and the 'Great Exchange' provides a robust logical framework. The 'big idea'—that God provides the sacrifice He requires—is clearly formulated and defended.",

        "The description of Jesus as the Lamb of God... is therefore a combination of the blood sacrifice for sin and the Passover Lamb for deliverance.",

      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is weak in concrete, practical application. The 'call to action' is almost entirely internal/cognitive: 'Behold' and 'Believe.' While theologically appropriate for the text, it lacks specific ethical handles for the hearer's Friday or Monday. The application remains in the realm of 'faith' and 'reception' without translating what 'new life and new righteousness' looks like in the context of the sins mentioned (racism, egomania).",
      "quotes": [

It effectively dismantles modern secular optimism through a sober Reflective Observation of human history. However, it falls short of a complete Kolb cycle due to a significant lack of Active Experimentation. The preacher assumes the role of an Advocate/Philosopher, providing a brilliant synthesis of biblical 'Lamb' imagery, but provides few practical handles for the hearer's daily life. It is perfectly suited for an 'Assimilating' learner but may leave 'Converging' and 'Accommodating' learners feeling that the sermon was an intellectual exercise rather than a life-changing encounter. The language is dignified and the structure is clear, making it a strong example of declarative preaching.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This is a high-quality, traditional sermon that prioritizes theological accuracy and biblical depth. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon—strong on thinking and reflection, but weak on doing. While this may be appropriate for a Maundy Thursday service where the 'action' is the subsequent liturgy and Eucharist, as a standalone piece of learning, it fails to complete the cycle. It successfully informs the mind and inspires the imagination, but stops short of equipping the hands. The priority for improvement is the development of the Pragmatic/Active quadrant."
