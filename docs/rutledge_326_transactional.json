  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 7,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically robust because it balances high-level Adult information with emotional resonance. It avoids direct shaming (CP) by using historical and collective examples of human failure. However, it relies on the 'helplessness' of the listener to make its theological point, which can reinforce a dependent Child ego state. The preacher's honesty about church failures prevents a 'Holier-than-thou' game.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult ego state provides intellectual respect for the listener.",
      "Avoids the 'I'm Only Trying to Help You' trap by acknowledging that the preacher also needs the sacrifice.",
      "Uses imagination (Free Child) to make ancient texts vivid."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Incapacity' theme (CP) is very heavy and could lead to a 'Why Bother' attitude in the listener.",
      "The transition from 'Historical Analysis' to 'Personal Appeal' is a sharp shift from Adult to Parent."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To further increase autonomy, invite the listener to reflect on how they see the 'Lamb' working in their own 'here-and-now' reality, rather than just accepting the preacher's definition of their helplessness."
