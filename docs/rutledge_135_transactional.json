    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The sermon avoids 'NIGYSOB' by defending Paul rather than attacking the congregation. It avoids 'ITHY' by not offering a 'fix' for the listeners' lives, but rather a historical narrative for reflection. The communication remains largely transparent."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exceptionally healthy example of Adult-to-Adult communication. It respects the listener's intelligence, provides historical data to correct biases, and uses the Nurturing Parent ego state to build a sense of community and continuity. While it does eventually pivot toward a call for financial/missionary commitment (building plans), it does so through the lens of 'partnership' and 'joy' rather than guilt or obligation. The psychological impact is one of empowerment and inclusion rather than dependency or shame.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult ego state provides high-quality information.",
      "Deconstructs harmful 'Critical Parent' stereotypes about the Apostle Paul.",
      "Promotes the 'Free Child' through the celebration of Lydia's character."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the building plans could be more direct to avoid a 'Bait and Switch' feel.",
      "Slightly more 'Free Child' spontaneity could balance the heavy 'Adult' historical data."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to address the congregation as 'Partners' and 'Friends.' To ensure zero ulterior transactions, be explicit when the historical narrative is being used as a model for current financial goals."
