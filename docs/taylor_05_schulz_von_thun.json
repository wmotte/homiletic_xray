(Psalm 97:2) Faithful and unchanging Father, we walk often with thy face hidden from our view. Our limitation of understanding often veils thy face from us; our weakness and wickedness often distort the [...] But now and again the mist parts. Now and then the clouds lift. Now and then we see a light piercing the darkness. And in that moment when we behold the ways and works of God, we know all is well, for righteousness and justice are the habitation of his throne. You and I live our days in that confidence.",

  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher operates with a clear exegetical focus on the polarity of Psalm 97:2. The 'Sache' is the hiddenness (Deus absconditus) versus the revealed justice of God. Theologically, the sermon leans on the transcendence of God, echoing Barthian themes of the 'infinite qualitative distinction' between time and eternity. However, the factual side remains somewhat general; while it cites J.D.M. Rourke and Hugh Walpole, it lacks a deep dive into the specific historical-critical context of the Psalm. The 'blue' side serves primarily as a scaffold for the existential 'green' and 'yellow' sides. It is highly comprehensible but avoids complex dogmatic distinctions, favoring a narrative-philosophical approach to the problem of theodicy.",

        "Could benefit from more specific Christological grounding (Barth's 'living Christ' as the center of the cloud).",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a high degree of intellectual honesty and emotional vulnerability. There is a clear 'Selbstenthüllung' regarding the preacher's own struggle with theodicy and the silence of God. The preacher does not speak from a pedestal of certainty but as a fellow-traveler in the 'swampland of bewilderment.' This authenticity is diaconal; it serves the congregation by validating their own doubts. The preacher admits to being 'impatient' with evil, which humanizes the office. There is no forced 'Selbstdarstellung' of a perfect believer; rather, the preacher presents as a 'wise seeker' who relies on 'remembered light.'",
      "quotes": [
        "I, for one, am impatient with the fact that evil is so often in the saddle.",
        "I confess that I do not follow clearly the reason why God allows great numbers of people to be exploited.",
        "Our souls then cry out for some explanation."

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive/Schizoid Hybrid. The preacher seeks closeness and harmony with the suffering (Depressive) but maintains a certain intellectual distance through the use of 'giantesque' language and philosophical inquiry (Schizoid).",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is subservient. The preacher uses personal struggle to point toward the 'Sache' of God's hiddenness.",
      "strengths": [
        "Honest admission of doubt and impatience.",
        "Avoids the 'hysterical' trap of over-sharing personal anecdotes."

        "The 'I' could be more explicitly grounded in the role of the 'witness' rather than just the 'thinker'.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'solidary.' The preacher uses 'we' and 'us' consistently, placing himself in the same boat as the congregation. There is a 'teaching' attitude that is not paternalistic but rather invitational. However, the 'yellow' side is somewhat muted by the high-register language; the preacher speaks 'at eye level' intellectually, but perhaps 'from above' rhetorically. The use of the Jewish congregation anecdote creates a bridge of empathy, defining the relationship between the church and the wider suffering world. There is little 'relationship noise,' as the tone matches the gravity of the subject matter.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The appeal is subtle, focusing more on 'Faith/Trust' (Zuspruch) than 'Action' (Anspruch). The primary appeal is to 'hold on' and 'recognize' the broken evidences of God's plan. In the theological sense, the sermon is heavy on the 'Law' of human limitation and the 'Gospel' of God's eventual justice. However, the 'red' side is weak in terms of concrete ethical direction. It moves the listener toward a state of 'confidence' (fides qua), but does not necessarily mobilize them. The ratio of Zuspruch to Anspruch is roughly 80:20, which is theologically sound for a sermon on Psalm 97 but may leave the 'Appeal Ear' feeling underfed.",
      "quotes": [
        "Hold on now, here is something new.",
        "You and I live our days in that confidence.",
        "Let heaven be thanked for those who feel a mysterious compulsion to enlist on the side of right."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Strongly weighted toward Zuspruch (Promise). The demand is merely to trust the promise.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Very low. The sermon avoids 'should' and 'must' in favor of 'is' and 'will'.",
      "strengths": [
        "Avoids cheap moralism in the face of tragedy.",
        "The appeal to 'confidence' is grounded in God's character, not human effort."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'red' side could be sharper regarding the 'mysterious compulsion' to act.",
        "The conclusion is somewhat abrupt; the 'confidence' could be more robustly applied to daily life."

    "dominant_side": "Green (Self-revelation of struggle) and Blue (Factual hiddenness).",
    "disruptions": "The main disruption is the shift from the 'swampland' of evil to the 'throne' of justice, which feels more like a leap of faith than a logical progression.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a solid, intellectually dignified sermon that successfully navigates the tension between the hiddenness and the righteousness of God. It avoids the pitfall of 'psychologization' by keeping God as the Acting Subject (Immink), even when God's actions are veiled. The preacher's use of the 'Green' side (self-revelation) is particularly effective because it is diaconal—it serves the congregation's own sense of bewilderment without becoming self-indulgent. Theologically, it aligns with Barthian themes of transcendence, though it lacks a strong 'Christological concentration.' The 'Yellow' side (relationship) is stable and solidary. The main weakness lies in the 'Red' side (appeal), which remains somewhat abstract. The 'Blue' side (factual) is clear but leans heavily on illustration rather than deep exegetical labor. It is a 'Satisfactory to Ample' performance that respects the mystery of the 'Sache'.",
    "barthian_warning": "Low risk. The sermon does not reduce God to human experience; it maintains the 'otherness' of God (Clouds and Darkness).",

      "Authentic handling of theodicy.",

      "Sharper ethical application of the 'confidence'.",
