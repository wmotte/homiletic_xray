    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in religious discourse. By operating primarily from the Adult ego state, the preacher invites the listener into a reflective, non-coercive space. The use of personal vulnerability (admitting to 'dreading' a duty) prevents the preacher from occupying a 'Rescuer' or 'Critical Parent' role. The transition from 'Duty' to 'Delight' is a classic TA move from the Adapted Child to the Free Child, facilitated by Adult insight. It promotes autonomy and reciprocity rather than dependency or guilt.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'I' statements and personal narratives that include internal conflict, as this models the Adult processing of reality and prevents the listener from feeling 'preached at' from a Parent position."
