    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates a high level of exegetical and philosophical competence. He effectively bridges the gap between the ancient text and contemporary psychological categories. The 'Sache' (the living Christ) is not introduced until the final third, but the groundwork is laid through a rigorous analysis of the human condition. He utilizes Aristotle and C.S. Lewis to bolster the 'blue' side, making the doctrine of sin intellectually respectable before transitioning to the dogmatic 'Sache' of the Gospel. The distinction between 'comparison, desire, and resentment' provides a clear, logical framework that satisfies the factual ear's need for structure. However, the connection between the 'harmful spirit from God' and the doctrine of judgment (Romans 1) is a dense theological move that requires close attention from the listener.",
      "quotes": [
        "Aristotle … understood envy is one of the deadly sins.",

        "The transition from the 'harmful spirit' to the 'equitable judge' could be perceived as a leap by less theologically trained listeners.",
        "Heavy reliance on external authorities (Aristotle, Lewis) may slightly overshadow the primary text."
      ],
      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The use of modern examples like 'clothes envy' and 'journalism' grounds the abstraction."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as a seasoned observer of the human soul—a 'pastor-doctor' figure. There is a controlled authenticity; he shares professional observations ('Over the years, I’ve had plenty of people come to me') rather than raw personal struggles. This creates a sense of authority and distance. The 'I' is strictly diaconal, serving as a guide through the text. There is an absence of 'hysterical' self-promotion. However, the lack of personal vulnerability regarding his own envy might make the sermon feel slightly 'from above.' The preacher appears as one who has diagnosed the problem, rather than one who is currently suffering from it alongside the congregation.",
      "quotes": [
        "Over the years, I’ve had plenty of people come to me to talk about issues like anger...",

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive/Schizoid. The preacher values structural correctness, logical progression, and maintains a professional distance. He uses the 'I' to establish credibility and order.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher-Student' or 'Doctor-Patient.' The preacher uses 'we' frequently to soften the blow of the critique, yet the 'you' remains the object of the diagnosis. There is a clear 'We-definition' of shared human frailty, but the preacher remains the one with the map. The tone is sober and analytical. The 'yellow' signals are generally congruent with the 'blue' content—he is serious because the topic is deadly. There is little 'relationship noise' in terms of aggression, though the intellectual rigor might be off-putting to those seeking purely emotional 'non-committal warmth' (Depressive type).",
      "quotes": [
        "We live in a culture that doesn’t really see envy as all that big of a problem.",
        "Did I make you feel bad enough yet about your envy? Okay. That’s my job. Now I want to make you feel better.",
        "Let us look at Jonathan. Will you come with me?"

      "relationship_noise_check": "Minimal. The preacher's self-awareness of 'making them feel bad' acts as a pressure-release valve for the relationship.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest side. The preacher masterfully navigates the Law/Gospel (Anspruch/Zuspruch) tension. He spends the first two-thirds on the 'Law' (the anatomy and destruction of envy), creating a 'vacuum' that only the 'Gospel' (the work of Christ) can fill. The appeal is not 'stop envying' (moralism), but 'look at Christ' (faith). This is a classic Barthian/Lutheran move: the demand is to abdicate, but the motivation is the beauty of the Gift. The risk of moralism is low because the preacher explicitly states that 'true love is hard' and requires a heart transformation that only the Gospel provides.",
      "quotes": [
        "The way to do that is not to look at Saul... let’s look at Jonathan.",
        "How can you be envious of anyone else when you know what you have and how you got it?",
        "The only way God’s salvation is going to come into your life is if you get off the throne."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Excellent. The 'Zuspruch' (Christ as the true Jonathan) is the foundation for the 'Anspruch' (Abdication).",

    "disruptions": "The main disruption is the 'intellectual hurdle'—the preacher demands high cognitive engagement, which may leave the 'Relational Ear' feeling slightly starved for warmth.",
    "healing_disruption": "Yes. The preacher disrupts the listener's cultural complacency regarding envy, labeling it a 'brain tumor' rather than a 'headache.' This is a prophetic disruption of the 'I'm okay, you're okay' mindset."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a sophisticated example of 'psychological homiletics' that remains tethered to Reformed orthodoxy. The preacher avoids the trap of mere moralism by using the Four-Sides-Model's 'Appeal' side to point toward the 'Sache' of the Gospel rather than human effort. By diagnosing envy through the lens of comparison, desire, and resentment, he engages the 'Factual Ear' and the 'Self-revelation Ear' (as a competent guide). The transition to Jonathan as a type of Christ (the 'True Jonathan') is a brilliant move that shifts the sermon from a psychological lecture to a theological proclamation. The 'Barthian' requirement—that God remains the acting Subject—is met in the final third, where the 'unenviousness of God' becomes the catalyst for change. The sermon's weakness lies in its clinical distance; it is a 'razor-sharp' analysis that may feel more like a classroom or a consulting room than a sanctuary to some. However, its communicative integrity is high, as the preacher's sober tone is perfectly congruent with his message of the 'deadliness' of envy and the 'freedom' of abdication.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a slight risk of 'psychologizing' the faith in the first half, but the preacher successfully pivots to the 'Extra Nos' (outside of us) work of Christ, avoiding a purely therapeutic gospel.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Masterful anatomy of a specific sin (Envy).",
      "Strong Christological typology (Jesus as the True Jonathan).",
      "High congruence between analytical tone and subject matter."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Increase relational warmth to engage the 'Yellow Ear'.",
      "Reduce reliance on secular quotes (Aristotle/Lewis) to let the Scripture breathe more.",
      "Provide more 'fides qua' (existential) connection to the preacher's own heart."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, ample satisfactory sermon (7.5) that excels in clarity and theological depth, though it leans heavily on the intellectual/factual side of the Schulz von Thun model."
