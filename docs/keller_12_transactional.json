    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically coercive. It employs a classic 'Bait and Switch' maneuver: it begins with empathy for human suffering but quickly pivots to a 'Critical Parent' stance that shames the listener for having natural expectations of fairness. By labeling the listener's motives as 'beastly' and 'pathetically self-centered,' the preacher creates a psychological deficit that only his specific 'Rescuer' message (the Gospel) can fill. This creates a cycle of dependency rather than promoting Adult autonomy or authentic Free Child joy.",

      "Heavy reliance on shaming language ('brute beast', 'pathetically self-centered').",
      "The 'Adult' ego of the listener is suppressed in favor of an 'Adapted Child' response."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Avoid using diagnostic labels to shame the listener's inner motives. Instead of telling the listener they are 'using God,' invite the Adult ego to reflect on the consequences of different priorities. Replace the 'Critical Parent' tone with an 'Adult-Adult' exploration of the text's wisdom."
