Anguish, because I only know three things about jazz: 1. Jazz arises among the disadvantaged who cannot afford to have things settled because they will [...] Shame on us. Listen once more to the beat: The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases, his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. (Lam. 3:22–23)"

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's first thesis fundamentally. It does not treat a specific passage but uses a 'biblical keyword' or 'biblical idea' (the 'jazz theme' of liberation). It is a thematic speech about the 'gospel' rather than an exposition of a unique text.",
      "quotes": [
        "One theme played over and over and over with amazing variation.",
        "I tell it to you for one reason only, that you may observe that not one of these great jazz artists in our past has moved a cubit away from the sounds of Miriam."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one pericope (e.g., Exodus 15:21) and find what is unique to that text alone, rather than flattening all of Scripture into a single recurring theme."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "While the preacher shows awareness of the historical context of the Exodus and the role of midwives, the exegesis is subordinated to the jazz metaphor. There is no evidence of engagement with Hebrew/Greek or specific biblical theology of the individual books cited.",
      "quotes": [
        "This nameless 'Lord of Egypt' who tries to stop the music...",
        "The sea is the residue of chaos, the anxious power of disorder and darkness."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond metaphorical descriptions of the 'barrio' and provide rigorous exposition of the socio-religious history of the specific text chosen."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the 'zeitgeist' (mentioning racial dynamics and institutional weariness), but it remains somewhat general in its call to 'get past themselves.' It borders on the 'general truths' Dekker forbids.",
      "quotes": [
        "The song is no comfort to whites who want old patterns of power and authority to be revived.",
        "we settle for committees, we pester to balance races, we doubt, and in doubt grow weary"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the application directly to the specific demands of a single text rather than a general critique of church culture."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is well-interwoven. The preacher does not separate 'then' and 'now' into blocks; the text is 'actualized' through the jazz metaphor throughout the entire delivery.",
      "quotes": [
        "The babies watched the women that day. They looked to the edge of the campsite and they saw the new land of freedom..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'interweaving' is based on the text's own logic rather than an external metaphor (jazz) imposed upon it."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The categories are present: Pharaoh/Empire (misery), the God who throws horse and rider (redemption), and the dance/song (gratitude). However, the 'misery' is often more sociological than theological (misery before God).",
      "quotes": [
        "...end of brick quotas, end of fear, end of anxiety, end of greed, end of alienation!",
        "Shame on us, church, for reducing the lyric of newness to the staleness of our predictable slogans."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are present in the contrast between the 'empire' and the 'barrio,' but the seriousness of being 'lost' is largely temporal/political. The ultimate possibility of destruction is softened by the celebratory tone.",
      "quotes": [
        "The world is going to die in its strength. Our society is going to commit disaster in its wisdom.",
        "If you think you are smart enough to have it your own way, consider your call."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the 'telos,' but the sermon is more 'Theocentric' in a general sense. Christ appears as one 'variation' among many rather than the unique, necessary goal of the specific text.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is about the one who has made all things new...",
        "the truth of God that impinges upon the world come close in Jesus"
      ],

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon likely hits the 20-minute mark, but it lacks 'breadth' because it repeats the same theme through many texts rather than going deep into one. It sacrifices depth for a survey of 'variations.'",
      "quotes": [
        "I will see if that is enough to last for these twenty minutes or so."

      "improvement_point": "Reduce the number of quoted texts and increase the depth of analysis for one specific passage."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily because it lacks a specific biblical passage as its foundation. It functions as a thematic 'speech' about the Gospel using jazz as a metaphor, which Dekker explicitly classifies as 'not a sermon.' While it is concrete in its cultural analysis and effectively interweaves its theme, it flattens the diversity of Scripture into a single 'recurring theme,' thereby missing the unique word that a specific text has to offer.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective interwovenness of exposition and application.",
      "Concrete contemporary application regarding the 'zeitgeist' of the church and society.",
      "Strong sense of 'gratitude' as a theological category."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of a specific pericope; the sermon is a survey of biblical ideas.",
      "Subordination of biblical exegesis to a secular metaphor (jazz).",
      "Insufficient treatment of the 'two ways' in terms of the seriousness of being lost."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "According to Dekker’s definition, this is not a sermon because it lacks a specific Bible passage as its starting point. It is a theological speech that treats the Bible as a collection of variations on a general theme rather than the Word of God in a specific, current, proclamatory word."
