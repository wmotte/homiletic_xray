      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively facilitates concrete experience by tapping into universal existential anxieties. It moves beyond abstract theology to the 'feeling' of being alone in the universe. However, it lacks specific, contemporary 'slices of life' or modern narrative illustrations, relying instead on generalized human conditions and biblical characters.",
      "quotes": [
        "Is there anybody here except us 'chickens,' so to speak?",
        "Some of us cannot repeat those words without a catch in the throat, the mist of a tear in the eye, and a bit of a stab in the heart"

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon pauses to explore the 'why' behind Philip's request and the human need for God. It analyzes the human condition as one of 'essential anxiety.' However, the reflection is somewhat narrow, focusing almost exclusively on the emotional/existential dimension rather than a broader cultural or social critique.",
      "quotes": [
        "We wonder sometimes if we are orphans with no one who watches over us and no one who cares about us.",

The exegesis is solid but leans heavily on traditional interpretation and rhetorical lists rather than systematic theological development.",

        "The words Jesus said then are the most stupendous, most gigantic, most far-reaching... 'He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.'",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of visionary and declarative preaching that fails to achieve homiletical integrality due to a lack of pragmatic application. It begins effectively by grounding the biblical text in universal human experience (Concrete Experience) and exploring the psychological motivations of the disciples (Reflective Observation). The theological center (Abstract Conceptualization) is clear and rhetorically powerful, successfully communicating the Johannine high Christology. However, the sermon remains in the realm of 'inspiration' and 'truth-claims' without ever transitioning into 'action-steps' (Active Experimentation). The concluding litany, while aesthetically impressive, reinforces a passive, future-oriented hope rather than an active, present-day transformation. Consequently, the learning cycle is left incomplete, favoring the diverging and assimilating learners while neglecting the converging and accommodating learners who require concrete handles for implementation.",

      "Ask: 'If the congregation believes this truth, what is the first thing they should do when they leave?'"
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a rhetorically effective piece of 'Visionary' preaching that succeeds in comforting the heart and informing the mind. From a Kolb perspective, however, it is incomplete. It masterfully handles the movement from experience to reflection and theological conceptualization but stops short of the necessary 'active experimentation' that characterizes adult learning and holistic discipleship. The priority for improvement is the development of the pragmatic quadrant—translating the 'bedrock faith' into 'daily practice'. Without this, the sermon risks becoming a beautiful but abstract exercise in religious sentimentality."
