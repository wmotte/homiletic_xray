    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the manipulative 'games' often found in Lenten preaching. By defining repentance as 'insight' rather than 'groveling,' the preacher addresses the listener's Adult ego. He successfully dismantles the 'Adapted Child' performance (the 'charade of pretense') and replaces it with a secure 'Nurturing Parent' framework (God’s love). The use of 'we' instead of 'you' prevents a Persecutor/Victim dynamic, fostering a community of mutual transparency.",

      "Deconstruction of religious pretense (Adapted Child).",
      "Definition of repentance as cognitive insight (Adult).",
      "Avoidance of 'us vs. them' dynamics (Anti-NIGYSOB)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The heavy use of 'wretchedness' in the liturgical prayer at the end slightly contradicts the Adult-Adult tone of the sermon body.",
      "Could further explore the 'Free Child's' response to being forgiven."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to lead with the 'Knowledge of Grace' before the 'Confession of Sin' to ensure the listener stays in the Adult/Free Child position rather than retreating into a fearful Adapted Child state."
