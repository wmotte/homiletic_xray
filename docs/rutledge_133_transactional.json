    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, providing historical and textual evidence while inviting the listeners into a Free Child appreciation of the story. By framing 'Redemption' as something that happens through 'simple human means' rather than divine intervention that bypasses human agency, the preacher promotes autonomy and responsibility. The sermon avoids the Drama Triangle by refusing to cast the congregation as helpless victims or the preacher as an all-knowing rescuer.",
    "strengths": [

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the Christological conclusion is slightly abrupt, moving from Adult observation to a more traditional Parent-led dogma, though it remains gentle."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' ego state to deconstruct complex theological concepts into 'here-and-now' human experiences, as this prevents the formation of dependency and 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' dynamics."
