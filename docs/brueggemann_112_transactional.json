  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and remarkably game-free. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, inviting the congregation into a mature, reality-based reflection on the limits of human control. By identifying with the listeners ('we') and acknowledging the shared anxiety of a changing world, the preacher avoids the 'Critical Parent' trap of moralizing. The shift from the 'Drama Triangle' (where we are victims of change) to a state of 'dazzled' autonomy is handled with theological and psychological sophistication.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "Avoids the 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' trap by not offering easy answers.",
      "Promotes autonomy by encouraging listeners to let go of 'management' and 'control'."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Ain't It Awful' section regarding modern institutions could be expanded to ensure it doesn't just foster passivity.",
      "Could incorporate more 'Free Child' spontaneity to balance the heavy Adult analysis."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'we' to maintain the Adult-Adult transaction. Ensure that the 'Nurturing Parent' comfort at the end doesn't inadvertently encourage 'Adapted Child' dependency, but rather fuels the 'Free Child's' capacity for new life."
