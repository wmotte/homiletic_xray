    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exceptionally healthy example of Adult-to-Adult communication in a religious context. The preacher avoids the common trap of the 'Critical Parent' who demands faith in the face of suffering. Instead, he validates the 'Child's' fear and the 'Adult's' skepticism. By admitting his own impatience and confusion regarding the Holocaust and systemic racism, he levels the playing field, removing the 'Rescuer' mask. The movement from 'Clouds' to 'Righteousness' is presented not as a dogmatic certainty, but as a perceived 'nudge' or 'broken evidence' that the listener is free to evaluate.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the horror of the Holocaust to 'broken evidences of a plan' could feel too fast for a listener in deep trauma.",
      "Slight reliance on 'Parental' poetic authority to bridge the gap of the unknown."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements when discussing doubt. This models for the congregation that one can be a person of faith while maintaining a functioning, questioning Adult ego state."
