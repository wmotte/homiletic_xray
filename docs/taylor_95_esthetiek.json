    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating sensory contrast. Taylor utilizes what Paul Scott Wilson calls 'painting the picture' by juxtaposing the 'soft lights' and 'mystic fellowship' of the Upper Room with the 'sweat, screams, and curses' of the Mount of Olives. This is not mere decoration; the imagery serves a theological 'reframing' (Cilliers), forcing the hearer to see the Gospel not as a static, comfortable interior scene, but as a movement into the 'torch light' of a 'dastardly business.' The imagery of the 'lynch rope dangling from trees' provides a visceral, historical weight that prevents the sermon from floating into abstraction. The use of 'stare us in the face and stab us in the heart' immediately establishes a physical, piercing relationship between the text and the listener.",
      "quotes": [
        "death has cast a hush and eerie stillness over our homes",
        "the arresting party had begun its ominous journey by torch light",

        "Masterful use of sensory contrast (quiet vs. violent)",

        "Some metaphors like 'raided the kingdoms' could be further developed into a sustained image",

        "Occasional reliance on 'vast and mysterious' (telling) where the imagery could be even sharper"
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strongly weighted toward 'showing.' The preacher describes the atmosphere and the physical sensations of the scenes rather than just stating their theological significance."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Taylor’s language is sophisticated and precise, avoiding 'Canaanite' jargon in favor of a high-rhetorical style that McEntyre would describe as 'stewardship of language.' He uses words like 'trenchant,' 'delineate,' and 'benighted' with surgical accuracy. However, there is a slight tendency toward the 'monumental' style (e.g., 'incalculably splendid,' 'massive and monumental production'), which occasionally risks obscuring the simplicity of the Gospel message. The precision is most effective when describing the 'abominable and contemptible political arrangements' of history, where the language does justice to the complexity of the injustice described.",
      "quotes": [
        "the accidents of history have rendered us in an awkward posture of power",
        "the systematic exclusion of a whole section of the population",

        "Reduction of superlative adjectives (e.g., 'stupendous,' 'incalculably') to allow the nouns more weight",

        "Slightly less 'academic' phrasing in the transitions between historical anecdotes"

      "jargon_analysis": "Theological jargon is minimal; instead, the preacher uses academic and political language that is clearly contextualized within the narrative."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 9,
      "analysis": "The sermon is a rhythmic tour de force. Taylor employs classical rhetorical devices—parallelism, alliteration, and anaphora—to create a 'cadence' that is essentially oral. The repetition of 'equal in...' and 'we have built our communities upon...' creates a liturgical flow that Immink would identify as 'the holy happening' through the performance of the word. The sentence structure varies from short, punchy declarations to long, flowing periods that build toward a climax. It is clearly 'ear language,' designed to be felt as much as heard, mirroring the 'hymn' mentioned in the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Equal in guilt, equal in the sufficiency... Equal in their destiny.",
        "not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit",
        "no center of power, that no systemic bigotry, that no fortress of reaction, that no long endured institution of oppression"

      "strengths": [
        "Exceptional use of rhythmic repetition (anaphora)",
        "Variation in sentence length that creates a natural 'breathing' for the listener",
        "Musicality that mirrors the 'marching song' theme of the conclusion"
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition into the Paul Tillich quote slightly breaks the rhythmic flow",
        "The opening sentence is somewhat long for an oral start",
        "Ensure the 'alleluia' section doesn't become too staccato compared to the rest"
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Purely oral language. The text is clearly written for the voice, with a palpable sense of breath and timing."
    },
    "average_score_language": 8.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' and rhythmic power. It avoids the kitsch of easy sentimentality by using sharp, historical precision and vivid, often painful, imagery. The musicality of the prose elevates the sermon from a lecture to a performance, where the form itself—the movement from the 'hymn' to the 'mount'—is embodied in the cadence of the sentences. It is a high-style stewardship of language that respects both the biblical text and the contemporary crisis."
  },
  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium'—the stabbing realization that the hymn leads to the Mount of Olives. The tension is maintained by exploring the 'other facet' of the Gospel: the move from intimacy to violence. The turning point is Calvary, reframed not as a defeat but as a 'new standard of judgment' and a 'new fellowship.' The movement from the Upper Room (past) to the Civil Rights struggle (present) to the 'overcome someday' (future) provides a compelling narrative journey that keeps the energy high until the final prayer.",
      "quotes": [
        "The only trouble is that the Gospel does not end there.",
        "But the truth of the matter is that even though there was flight, that place of Calvary became the rallying point",
        "They went out from singing a hymn to bring to pass these things."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear movement from the 'intimate' to the 'public' sphere",
        "Effective use of the 'hymn' as a recurring motif to anchor the structure",
        "Strong 'upsetting' opening that immediately engages the listener"
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The section on the 'President of the United States' is slightly long and could be more tightly integrated into the Calvary arc",
        "The transition to Paul Tillich feels a bit like a 'theological detour'",
        "The conclusion could return more explicitly to the 'Mount of Olives' imagery to close the circle"
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey from the 'garret room' to the 'streets of Philadelphia,' moving through the 'levelness of Calvary.'"
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 9,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. Taylor achieves a profound 'reframing' (Cilliers) by mapping the 'bloodshed and screams' of the Passion onto the 'lynch rope' and 'police vans' of the 1960s. The biblical text is not a 'springboard' but a lens through which contemporary history is interpreted. He respects the 'strangeness' of the Gospel—that it is illegal and illicit—and uses that to challenge the 'anxiety for respectability' in his context. The integration of the Hayes-Tilden decision and the New York protests makes the 'timeless Gospel' urgently 'timely.'",
      "quotes": [
        "we are spiritual heirs of a society which was illegal and which was declared by the empire to be a society illicit",
        "that place of Calvary became the rallying point of a new fellowship",
        "In 1901 Charles Tindley wrote words that have rung across the length and breadth of the nation."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Organic synthesis of biblical narrative and civil rights struggle",
        "Reframing of 'Calvary' as a political and social judgment, not just a private one",
        "Honoring the 'strangeness' of the early church to challenge modern complacency"
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection between 'material power' and 'chariots' could be updated with more specific 1960s technological references",
        "More direct application to the 'convention' listeners' specific daily lives beyond the broad political movement",
        "A brief mention of the 'hymn' they actually sang (the Hallel) could deepen the biblical integration"
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing. Reality is seen through the lens of the 'levelness of Calvary,' which deconstructs racial and economic hierarchies."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is rhetorically powerful, it leans toward a 'closed' structure in its moral and political certainty. It functions more as a 'witness' (Long) than an 'open work of art' (Stark). The conclusions are definitive: 'we had better learn that lesson, and quickly!' However, there is an aesthetic 'openness' in the mystery of the 'other sheep' and the 'spiritual presence' felt outside the church. The ending, while hopeful, acknowledges that the 'end' lies beyond our capacity to understand, leaving a small space for the 'unavailable' (Cilliers).",
      "quotes": [
        "they lie beyond our capacity to interpret or understand",
        "Some of them are not a part of any church. They are, as Jesus called them, other sheep.",
        "We had better learn that lesson, and quickly!"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Inclusion of 'other sheep' creates a polyvalent view of God's work",
        "Acknowledgment of the 'mystery' of the Gospel's ultimate end",
        "Invitation to a 'new fellowship' that is broader than the current reality"
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The tone is occasionally more 'prescriptive' than 'invitational'",
        "The 'happy ending' of 'We Shall Overcome' could be tempered with the ongoing 'sweat and screams' to maintain the tension",
        "More room for the 'ambivalence' of those who fled at Calvary (the disciples) as a mirror for the listener"
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent and declarative, though it opens up toward the end regarding the 'mystery' of God's providence."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.67,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are dominated by a powerful narrative arc that bridges the gap between the first century and the twentieth. The sermon is a 'performance' of the Gospel's movement from the private to the public. While it is rhetorically 'closed' in its prophetic denunciations, it opens a vast 'space for grace' by redefining fellowship at the 'levelness of Calvary.' The structure is not a static list of points but a 'marching' movement that carries the listener toward a hopeful, yet demanding, future."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully avoids religious kitsch by refusing to offer 'immediate comfort without taking the pain of suffering seriously' (Cilliers). It explicitly rejects the 'lovely intimacy' and 'soft lights' as the exclusive quality of the Gospel. By introducing the 'stench' of history—lynching, bigoted trials, and political betrayals—it grounds emotion in authentic struggle rather than sentimentality. The 'happy ending' (We Shall Overcome) is earned through the 'dark night' of the Hayes-Tilden decision, not pasted on as a cliché.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential kitsch of the 'lovely intimacy' in the Upper Room is immediately deconstructed by the preacher.",
      "The 'soft lights' and 'steadying hand' are presented as a temptation to be overcome."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'lynch rope' as a historical reality that the Gospel must address.",
      "The admission that 'not a single vote was cast for Jesus' on Friday, acknowledging total failure."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the tension between the 'hymn' and the 'Mount' even in the conclusion to ensure the 'overcoming' doesn't feel too easy."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened by the 'levelness of Calvary,' which acts as a deconstructive force against human hierarchies. Taylor creates a 'space for grace' by showing that redemption is available even to the 'other sheep' and those who fled. However, the space is somewhat narrowed by a strong moral imperative ('We had better learn...'). The 'mystery' of God's 'divine conspiracy' provides the necessary aesthetic 'between' (Cilliers) where grace can operate beyond human effort.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'already' of the hymn and the 'not yet' of the liberation is well-sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "The sermon concludes by admitting that God's purposes are 'incalculably splendid' and 'beyond our capacity to interpret.'",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails as the foundation ('equal in the sufficiency'), but moralization is strong in the application to the nation's 'arrogance.'",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'openness' of the 'other sheep' to linger longer before moving to the 'we must' of the application."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a masterful example of the 'Aesthetic Turn' applied to the prophetic tradition. It rejects the 'kitsch' of a purely vertical, private revelation (Thurneysen) in favor of a sensory, historical 'performance' (Immink) of the Word. The poetics of language are exceptionally strong, utilizing rhythm and imagery to 'reframe' (Cilliers) the cross not as a religious symbol, but as a standard of judgment in history. The sermon functions as an 'event' that moves the hearer from the 'soft lights' of the sanctuary to the 'torch light' of social responsibility. While it leans toward a declarative and authoritative 'witness' style (Long) rather than an 'open work' (Stark), its aesthetic depth is found in its refusal to simplify the 'agony' of the Gospel commitment.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional rhythmic and musical quality of the prose.",
      "Profound integration of biblical 'strangeness' with contemporary historical crisis.",
      "Successful deconstruction of religious kitsch in favor of authentic 'blood and sweat' theology."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduce the density of superlative adjectives to increase the 'sober beauty' of the nouns.",
      "Create more 'interpretive space' for the hearer by using more open-ended questions.",
      "Tighten the integration of academic quotes (Tillich/Scherer) into the oral flow."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Rhythmic (Black Homiletic Tradition)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Anti-kitsch) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Four Pages).",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers seeking a connection between faith and justice; those moved by high rhetorical style and historical narrative.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'staccato' section to mirror the violence of the Mount of Olives.",
      "Use a single, sustained metaphor for 'material power' to contrast with the 'Cross'.",
      "End with an image rather than a moral imperative to increase 'openness'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust 'happening' that honors the 'stewardship of language.' It avoids the pitfalls of both dry intellectualism and shallow emotionalism. By 'painting the picture' of the transition from the hymn to the mount, Taylor creates a space where the 'holy happens' in the intersection of ancient text and modern struggle. It is a high-caliber example of homiletic aesthetics where the form (the march) perfectly embodies the content (the timely Gospel)."
