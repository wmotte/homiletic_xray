At the very beginning we hear the proclamation that the light of the incarnate Word of God comes to shine in the darkness (1:5). Repeatedly in this gospel, Jesus teaches that he brings light to the world [...] Open, we pray thee, the eyes of our faith, that we may behold him in all his redeeming work; through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The text treats three distinct pericopes as a series rather than one specific passage. While it respects the narrative arc of John 20 and Job 42, it tends toward 'general truths' about darkness and light rather than identifying what is unique to these specific verses that cannot be found elsewhere.",
      "quotes": [
        "The symbolism of night and darkness pervades the Gospel of John.",
        "The book of Job is asking this great question: Is there a living God beyond what we can imagine?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus on a single pericope. Avoid thematic links (darkness/light) that could apply to the whole Johannine corpus, and isolate the 'unique' element of the specific text."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher shows awareness of the literary structure (John as 'master dramatist') and the Jewish context of burial. However, the exegesis is often subservient to the thematic development of 'night' rather than a rigorous linguistic or historical-critical exposition.",
      "quotes": [
        "as is the burial custom of the Jews",
        "The mythology of the Greeks and Romans is by no means wrong here",
        "One respected modern translator puts it this way: 'I will be quiet, comforted that I am dust.'"

    "3_application_concrete_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest element. It avoids vague moralism and addresses the 'zeitgeist' of trauma and skepticism, specifically using the 1994 Alabama tornado to ground the theology of doubt.",
      "quotes": [
        "the death of a friendship, the death of a career, the loss of youth, the loss of health",
        "In 1994, a church in Piedmont, Alabama, was destroyed by a tornado on Palm Sunday morning."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a pattern of 'textual summary followed by modern illustration.' The hearer is not always 'drawn into the text' in one movement; rather, the text is used as a springboard for reflections on grief and doubt.",
      "quotes": [
        "Have you buried someone? If you haven’t, you will.",
        "Thomas stands for all of us here."

      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The category of 'misery' is handled with significant psychological depth. Redemption is correctly placed outside the human subject (grace). Gratitude is less explicit but implied in the liturgical responses.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is the night of the end of human hope.",
        "The rising sun revealed the victory already accomplished.",

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are largely absent. While 'being lost' in grief is discussed, the ultimate seriousness of the choice between life and destruction (temporal or eternal) is softened by a focus on comfort.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have a real choice. We can choose a god who suits us... or the Bible sets before us a baffling... God."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,

    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon (or series) succeeds in psychological application and Christocentric focus but falls short of Dekker's requirement for a single, specific Bible passage. It relies heavily on thematic 'symbolism' (night/light) which risks turning the sermon into a general speech about the Gospel rather than an exposition of what *this* text says that is found nowhere else. The 'two ways' are underdeveloped, favoring comfort over the radical choice of life or death.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong psychological connection to the 'misery' of the hearer without becoming secular psychology.",
      "Clear Christological focus, maintaining the necessity of Christ's divinity and humanity (the wounds).",
      "Effective use of concrete contemporary examples (Alabama tornado) to illustrate the reality of doubt."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specificity: the sermon treats broad themes rather than the unique 'nowhere else' point of the pericope.",
      "Insufficient emphasis on the 'two ways' and the seriousness of being lost.",
      "Structural separation between the biblical narrative and the application."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate homiletic exercise that approaches the status of a sermon, but it remains too thematic and 'general' to fully satisfy Dekker's strict formal definition. It functions more as a theological meditation on Easter themes than a specific 'recreation' of a Bible passage into a current, proclamatory word."
