    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically robust because it avoids the typical 'Rescuer' trap of many sermons. By placing the 'Afterward' in God's hands and calling for 'Adult' resolve rather than 'Child' compliance, it promotes autonomy. However, the heavy use of the 'Whore' metaphor and 'Wrath' imagery (Critical Parent) risks triggering shame-based responses in the listener.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To further minimize games, the preacher could invite more 'Free Child' creativity—specific, joyful examples of what fidelity looks like in the 'here-and-now' to balance the heavy 'Critical Parent' judgment."
