    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. While it offers high levels of comfort (Nurturing Parent), it does so by infantilizing the listener and utilizing guilt to suppress the Adult's natural response to suffering (doubt). By framing doubt as a personal injury to God, it creates a 'Double Bind' where the listener's honest reality-testing (Adult) is labeled as a moral failure (Child).",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Acknowledge doubt as a valid Adult data-processing step rather than a 'sting' to God. Invite the congregation to reflect on their own history of resilience (Adult) rather than just their history of being rescued (Child)."
