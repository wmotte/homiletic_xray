  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically exceptionally healthy. It avoids the common pulpit trap of the Critical Parent ('You must do more') and instead operates from an Adult-Adult position. By emphasizing that 'God prepares the way,' the preacher relieves the listener of the 'Adapted Child' burden of performance. The use of the Drama Triangle is avoided because the preacher refuses to play the Rescuer, pointing instead to a higher power while validating the listener's current state. The inclusion of the developmentally disabled Joseph as a 'hero' of the faith further dismantles hierarchy and promotes psychological equality.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult ego position that respects the listener's intelligence.",

      "The 'Nurturing Parent' tone could occasionally be perceived as slightly sentimental, which might invite a 'Child' response in very cynical listeners."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Watchman' metaphor, as it perfectly balances Adult observation with Free Child hope without falling into Parent-driven demands."
