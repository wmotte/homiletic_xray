        "analysis": "Coercion is masked as 'pedagogical disappointment.' The preacher uses 'must' and labels the disciples (and by extension the listener) as 'resistant,' 'recalcitrant,' and 'dull.'",

      "presence": "Medium",
      "analysis": "The listener is addressed as a student in a 'weekend seminar,' but the 'Adult' data processing is hijacked by the Parent's disappointment when the 'correct' conclusion isn't reached immediately.",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically coercive. It utilizes a 'Pedagogical Shaming' technique where the preacher identifies with the 'Lordly' perspective of Jesus and looks down upon the 'dull' disciples. By equating the disciples with the 'church,' the preacher creates a 'NIGYSOB' dynamic: if the listener feels any anxiety about money or life, they are 'hard-hearted' and 'jaded.' The 'abundance' offered is not a gift but a demand for a specific psychological state, which ironically increases the anxiety it claims to cure.",

      "Strong narrative flow and vivid imagery.",
      "Effective use of the 'four verbs' to connect liturgy to life."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The preacher's 'Adult' ego is weak; it is mostly a 'Critical Parent' in a teacher's robe.",
      "The sermon lacks empathy for the 'Child's' legitimate fears in a world of actual scarcity."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Stop using the disciples' lack of understanding as a weapon against the congregation. Instead of asking 'Do you not yet get it?' (Parent->Child), try 'How do we, in our real-world struggles, relate to this vision of abundance?' (Adult->Adult). Move from 'I'm disappointed in you' to 'We are in this together.'"
