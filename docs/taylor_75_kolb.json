    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a strong metaphor of the 'haunted house' to ground the listener's experience. It effectively uses recognizable emotional states—sorrow, sickness, and disappointment—to create identification. However, the 'concrete' nature of these experiences remains somewhat general; while the 'great fire' is mentioned, most other experiences are listed as categories rather than vivid, specific scenes that the hearer can inhabit.",
      "quotes": [
        "Think of your life as a house, and reflect on how many tenants live in that residence.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Reflection is present primarily through the analysis of the 'why' behind temptation and the nature of evil. The preacher pauses to analyze the social dynamics of the 'household of faith,' specifically how gossip and envy function. However, the sermon moves quite quickly from the 'problem' to the 'solution' (God's faithfulness), which limits the depth of the reflective pause.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Scriptures doubtlessly intend to lump under that word all that puts faithfulness to God under test.",

      "analysis": "This is the strongest phase of the sermon. The preacher provides a clear, logical exposition of the character of God (faithfulness) and the mechanics of the 'way of escape.' The theological framework is robust, moving from the nature of Christ's temptation to the dogmatic assurance of God's sovereignty over the 'hellhounds.'",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is weak in providing concrete, actionable steps. While it calls the hearer to 'say it to yourself' (God is faithful), the application remains largely internal and cognitive. There is a strong ethical rebuke regarding gossip, but it lacks a 'how-to' for the hearer who finds themselves currently in the grip of a specific temptation.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of a Declarative-Visionary approach that prioritizes theological depth and emotional resonance over practical application. It begins effectively with a 'Concrete Experience' through the 'haunted house' metaphor, though this remains somewhat abstract. The 'Reflective Observation' phase provides a good analysis of church-social dynamics (gossip), but the 'Abstract Conceptualization' is where the sermon truly lives, offering a robust defense of God's faithfulness. The 'Active Experimentation' phase is the weakest, relying on internal cognitive shifts rather than concrete behavioral steps. The language is highly rhetorical and repetitive, which aids memory but can occasionally substitute for depth in the 'how-to' of the Christian life.",

      "Pause longer in the 'Reflective' phase to ask 'Why do we find it so hard to believe God is faithful?'"
    ],
    "conclusion": "This is a solid, theologically sound sermon that provides significant comfort and intellectual clarity. It successfully navigates the first three phases of Kolb's cycle but fails to provide a robust 'Active Experimentation' phase. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'Head and Heart' sermon that lacks 'Hands.' The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the grand truth of God's faithfulness and the specific, messy reality of the hearer's daily struggle with temptation."
