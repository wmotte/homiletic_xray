It avoids the common homiletical games of guilt-tripping (NIGYSOB) or offering cheap solutions (ITHY). By acknowledging the 'hard work' of faith and the reality of grief, the preacher validates the listener's Adult reality. The move toward the 'Father' is presented as a safe return to a nurturing origin rather than a submission to a Critical Parent.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to acknowledge the 'in-between' nature of faith; it keeps the communication in the Adult-Adult realm by respecting the complexity of the listener's lived experience."
