    "sermon_start_end": "On the first Sunday of Advent—three days ago—the New York Times book review section featured an article about the latest biography of Martin Luther King Jr. There is nothing particularly new in the review, but the way that the reviewer has put it together is a grabber [...] Never to leave me, never to leave me alone. No never alone. No never alone. He promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone. Amen."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "While the sermon quotes Romans 13, it uses the text more as a thematic framework for the concept of 'Advent' rather than extracting what is unique to this specific passage. The focus shifts quickly to a biography of MLK and general 'Time Between' theology. It fails to identify what this text says that can be found nowhere else.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let’s listen again carefully to the wonderful text from Romans for the first Sunday in Advent.",
        "Notice first of all 'what time it is.' It is still night, though the night is 'far gone.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Isolate the specific linguistic and theological nuances of Romans 13:11-14 (e.g., the 'armor of light' metaphor or the specific list of vices) and explain why Paul uses these specific terms here instead of general Advent themes."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is almost no formal exegesis. The preacher does not engage with the original Greek, the Roman context, or Paul's specific theological argument in the letter to the Romans. The 'exposition' is replaced by a biographical analysis of Martin Luther King Jr.",
      "quotes": [
        "Saint Paul writes:",
        "Martin Luther King contended with two different types of 'works of darkness.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must demonstrate knowledge of the original context. What did 'reveling and drunkenness' mean in a Roman urban context? Why does Paul use the 'waking from sleep' imagery for this specific congregation?"
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part, though it leans heavily on a single biography and a newspaper snippet. It successfully bridges the text to the 'zeitgeist' by discussing modern heroism versus 'nonheroic' life and the visibility of social problems like homelessness.",
      "quotes": [
        "A young woman who volunteered in response to a radio appeal is quoted in today’s Times",
        "Every harsh word, every mean act, every vengeful thought is a part of the works of darkness."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the 'New York Times' examples to more diverse spheres of the humanities—psychology or cultural philosophy—to deepen the 'nonheroic' application."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon avoids the 'block' structure (first exegesis, then application). Instead, it weaves the life of MLK into the reading of the text. However, because the exegesis is thin, the 'interweaving' feels more like using the Bible to illustrate a biography rather than the text expounding the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "Did Martin Luther King 'cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light'? In some ways, yes, in some ways, no"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the text remains the subject that 'expounds' the contemporary situation, rather than the contemporary biography serving as the primary lens through which the text is viewed."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The three parts are present in the background. Misery is identified as the 'inner demons' and 'works of darkness'; redemption is the 'Sun of Righteousness'; gratitude is the 'one tiny link' of service. It avoids over-objectification by focusing on the 'mortal life'.",
      "quotes": [
        "He was a larger-than-life example of simul peccator et iustus",
        "God will not allow the works of darkness to swallow up his children forever."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by moving beyond sexual 'adventuring' to the deeper theological 'lostness' Dekker describes."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher mentions the 'judgment seat of God' and 'destruction,' but quickly softens it with the promise of never being left alone. The tension of the 'two ways' is present but lacks the 'sharpness' Dekker demands regarding the possibility of being lost.",
      "quotes": [
        "As sinners we will be judged and condemned.",
        "Every step we take in this world is a step toward either darkness or light."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'temporal loss' more strictly. If life is a journey with a purpose, what are the concrete consequences of failing to answer God's calling in the 'nonheroic' life?"
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon concludes with the promise of Christ's presence and the 'Sun of Righteousness.' It maintains the doctrine of the two natures implicitly by showing Christ as the one who judges and saves.",
      "quotes": [
        "The one Lord who is central in the sermon is Christ.",
        "He promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly link the 'armor of light' to the person of Christ more robustly, rather than just using the quote from the hymn/MLK's experience."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1150 words, the sermon likely lasts 11-12 minutes. This is significantly below Dekker's 20-minute minimum. The lack of breadth results in a lack of exegetical depth.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section (Thesis 2) to reach the required 'breadth' for 'depth'."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short primarily on its formal requirements: it lacks rigorous exegesis of the original context and is far too short to achieve the necessary depth. It relies heavily on external biographical material (MLK) as the primary driver rather than the specific biblical text. However, it succeeds in being concrete and contemporary, avoiding generalities.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application to the 'nonheroic' life of the congregation.",
      "Effective use of the 'simul iustus et peccator' concept to bridge misery and redemption.",
      "Avoids 'American' sentimentality by acknowledging the reality of judgment."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (approx. 12 minutes) violates the 'depth needs breadth' principle.",
      "Total absence of original language engagement or historical-critical exposition.",
      "The specific 'uniqueness' of Romans 13 is overshadowed by general Advent themes."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an engaging address, but it is not a 'sermon' in the full sense of Dekker’s definition. It functions more as a theological reflection on a biography than an exposition and application of a specific Bible passage. It lacks the academic rigor (Hebrew/Greek) and the temporal breadth required for true proclamation."
