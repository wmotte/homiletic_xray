    "sermon_start_end": "I want to preach what you might call a post-Easter Sunday sermon, and there are several reasons why I want to talk about this. In February of 1856, Charles Haddon Spurgeon on a Sunday morning in the New Park Street Church [...] When I kneel down at the lily-white throne and look at his nail-pierced feet, surrender my commission and thank him that he made me a preacher —a preacher down here —I shall cry once more, Christ lives!",
    "notes": "The sermon is heavily influenced by classical homiletical oratory and relies significantly on historical anecdotes and personal testimony."

  "kolb_phases_analysis": {
    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience primarily through historical and personal anecdotes rather than immediate situational hooks. The preacher uses the 'Plains of Abraham' and 'Fort Ticonderoga' to ground the concept of 'days that change the world' in historical reality. While these are concrete, they are distant. The most effective concrete experience occurs late in the sermon when the preacher references his own surgery, touching the hearer's empathy and sense of mortality. However, it lacks a strong opening 'slice of life' that connects directly to the hearer's current emotional state.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you are ever a tourist, or if you have been a tourist in Quebec... they will point out Fort Ticonderoga.",

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Reflective observation is present but somewhat superficial. The preacher identifies the 'problem'—that the Resurrection is often relegated only to Easter Sunday—but does not deeply explore the 'why' behind the congregation's potential spiritual 'chill.' There is a brief cultural critique regarding 'gaudy capes' and 'prostituted religionists,' but it feels more like a rhetorical flourish than a sustained pause for reflection on the human condition or the hearer's specific context.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher provides a systematic overview of Atonement theories (legal, governmental, moral, revelatory) and anchors the sermon in a clear 'Big Idea': the Resurrection as the central, world-altering event. The exegesis of 1 Corinthians 15 is the logical backbone. However, the theological depth is sometimes sacrificed for oratorical rhythm, and the 'second day' section remains intentionally vague, which, while honest, misses a conceptual opportunity.",

      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This phase is the weakest. The sermon concludes with a high-energy oratorical crescendo about the preacher's own commitment to preaching 'Christ lives,' but offers very few concrete action steps for the hearer. The application remains at the level of 'knowing' or 'declaring' rather than specific ethical or practical changes in the hearer's daily life. It tells the hearer *what* to believe but not specifically *how* to live differently in the office or the kitchen beyond a mental acknowledgment.",

    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of classical oratorical preaching that prioritizes the 'Visionary' and 'Declarative' structures. It falls short in the 'Pragmatic' task and the 'Active Experimentation' phase of Kolb’s cycle. The preacher successfully establishes the theological and historical weight of the Resurrection, using a sophisticated array of atonement theories and historical anecdotes to engage the 'Assimilating' and 'Diverging' learners. However, the 'Converging' learner, who asks 'How does this work in my specific struggle?', is left with generalities. The sermon functions more as a 're-enchantment' of the Resurrection than a practical guide for living it out. The personal testimony regarding surgery provides a necessary 'Concrete Experience' that prevents the sermon from becoming purely academic, but the lack of concrete action steps for the congregation remains a significant deficit. It is a sermon that inspires the heart and informs the mind but does not sufficiently direct the hands.",

      "Use the 'Narrative' structure not just for the biblical story, but for contemporary stories of Resurrection-living."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a rhetorically strong, theologically sound 'Visionary' address that effectively completes the first three phases of Kolb's cycle but fails to land in 'Active Experimentation.' It excels in providing a 'Normative' framework and inspiring 'Diverging' learners through poetic imagination. However, from a learning theory perspective, it remains incomplete because it provides the 'What' and the 'Why' with great power, but leaves the 'How' to the hearer's own devices. To move from a 6 to an 8, the preacher would need to bridge the gap between the 'lily-white throne' and the 'Stemmons Freeway' with specific, ethical, and practical action steps."
