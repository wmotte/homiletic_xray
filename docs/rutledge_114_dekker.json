    "sermon_start_end": "Last November, on “60 Minutes,” I watched Mike Wallace interview the great French film star Jeanne Moreau. I sent for a transcript, because it was an astonishing exchange. When Moreau first appeared on the television screen, she looked so old and so ravaged that I was shocked. [...] For on the hill of Calvary, the Son of God in his last extremity showed how much we were worth to him. Dante only visited Hell; Jesus Christ entered it in all its annihilating power for our sake, and emerged victorious. “Love alone counts, love alone conquers and love alone endures.” Love was raised from the dead on Easter morning. So faith, hope, love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love. AMEN."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon centers on 1 Corinthians 13 and correctly identifies the specific distinction between eros and agape. However, it leans heavily on the 'hymnic' structure rather than finding what is unique to this text that cannot be found elsewhere. It treats the text as a 'description' rather than a 'proclamatory word' that creates a new reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is a specifically Christian exhortation to a new way of life.",
        "This is not unlike the challenge set before us today as we listen to this celebrated passage on love. It isn’t saying what we think it says."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the specific 'scandal' of this text in its original Corinthian context to avoid it becoming a general treatise on the nature of love."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is thin. While the preacher mentions the Greek 'agape' and 'eros', there is no evidence of the 'Hebrew and Greek' scholarship Dekker demands. The specific historical situation of the Corinthian church (factions, spiritual pride) is mentioned only in passing without depth.",
      "quotes": [
        "Paul here is most emphatically not describing the romantic love of two people...",
        "it was especially designed for the Corinthian congregation."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the specific theological tensions of the Corinthian church to explain why Paul uses these specific negatives (not boastful, not arrogant)."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part. The use of the Jeanne Moreau interview and the specific mention of the 'Capital Fund Campaign' and 'people with AIDS' makes the truth concrete. It avoids generalities by naming specific roles (housekeeper, parishioner).",
      "quotes": [
        "If I contribute to the Capital Fund Campaign, and pray for people with AIDS... but have not agape, I am nothing.",
        "I particularly think of our beloved Frances Nance, who worked for us for twenty-five years..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application doesn't just illustrate the text but 'expounds' the hearer's current misery or need for grace."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon alternates between the Moreau anecdote and the text. While not a strict 'block' structure, the exposition often serves the anecdote rather than the anecdote serving the exposition. The 'present of revelation' is occasionally obscured by literary references (Dante, Shakespeare).",
      "quotes": [
        "It was almost as though Jeanne Moreau were saying to Mike Wallace...",
        "A few moments ago, when I was writing that description of love in action, I realized that I could not do it without thinking of particular people."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Allow the text's own logic to drive the movement rather than external cultural comparisons."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is present as human incapacity ('not within the realm of human capability'), and redemption is linked to Christ. However, the 'gratitude' part risks becoming a list of 'good people' (Frances Nance) rather than a response awakened by the Spirit.",
      "quotes": [
        "In and of ourselves we do not have the disposition to act lovingly in a constant way.",
        "Really to hear this passage is to throw oneself on the mercy of God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Sharpen the 'misery' aspect; the sermon at times feels too 'sentimental' about the examples of love, which Dekker warns against."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are largely absent. There is a mention of 'nothingness' and 'sinners', but the ultimate seriousness of being 'lost' (temporal or eternal) is softened by the focus on the beauty of agape. Life is not presented as a 'journey with a purpose' where choices matter unto eternity.",
      "quotes": [
        "If I... have not agape, I am nothing.",
        "I recognize myself when I hear that word 'sinner.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Thematize the 'nothingness' (I am nothing) as a real possibility of being lost, rather than just a rhetorical flourish."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon successfully makes Christ the telos. The substitution of 'Jesus' for 'Love' is a strong dogmatic move that aligns with Dekker's requirement of the two-natures doctrine and Christ as the source of life.",
      "quotes": [
        "the meaning of the text will become clear if we substitute the name “Jesus” for the word “love”",
        "God’s love for us has a face, and it is the face of our Lord Jesus Christ."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect Christ's work more directly to the 'now' of the congregation's life rather than just a historical/theological fact."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "At over 2000 words, the sermon meets the length requirement. It allows for the 'breadth' Miskotte demands, though some of that breadth is occupied by cultural anecdotes rather than biblical depth.",
      "improvement_point": "Shift the balance from cultural commentary (Moreau/Shakespeare) toward deeper biblical-theological exposition."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short on rigorous linguistic and historical exegesis and lacks the sharp edge of the 'two ways' (the possibility of being lost). It relies heavily on cultural illustrations which, while concrete, occasionally overshadow the specific biblical word. However, it succeeds in making Christ the telos and provides concrete, non-sentimental applications that avoid general truths.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christocentric focus, identifying Christ as the substance of agape.",
      "Concrete application that names specific contemporary contexts (AIDS, church campaigns).",
      "Adequate length allowing for thematic development."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient technical exegesis of the Greek/Hebrew context.",
      "Lack of the 'two ways' perspective; the threat of being lost is not taken with Dekker's required seriousness.",
      "Over-reliance on literary and media anecdotes (Moreau, Dante, Shakespeare) at the expense of biblical specificity."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'satisfactory' to 'good' sermon (Score: 5.8). It functions as a sermon by actualizing the Word, but it lacks the theological 'sharpness' and exegetical rigor Dekker demands of a minister."
