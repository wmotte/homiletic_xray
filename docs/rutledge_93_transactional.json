  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust. It avoids the common TA 'Game' of NIGYSOB by refusing to isolate the listener's guilt. Instead, it uses an Adult-Adult framework to deconstruct the 'Innocence' script (Camus) that most people use to avoid reality. By acknowledging the limits of human power, the preacher prevents the formation of a dependency-based Drama Triangle. The impact is one of 'radical leveling,' which promotes authentic community rather than hierarchical shame.",
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of Adult ego state to process difficult emotions.",
      "Avoids the 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' trap by admitting human inadequacy.",
      "Uses 'Critical Parent' language only to mirror and dismantle the listener's own internal CP."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the 'gruesome details' of the trial to the theological 'refining gold' could be jarring for a 'Child' ego state in the audience.",
      "Slightly more 'Free Child' joy could balance the heavy 'Bottom of the Night' theme."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' instead of 'you' when discussing judgment. This maintains the Adult-Adult horizontal transaction and prevents the preacher from slipping into a Persecutor role."
