  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and promotes autonomy. It utilizes the Adult ego state to analyze social structures and the Nurturing Parent to offer grace. By identifying 'score-keeping' as a symptom of the 'old world,' the preacher effectively describes what TA calls 'Games' and offers 'Forgiveness' as the Adult alternative. The sermon avoids the trap of the Drama Triangle by refusing to play the Rescuer; instead, it invites the listeners to recognize a reality (Baptism) they already possess.",

      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement.",

    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Slight risk of 'Ain't It Awful' in the section regarding the 'war on baptism'.",
      "Could engage the Free Child more through sensory or imaginative storytelling."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'we' to maintain Adult-Adult parity. Ensure that the critique of 'White nationalism' remains an Adult analysis of systems to prevent listeners from retreating into a defensive Adapted Child (rebellious) position."
