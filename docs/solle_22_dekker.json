  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Acts 1:8 as a springboard for a political and biographical discourse on Oscar Romero. It fails to identify what is unique to this specific text. Instead of exploring the pneumatological or missiological specificity of the Lukan promise, the preacher treats 'witness' as a general category for political resistance.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ich will zwei Gedanken aus diesem Text entfalten: 1. Die Toten sind nicht tot. 2. Auch wir werden Zeugen sein."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify what Acts 1:8 says that cannot be found elsewhere. Focus on the specific movement from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth as a divine necessity, rather than just a list of modern geographical locations."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of linguistic or historical-critical exegesis. The original context of the disciples in the post-resurrection/pre-ascension window is entirely ignored in favor of contemporary Latin American history. The requirement of knowing Hebrew/Greek and biblical history is not met.",
      "quotes": [
        "Der Text zu unserem Gottesdienst steht in der Apostelgeschichte und lautet..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explain the original situation of the 'verängstigten Jüngern' (scarcely mentioned) and the theological significance of 'witness' (martys) in the Lukan context before jumping to modern martyrs."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the political situation in El Salvador and the life of Oscar Romero. However, the application to the local congregation (Hamburg-Altona) remains somewhat general and rhetorical. It relies heavily on 'zeitgeist' and political philosophy (Liberation Theology).",
      "quotes": [
        "...warum dann nicht auch in Hamburg-Altona, in Brockdorf und in Brunsbüttel?",
        "Er zieht uns in den großen Bekehrungsprozess hinein, der heute von den Armen zu den Reichen... geht."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the application to the specific local congregation more concrete. What does 'witness' look like in Hamburg-Altona beyond merely 'not being afraid'?"
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Exposition and application are not mixed because exposition is largely absent. The text is used as a motto for a pre-conceived narrative about Romero. The 'present of revelation' is replaced by a 'present of political solidarity'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wie Oscar Romero, so auch wir. Wie Jesus, so auch wir."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Allow the text to 'expound' the hearer. Instead of using Romero to explain the text, use the text to explain the human condition of the hearer today."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The category of 'misery' is present as political oppression and 'truth-incapacity'. 'Redemption' is framed as 'conversion' through the poor. However, this is more sociological than dogmatic. The Trinitarian background is weak; the Spirit is reduced to 'courage and truth-capacity'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Was ist die Kraft des Geistes? Nach alter Lehre zweierlei: Mut und Wahrheitsfähigkeit."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the concept of misery beyond political lack. Address the 'misery before God' that necessitates the Holy Spirit's intervention."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on 'being lost in time' (the destruction of society through injustice). However, it lacks the ultimate seriousness of the two ways in an eternal sense. It leans toward a liberal tradition where 'lostness' is purely collective/temporal.",
      "quotes": [
        "...viele andere, die die Realität nicht wahrhaben wollen.",
        "Es gibt keinen Ort in der Welt, der zu finster wäre..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the individual responsibility of the hearer. Address the possibility of being lost not just as a social failure, but as a failure to answer God's calling personally."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "While Christ is mentioned as the speaker, the 'telos' of the sermon feels more like the 'cause of justice' or the 'example of Romero'. Christ is not clearly presented as the one in whom our life is hidden outside ourselves; he is more of a prototype for the martyr.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wie Jesus, so auch wir.",
        "Christus den verängstigten Jüngern sagt: »Ihr werdet meine Zeugen sein.« Wie Oscar Romero, so auch wir."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure Christ is the goal (telos) who detaches man from himself. Move from 'Jesus as example' to 'Christ as the only source of grace'."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The sermon is significantly too short. At approximately 750 words, it lasts about 7-8 minutes. According to Dekker (and Miskotte), this lacks the necessary 'breadth' for 'depth'.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the sermon to at least 20 minutes (approx. 2000 words) to allow for actual exegesis and a more thorough mixing of text and life."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text falls short of the definition of a sermon primarily due to the lack of specific biblical exposition and its insufficient length. It functions more as a biographical-political speech than an actualization of the Word of God. The biblical text serves as a hook for a discourse on Liberation Theology rather than being the source of a unique, current proclamation.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete contemporary references to political figures and situations.",
      "Clear thematic focus on 'witness' and 'truth'.",
      "Avoidance of general religious platitudes in favor of specific historical examples."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Total absence of historical-critical or linguistic exegesis.",
      "Duration is far below the required 20-minute threshold for depth.",
      "The specific 'surplus' of the chosen Bible passage is not identified.",
      "Theological categories (Spirit, Grace, Christ) are largely horizontalized into psychological or political categories."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It lacks the formal requirement of exposition (Thesis 2) and the substantive breadth required for depth (Thesis 8). It is a speech about 'witnesses' rather than a recreation of the Bible into a new, proclamatory word."
