Because the Spirit is restless with our tribal closures. Hear what the Spirit is saying to the apostolic church: “Go further!”"

      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to engage with a specific pericope in its uniqueness. While Acts 15 is mentioned, the text is used as a springboard for a general 'idea' of progress and boundary-crossing. The title mentions Psalm 122, but the text is entirely absent from the sermon body. It treats the Bible as a source of keywords rather than a specific, non-interchangeable word.",
      "quotes": [

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "There is a superficial nod to the Jewish-Gentile conflict and purity codes, but it lacks theological depth. The preacher reduces the complex theological struggle of the early church to 'old habits' and 'certitudes' without exploring the covenantal theology or the specific Hebrew/Greek nuances of the 'clean/unclean' distinction.",
      "quotes": [
        "It was a Jewish church. It had not thought to break with the old purity rules of Judaism...",
        "Peter had learned the purity codes of Leviticus from his mother."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application is contemporary but remains largely in the realm of generalities and political slogans. While it mentions the economy and ecumenism, it does so as a list of 'musts' rather than a concrete application derived from the text's specific logic.",

        "Go further in courage about the economy, because who else will speak?",
        "Go further about othering that violates our passionate exceptionalism..."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses the text as an illustration for a pre-conceived theme ('Go further'). The text and the contemporary situation are not 'mixed' so much as the text is forced to fit a modern marketing slogan (Ford). The hearer is not drawn into the text, but the text is pulled into the hearer's world of ads and social issues.",
      "quotes": [
        "That phrase, voiced as an imperative, might be a good mantra for the apostolic church as well: Go further!"

      "improvement_point": "Let the text's own movement dictate the sermon's structure. Instead of applying a car ad to the Bible, let the Bible's specific logic 'expound' the modern hearer."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The 'misery' is defined as 'tribalism' and 'safe zones' rather than misery before God. Redemption is presented as 'going further' (human action) rather than a purely divine act. The psychological element is present but lacks the Trinitarian grounding Dekker requires.",

      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon lacks the gravity of the 'two ways.' There is no sense of the possibility of being lost, either temporally or eternally. The 'journey' is presented as an exciting imperative rather than a matter of life and death or answering a divine calling that carries the risk of destruction.",
      "quotes": [
        "Go further beyond ecclesial arrangements that are safe and secure from all alarms."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Introduce the seriousness of the choice. What is at stake if the church does *not* follow the Spirit? Use the 'two ways' to show that life is not a 'vacation' but a journey with an ultimate destination."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned toward the end, and grace is identified as important. However, Christ functions more as a justification for the 'going further' project than as the telos (goal) of the sermon. The doctrine of the two natures is not operative.",
      "quotes": [
        "we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.",

      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "At approximately 650 words, this sermon would last roughly 6-7 minutes. According to Dekker (and Miskotte), this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for theological depth. It is a 'speech' or a 'meditation,' not a sermon.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exposition and application significantly to reach at least 20 minutes, allowing the text to breathe and the complexities of the theology to be explored."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily due to its brevity and its thematic approach. It prioritizes a general 'idea' (the Ford mantra) over the specific, unique word of the biblical pericope. The exegesis is thin, and the application, while contemporary, borders on moralistic slogans rather than being an outworking of the specific text. The 'two ways' and the gravity of being lost are entirely absent.",
    "strengths": [
      "Contemporary relevance: Attempts to connect the biblical narrative to modern social and economic anxieties.",
      "Clarity of theme: The 'Go further' motif is consistently applied throughout the short duration."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length: At 6-7 minutes, it cannot provide the 'breadth' required for homiletical depth.",
      "Thematic over Scriptural: The sermon is a speech about an idea ('going further') rather than an exposition of a specific text.",
      "Lack of theological gravity: Fails to address the seriousness of the 'two ways' or the depth of human misery before God."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is a brief thematic address. It lacks the formal requirement of length (Thesis 8) and the substantive requirement of specific biblical exposition (Thesis 1.3). It functions more as a motivational speech using biblical imagery than as the actualization of the Word of God."
