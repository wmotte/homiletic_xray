  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to root itself in a single specific pericope. The preacher explicitly states he could 'take almost any text' and then jumps between Matthew 6 and Matthew 5. This violates Dekker's rule that a sermon is the exposition of ONE specific passage. It treats the Bible as a collection of 'ideas' rather than a unique word.",
      "quotes": [
        "You could take almost any text. I have selected a well-known piece from the Sermon on the Mount...",
        "In another moment in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says: So if you are offering your gift at the altar..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select either the 'anxiety' passage or the 'reconciliation' passage. Do not treat them as interchangeable illustrations for a general theme of 'newness'."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is almost no formal exegesis. The preacher does not engage with the original Greek or the historical-theological context of Israel. Solomon is used as a psychological archetype ('hustler') rather than a historical-biblical figure. The 'exposition' is actually a thematic reflection.",
      "quotes": [
        "Solomon is not just a name, picked at random... Rather he is Israel’s all-time hustler who was persistently on the make."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Investigate the specific meaning of 'righteousness' (dikaiosyne) in the Matthean context and the historical reality of Solomon’s reign beyond modern psychological labels."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Application is the strongest element. The preacher connects the text to specific socio-political issues like gun control, urban culture in St. Louis, and the liberal/conservative church split. It avoids some generalities by naming the 'metropolitan community' and 'suburbanism'.",
      "quotes": [
        "We ask what that means for the people clustered around Jesus in St. Louis this year.",
        "...resentment against auto inspection, gun control and a variety of concerns that we call 'welfare.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application flows from the text's unique specificity rather than using the text as a hook for pre-existing social commentary."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is largely application-heavy. Because the exposition is weak, there is little to 'interweave.' The hearer is drawn into a social analysis rather than being drawn into the movement of the biblical text itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let me suggest some of the things which I think this text might be about for us:"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Allow the text's own logic to dictate the structure of the contemporary analysis, instead of imposing a four-point thematic list."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The 'misery' is identified as anxiety and 'bourgeois Christianness,' which is a psychological/sociological take on misery. Redemption is presented as 'humanness' and 'caring.' This risks being too subjective and human-centered, though it touches on the need for grace at the very end.",
      "quotes": [
        "...humanness means more to God than does our bourgeois Christianness.",
        "Your heavenly father knows that you need them all. That is fundamental..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the concept of misery beyond 'anxiety' to 'sin' before God, and ensure redemption is clearly an act of Christ rather than a human 'decision to care'."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon addresses the 'two ways' primarily as being 'lost in time.' It warns that the church or society will perish if it continues in its defensive, anxious stance. It takes the hearer's choice seriously as a 'decision for the cross.'",
      "quotes": [
        "...the times are coming on the Church when we must ask if we are to be in the world in any way other than all the others are.",
        "It can be the decision that the world of the rat race is not the one we really want to live."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'temporal loss' of the city/church more clearly to the 'eternal' weight of God's judgment or calling to avoid purely secular sociology."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Christ is presented more as a 'leader and model' or a 'mood' than as the divine Lord (theology of two natures). He is the example of one who cared for the city. The telos is 'humanness' rather than the person of Christ as God.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have as our leader and model the one who cared about the city...",
        "The Gospel is not the formulation of an ideology... It is rather a power... It is a mood..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Shift from Christ as a 'model' for human behavior to Christ as the 'One Lord' who achieves the salvation man cannot achieve through 'humanness'."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 14 minutes, the sermon is too short according to Dekker's 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for theological 'depth,' resulting in a talk that feels more like a social-ethical appeal than a robust proclamation of the Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "(Word count analysis: ~1450 words / 100 wpm = 14.5 minutes)"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical foundation and theological dogmatics to reach the 20-minute threshold of 'depth'."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily by treating the biblical text as a springboard for social and psychological reflection rather than as the unique Word of God. It lacks a singular pericope focus, formal exegesis, and sufficient length. While it succeeds in concrete contemporary application, it leans too heavily on 'humanness' and Christ-as-example, neglecting the dogmatic weight of Christ as the divine telos.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application to specific social and local contexts (St. Louis, urban vs. suburban).",
      "Clear identification of the 'zeitgeist' of anxiety and defensive individualism."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of a specific Bible passage; treats multiple texts as interchangeable illustrations.",
      "Insufficient duration (under 20 minutes) prevents theological depth.",
      "Weak Christology; Christ is a 'model' or 'mood' rather than the incarnate Lord.",
      "Absence of original language or historical-theological exposition."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is a 'speech about the gospel' or a 'talk about the mission of the church,' but it fails the formal requirement of being an exposition and application of a specific Bible passage."
