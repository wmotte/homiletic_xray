So our topic is the familiar and the explosion of newness. I. Consider the familiar world in which we live. [...] We know better because we know that the Spirit explodes in our failed world and moves us to live differently toward a common good. We know better and so we vote gladly and loudly. We join the song that is being sung by all creatures of our God and king."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on one specific passage. It treats the Bible as a thematic collection of ideas regarding 'abundance' versus 'parsimony'. By jumping between Matthew, Isaiah, and the Psalms, the preacher treats the texts as illustrations of a general concept rather than letting a specific text speak its unique word.",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is a basic awareness of context (Babylonian exile, the wilderness), but it remains superficial. The preacher uses the context to support a modern socio-economic critique rather than exploring the Hebrew or Greek nuances or the specific theological weight of the biblical books themselves.",

        "The poem we have read from Isaiah was first addressed to displaced Jews who were aliens in the empire of Babylon.",

      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Application is the sermon's strongest point in terms of concreteness. It avoids vague pieties and addresses specific socio-political issues like tax policy, payday loans, and fracking. However, it risks becoming a political lecture where the text is merely a pretext for a pre-conceived social agenda.",

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon attempts to mix the two, but because it moves through three different texts, the movement feels more like a thematic survey than a singular movement where the hearer is 'expounded' by the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "The reason I stress this is because, as you know, there is floating around among us what is popularly called 'the prosperity gospel.'",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The 'misery' is well-defined as socio-economic 'parsimony'. However, 'redemption' is presented more as a shift in perspective or a 'performance of abundance' rather than a radical act of God in Christ. The 'gratitude' is framed as 'voting' or 'doxology', which leans toward human action.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is a world of parsimony and anxiety.",

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon presents a choice between 'parsimony' and 'abundance', but it lacks the gravity of Dekker's 'two ways'. The consequence of the 'wrong way' is social decay ('being lost in time'), but the ultimate seriousness of man's destination before God is missing.",

      "findings": "Christ is mentioned, but primarily as a 'performance' or a 'witness' to a general principle of abundance. He is not clearly the 'telos' or the 'God-man' through whom alone salvation is found. The sermon is more 'Spirit-centric' in a general sense than Christocentric in a dogmatic sense.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Spirit exploded in the life of Jesus. His whole life is a performance of God’s abundance...",
        "In the presence of Jesus, the practice of parsimony is a fraud."

    "summary": "The text functions more as a thematic address on socio-economics than a sermon as defined by Dekker. It fails the formal requirement of focusing on a specific Bible passage, instead utilizing three texts to bolster a general concept of 'abundance'. It lacks the necessary length for depth and leans heavily on a sociological understanding of misery and redemption.",
    "strengths": [

      "Failure to focus on a single pericope, leading to a 'biblical idea' speech rather than a sermon.",
      "Duration is too short to achieve the required depth.",
      "Christology is functional/exemplary rather than ontological/telic.",
      "The 'two ways' are reduced to political/economic choices."

    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker’s definition. It is a thematic speech about 'the gospel' and 'abundance' that uses multiple scriptures as supporting evidence. It lacks the specificity, duration, and dogmatic weight required for right proclamation."
