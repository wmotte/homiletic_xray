They sang \"soldiers of the cross!\""

      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's first requirement. There is no specific Bible passage being 'recreated into a new, current, proclamatory word.' The title and closing refer to 'Jacob's Ladder,' but the text is used as a cultural motif or a keyword for a spiritual, not as a specific pericope to be expounded. It is a speech about the African American experience, not a sermon on a text.",

        "Across the chasm of all these years, I can still almost hear them singing 'We are climbing Jacob's ladder...'"

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 1,
      "findings": "Exegesis is entirely absent. There is no mention of the original context of the Jacob narrative, no engagement with Hebrew, and no theological reflection on the biblical book of Genesis. The 'exposition' is historical and sociological (Civil War, slavery, Civil Rights) rather than biblical.",
      "quotes": [
        "The sermon contains no quotes or references to the original biblical context."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Analyze the original meaning of Jacob’s dream for the first readers/Israel. Why did Jacob need this vision at Bethel? Connect this to the specific theology of the book of Genesis."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part of the text, though it leans toward sociology. It is concrete regarding the 'zeitgeist' and the needs of the community (economic funds, local responsibility). However, Dekker requires application *of the specific Bible passage*, which is missing here because the passage itself was never expounded.",
      "quotes": [
        "Whatever is going to be done in our communities will have to be done at the local level: each church, each minister carving out an area of responsibility",
        "Every black congregation in America ought to develop a fund for community strengthening"

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "Since there is no exposition of a Bible passage, there can be no interwoveness. The hearer is drawn into the history of the African American struggle, but not into the 'present of revelation' where the biblical text and modern life converge.",
      "quotes": [
        "The sermon moves from historical anecdote to social strategy without biblical mediation."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Structure the sermon so that the movement of the biblical text (e.g., Jacob's flight and God's promise) dictates the movement of the application to the community's struggle."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The 'misery' (slavery, pellagra, social loss) is vividly present. 'Redemption' is present but often framed as human resilience or social action. 'Gratitude' is seen in the ancestors' singing. However, it is more 'human-oriented' than 'Trinitarian' in Dekker's sense; the misery is social/historical rather than 'misery before God.'",
      "quotes": [
        "What came out of the slave experience? One of the most gallant leaps of the human spirit: being crushed but refusing to collapse",
        "The glue that held the slaves together was their vision of who they were... in Jesus Christ."

      "improvement_point": "Deepen the definition of misery beyond physical suffering to the theological 'misery before God' that necessitates the specific grace found in the text."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on 'being lost in time' (the failure of the community or the union). It calls for a choice of responsibility. However, it lacks the ultimate seriousness of the 'two ways' regarding man's destination before God. It is more about social survival than eternal life design.",
      "quotes": [
        "For us to have failed as a community to look back upon that civil conflict... is tragic.",
        "Each of our churches must decide what it will do to redeem that particular community"

      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the 'ultimate possibilities' of the human life design. What does it mean to be 'lost' in the context of God's calling, not just social failure?"

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the source of 'stature' and the 'telos' of the spirituals. He is the 'one Lord.' However, Christ serves more as a psychological/sociological anchor for dignity than as the theological 'telos' who is God and the sole source of salvation outside of man.",
      "quotes": [
        "The glue that held the slaves together was their vision of who they were, not in society but in Jesus Christ.",
        "They sang 'soldiers of the cross!'"

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 14.5 minutes (1450 words), the sermon falls short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. According to Thesis 8, it lacks the 'breadth' necessary for 'depth.'",

    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "According to Dekker’s criteria, this text is not a sermon but a historical-sociological speech with religious coloring. It lacks a specific Bible passage, formal exegesis, and the required length. While it is a powerful rhetorical piece on the African American experience and community responsibility, it fails to 'recreate the Bible into a new, current, proclamatory word.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application regarding local church responsibility and economic community building.",
      "Vivid description of human 'misery' in the historical context of slavery.",
      "Effective use of the 'zeitgeist' to call for local rather than national action."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Total absence of a specific biblical pericope as the starting point.",
      "Lack of academic exegesis (Hebrew/Greek/Context).",
      "Insufficient duration to achieve the 'depth' Dekker requires.",
      "Theology is secondary to historical narrative."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an inadequate sermon. It fails the formal definition of 'exposition and application of a specific Bible passage.' It functions as a commemorative speech rather than the Word of God in the form of preaching."
