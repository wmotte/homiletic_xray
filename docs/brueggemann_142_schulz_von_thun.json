    "sermon_start_end": "I have selected as our text the Acts reading for next Sunday in the lectionary, the Third Sunday of Easter. I discovered, however, that one cannot take that moment in the lectionary alone, for the narrative has a much bigger sweep than that. Likely you know of the phrase [...] In the end, it is that man, that Easter man, who matters here. As we entertain the narrative we become candidates to be that man, that person, the moment when Messiah makes all things new. It is a time for dancing and leaping and praising God. Ecce homo!",
    "notes": "The sermon utilizes a socio-political hermeneutic, contrasting the 'Empire' with the 'Messianic' event."

  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates strong exegetical control over the narrative arc of Acts 3 and 4. The 'Sache' is the resurrection, but it is specifically defined through the lens of social transformation and the 'notable sign' of the healed man. The preacher avoids abstract dogmatics by anchoring the theology in the linguistic repetition of 'this man' in the Greek/NRSV text. However, the Barthian 'Living Christ' is somewhat mediated through the 'Empire vs. Kingdom' dialectic. While the exegesis is clear, the 'blue' side occasionally leans into political theory (Gramsci) which may risk overshadowing the primary Christological event with sociological categories.",
      "quotes": [
        "The narrator cannot finish with him, and will not let him go.",
        "A sequence of 'a man, this man, this man, the man.'",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a persona that is intellectually engaged and socially critical. There is a sense of 'enlightened indignation' regarding the status quo. The 'I' is present primarily as a scholar-observer ('What struck me...', 'I discovered...'). There is little involuntary 'leakage' of personal vulnerability; the preacher remains in control of the message. The self-revelation is 'diaconal' in that it serves the prophetic intent of the text, but it lacks the 'fides qua'—the personal testimony of how the preacher themselves is 'lame' or 'refreshed'.",
      "quotes": [
        "I discovered, however, that one cannot take that moment in the lectionary alone.",
        "What struck me about this extended story...",
        "I am no lawyer, but the Holy Spirit is not confined..."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Schizoid mix. The preacher seeks structural correctness and textual logic (Compulsive) while maintaining a certain intellectual distance from the emotional core of the congregation, focusing on 'the Empire' as an externalized object (Schizoid).",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is subservient to the narrative, but the preacher's ego is visible in the sophisticated political critique.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching' and 'Prophetic'. The preacher addresses the congregation as 'you' but often in a rhetorical or challenging manner ('Have you noticed this?'). There is a risk of 'Relationship Noise' where the listener might feel patronized by the assumption that they are colluding with 'military capitalism'. The 'We-definition' is used to group the congregation with the 'fearful authorities' or 'astonished crowd', which creates a distance between the pulpit (the witness) and the pew (the candidates for repentance).",

        "Have you noticed that even the empire of military capitalism in which we live...",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The appeal is strong and directional: 'Repent' and 'Walk'. The preacher correctly identifies the theological 'Zuspruch' (Promise) as the 'times of refreshing'. However, the 'Anspruch' (Demand) is heavily weighted toward political consciousness. The risk of moralism is present; the listener is pressured to 'vote with their lives' against the 'empire'. While the preacher claims the Messiah enters through the 'small door' of consciousness, the sermon leans toward a call for behavioral/attitudinal change rather than resting in the finished work of Christ (Barthian concern).",
      "quotes": [
        "Repent, therefore, and turn to God.",

    "disruptions": "The 'Yellow' side (Relationship) creates noise through its sharp critique of the listeners' lifestyle/society, which may cause the 'Relationship Ear' to close.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a robust, intellectually stimulating sermon that successfully bridges the gap between a 1st-century narrative and 21st-century socio-political realities. The preacher's use of the 'Ecce Homo' motif is a brilliant homiletical move, shifting the focus from an abstract 'idea' of resurrection to the 'bodily evidence' of a transformed life. However, from a Schulz von Thun perspective, the sermon is heavily weighted toward the 'Appeal' (Red) and 'Factual' (Blue) sides. The 'Relational' (Yellow) side is somewhat strained by a diagnostic tone that borders on the paternalistic. Theologically, the sermon risks 'psychologizing' or 'sociologizing' the resurrection into a human 'move toward the future' rather than a purely divine act. While the 'times of refreshing' are mentioned, they are quickly harnessed for the purpose of 'witness as practice'. The preacher’s Riemann type (Compulsive/Schizoid) ensures a high level of structural integrity but lacks the 'Depressive' warmth that might make the call to repentance feel like an invitation rather than an indictment.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a significant risk of 'pinning down' revelation to human political consciousness (Gramsci). The 'Acting Subject' (God) is in danger of becoming a resource for human social 'alternative'.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Original and compelling narrative focus on the 'nameless man'.",
      "Strong structural cohesion and linguistic rhythm.",
      "Fearless application of the Gospel to systemic 'Empire' structures."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Soften the 'Yellow' side to build more solidarity with the 'fearful' congregation.",
      "Increase the 'Green' side's vulnerability—where does the preacher need healing?",
      "Balance the 'Anspruch' of political action with more 'Zuspruch' of God's unilateral grace."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, professional sermon that serves the 'Sache' of the text with intellectual vigor, though it demands much from the hearer's 'Appeal Ear'."
