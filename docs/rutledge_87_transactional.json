  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust. It avoids the common pulpit trap of the Critical Parent/Adapted Child dynamic. Instead, it utilizes the Adult ego state to provide historical context and the Nurturing Parent to provide existential meaning. It empowers the listener by validating their 'marginal' status as a position of strength rather than weakness. While it flirts with 'Ain't It Awful' regarding modern culture, it uses this to build a cohesive identity for the Catholic Worker community rather than to induce paralysis.",
    "strengths": [
      "High Adult engagement with history and text.",
      "Empowerment of the listener's agency ('There is a man/woman!').",
      "Transparency about the preacher's own intellectual journey."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Slight risk of creating an 'Us vs. Them' binary (Hellenized vs. Hasidim).",
      "Potential to idealize martyrdom, which can be a 'Victim' role payoff."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize the 'Adult' responsibility of the listener to interpret their own 'here-and-now' without relying solely on the preacher's 'vision'."
