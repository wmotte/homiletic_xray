    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses John 14 as a base but quickly pivots to a thematic treatment of the Holy Spirit via the Apostles' Creed. It fails Dekker's test of finding what is in THIS text that is nowhere else; instead, it uses the text to explain general Trinitarian and Pneumatological dogmas.",
      "quotes": [
        "we’re doing it using the outline of the Apostles’ Creed",
        "If you’re going to learn about the Holy Spirit, there’s no better place in the Bible to go than right here."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Abandon the systematic 'three headings' approach derived from dogmatics and focus on the specific Johannine logic of the 'Paraclete' as a replacement for the physical presence of Jesus."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "There is adequate attention to the Greek terminology (allos vs. heteros, parakletos), which Dekker requires. However, the 'religious history of Israel' is absent, and the context is treated more as a literary setting for a lecture than a historical moment of crisis for the disciples.",
      "quotes": [
        "In Greek, there are two words that can be translated another",
        "The Greek word is parakletos, someone who 'parakleos' you."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the text to the specific anxiety of the disciples in the Upper Room context rather than treating it as a timeless lecture on the Trinity."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is largely psychological and individualistic. While Dekker allows for psychology, he demands concreteness in the 'zeitgeist'. This sermon remains in the realm of general spiritual feelings and 'self-regard' without addressing specific societal or ecclesiastical realities.",
      "quotes": [
        "It would change your self-regard.",
        "Stop thinking about yourself all the time. Stop your self-assertion."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the 'internal' psychological state of the believer to concrete applications in politics, society, or specific congregational life."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a didactic structure: explanation followed by 'Have you felt this?'. This creates a separation where the text is a source of information and the application is a subsequent emotional check. It lacks the 'one movement' Dekker seeks.",
      "quotes": [
        "So let’s look at what we’re taught about the Holy Spirit in this section, and let’s look at it under three headings",
        "Have you been melted with the joy and the awe at the knowledge of that?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Integrate the 'application' into the 'exposition' so that the hearing of the Word is itself the experience of the Spirit, rather than a reflection on it."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon strongly utilizes the categories of misery (sin, orphanhood, condemnation) and redemption (Christ as Advocate). It effectively uses the 'three parts' as a background framework for the human subject.",
      "quotes": [
        "the Spirit will tell you you’re a sinner",
        "He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins",
        "gratitude awakened by the Spirit... glory and the joy"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by addressing 'temporal loss' or the specific misery of the 'world' mentioned in the text (v. 17)."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on the 'two ways' through the concept of the Spirit's 'argument' and the warning against 'quenching the Spirit'. However, the ultimate seriousness of being 'lost' is softened by a focus on psychological comfort.",
      "quotes": [
        "the outcome is in doubt. Will you be locked up or sent away forever or will you be freed?",
        "Don’t quench the Spirit"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly address the possibility of 'being lost' (temporal or eternal) as a consequence of rejecting the Spirit's testimony."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "The sermon is strongly Christocentric. It correctly identifies Christ as the telos and emphasizes the 'two natures' (Jesus as God/Man Advocate). Grace is central to the 'first Advocate' section.",
      "quotes": [
        "the second Advocate's work is to point to Jesus",
        "He’s pointing to the work of the first Advocate... that’s what raises you to the heavens"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the Spirit's divinity is not just a dogmatic 'dizzying' fact but a functional necessity for the 'present' of revelation."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At approximately 3,400 words, the sermon meets Dekker's requirement for 'breadth' to achieve 'depth'. It allows for extensive illustration and theological development.",
      "quotes": [
        "(Word count analysis: ~34 minutes)"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Maintain the length but reduce the 'lecturing' tone to allow the Scripture's own specific voice more room."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon functions more as a systematic theological lecture on the Trinity and the Holy Spirit than a specific exposition of John 14. It relies heavily on external frameworks (Apostles' Creed, Charles Hodge, Jonathan Edwards) rather than extracting the unique 'nowhere else' quality of the pericope. While it is substantively strong on Christology and the three parts of the Catechism, it leans too heavily into general psychological application.",
    "strengths": [
      "Rigorous Christocentric focus, correctly identifying Christ as the telos of the Spirit's work.",
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' (misery, redemption, gratitude) to address the human subject.",
      "Sufficient length to allow for theological depth and thorough explanation of concepts."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specificity: the sermon treats the text as a springboard for general Pneumatology.",
      "Didactic structure: the separation of 'who, what, how' creates a lecture-like atmosphere that hinders the 'actualization' of the Word.",
      "Vague application: the contemporary relevance is limited to individual interiority and lacks the concrete 'zeitgeist' analysis Dekker demands."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a substantively rich speech that functions as a form of the Word, but it falls short of Dekker's 'formal' definition of a sermon because it prioritizes dogmatic categories over the specific, unique voice of the chosen Bible passage."
