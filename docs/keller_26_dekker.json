[...] Run to the doctrine of the resurrection. Run to it, and you will receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken. Let’s pray."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon identifies Psalm 16 as the core text and attempts to follow its structure. However, it frequently drifts into general biblical themes (Hebrews 11, 12) rather than mining the unique particularity of this specific Psalm. The 'nowhere else' quality is somewhat lost in generalities about 'foundations'.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s actually one of the main themes of the Bible.",
        "We’re told in Hebrews 11 Abraham did not rest his heart in his wealth..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more on the specific Hebrew imagery of the 'portion and cup' and 'boundary lines' to find what is unique to David’s experience in Psalm 16 that is not found in Hebrews or Proverbs."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher shows awareness of the Hebrew text and the historical context of Jewish belief in the afterlife. However, the exegesis is quickly bypassed to serve a systematic theological point about physics or philosophy. The 'bicycle mechanic' (theologian) is present but works too quickly.",
      "quotes": [
        "Literally in the Hebrew it says, 'Beyond you, no good.'",
        "In that stage of redemptive history... the ancient Jews had some idea of afterlife, but they didn’t have a very strong understanding..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Spend more time on the 'religious history and context of Israel' (Thesis 2) regarding what 'libations of blood' meant in David's specific context before jumping to modern 'idols'."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is strong and concrete, engaging with cultural philosophy, the zeitgeist (New York Times, physics, modeling), and psychology. It avoids 'general truths' by naming specific modern anxieties (aging, intellectual obsolescence).",
      "quotes": [
        "I’m 26. I’m a size 3, but I know by the time I’m in my 40s I may be a size 8...",
        "Things that were written in the New York Times on the editorial page 20 years ago are now seen as hateful..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application remains tied to the text's specific 'path of life' rather than becoming a general lecture on the second law of thermodynamics."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Exposition and application are somewhat mixed, but the sermon still follows a fairly rigid 'Two Points' structure. The hearer is drawn in, but the movement from 'what it meant' to 'what it means' is still visible as a seam.",
      "quotes": [
        "What does Psalm 16 tell us on Easter day? Essentially it tells us two things.",
        "This is an extremely practical psalm, and he tells us three important things that we are going to have to do..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the 'lecture' format of numbered points to allow the 'present of revelation' to emerge more organically from the text itself."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon leans heavily on 'misery' (the shakable world) and 'redemption' (the unshakable refuge). It addresses the psychological 'theft' by reclaiming the search for security as a theological issue. Gratitude is present but less emphasized.",
      "quotes": [
        "Everything in this world is passing away. It’s fleeting. It’s precarious.",
        "The only way you’ll become unshakable is to do those things but run after God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Develop the 'gratitude' aspect more explicitly—how does the 'delightful inheritance' of verse 6 manifest as a life of service or thanks?"
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon explicitly addresses the 'two ways' through the lens of 'running after other gods' versus 'running to God.' It takes the hearer seriously as a responsible being whose choices (what they pant after) lead to being 'shattered' or 'secure'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Those who run after other gods will suffer more and more.",
        "You’re going to make that choice... whatever that is will function in your life... as basically divine."

      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'temporal loss' aspect—how exactly does society 'perish' (Thesis 6) when it runs after these specific modern gods?"
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "The sermon is strongly Christocentric, identifying Christ as the 'telos' and the only 'faithful one' who truly fulfills the Psalm. It grounds the hope of the hearer in the objective work of Christ (resurrection) rather than subjective effort.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus Christ is risen... that guarantees that you who believe in him will be resurrected too.",
        "Only Jesus Christ was completely faithful."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly link the 'two natures' (Thesis 7) to the ability of Christ to be the 'portion'—how His divinity makes the refuge eternal."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At approximately 2400 words, the sermon meets the 20-minute threshold. It allows for the 'breadth' Miskotte demands, especially in the lengthy engagement with C.S. Lewis and the nature of pleasure.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "None; the length is adequate for the depth attempted."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon largely aligns with Dekker’s criteria, particularly in its refusal to offer 'general truths' and its insistence on the seriousness of human choice. It falls short primarily in its tendency to use the biblical text as a springboard for systematic or philosophical reflections (physics, C.S. Lewis) rather than staying strictly within the unique 'nowhere else' confines of Psalm 16. The Christocentric telos is clear and effective.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application that engages the zeitgeist (Thesis 3).",
      "Strong Christocentric focus on the resurrection as the ground of security (Thesis 7).",
      "Serious treatment of the 'two ways' through the analysis of modern idolatry (Thesis 6)."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Occasional drift from the specific pericope into general biblical themes (Thesis 1.3).",
      "Exegesis is sometimes subordinated to cultural commentary (Thesis 2).",
      "Structural 'points' create a slight separation between exposition and application (Thesis 4)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It treats the Bible as the Word of God, maintains a necessary length for depth, and confronts the hearer with the reality of God and the possibility of being lost. It is a solid, theological proclamation."
