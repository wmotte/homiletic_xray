    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The 'blue' side is exceptionally strong and dominates the discourse. The preacher provides a dense theological framework, distinguishing between 'uncreated light' and 'second-order light,' and exploring the concept of 'aseity.' The exegesis is not merely historical but dogmatic, linking the Synoptic Transfiguration with Johannine 'doxa' and Pauline theology. The 'Sache' (the living Christ) is presented as the objective reality of God's glory. However, the density of the information risks overwhelming the 'factual ear' of a lay congregation. The preacher operates at a high academic level, moving from Latin etymology to Greek nuances (idou, nephele photeine) with ease. The theological depth is undeniable, yet it borders on a lecture format where the 'living presence' is discussed more as a category than as a direct encounter.",
      "quotes": [
        "This important theological concept about God’s being can help us understand the biblical epiphanies.",
        "It preserves God’s aseity (Latin aseitas, 'being from itself').",
        "The light that belongs to God’s self is uncreated, because it precedes creation."

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals themselves as a 'Compulsive' type in the Riemann/Denecke typology. There is a strong emphasis on correctness, 'conscientious reading,' and 'untrained people' versus those who 'subject themselves' to the Word. The 'I' is largely hidden behind the 'We' of the church or the 'One' of the scholar. Authenticity 'leaks' through as a certain intellectual sternness and a distaste for modern 'tone-deaf' preaching. The preacher’s faith is expressed through reverence for the text's structure rather than personal testimony. While this keeps the 'I' diaconal (serving the text), it creates a distance where the preacher appears more as a guardian of the mystery than a fellow traveler in the light.",
      "quotes": [
        "On rare occasions I have heard readings where the text seems to escape from the page...",
        "All too many untrained people go through their paces as if they were unaware of the glory...",
        "It became common... to preach about the transfiguration in a remarkably tone-deaf way."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching' and 'Paternalistic.' The preacher speaks 'from above,' correcting the congregation's potential misconceptions and criticizing 'mainline churches.' There is significant 'relationship noise' created by the critique of 'untrained people' and 'tone-deaf' preachers, which may make the listener feel judged or inadequate. The 'We-definition' is that of a community that needs to be 'continually reminded' and 'apprised of the effect.' While the intention is to lead the congregation to wonder, the tone is often that of a supervisor evaluating the quality of their attention and the quality of other preachers' work.",

        "Those who listen... will respond to the way it is presented.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon balances 'Zuspruch' (Promise) and 'Anspruch' (Demand) by grounding the latter in the former. The primary appeal is not moralistic but 'perceptual': the hearer is called to *see* and *behold*. However, there is a strong secondary appeal regarding how one should read and preach. Theologically, the preacher successfully identifies that the 'new human being' is a 'gift of God' and not a human achievement. Yet, the 'red' side often feels like a demand for a specific emotional/spiritual state ('wonder and awe'). The risk of moralism is low regarding behavior, but moderate regarding 'correct' spiritual experience.",

        "The transfiguration of human nature... is not achieved by human means. It is the gift of God.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6,
    "summary": "This sermon is a formidable piece of theological teaching that excels in the 'Blue' dimension of factual/dogmatic content. It successfully integrates Barthian and Johannine themes of God’s self-revelation, maintaining the 'aseity' of God while pointing to the 'doxa' in Christ. However, from a communicative perspective, it suffers from a 'Compulsive' green side that prioritizes correctness and liturgical standards over relational warmth. The 'Yellow' side is marked by a paternalistic distance, where the congregation is instructed on how to receive the Word rather than being invited into it. The 'Red' side is theologically sound, grounding transformation in God's gift, but the delivery remains intellectually heavy. It is a 'Satisfactory' to 'Ample Satisfactory' sermon because it honors the 'Sache' (the matter at hand) with great respect, even if it struggles to bridge the psychological gap to the modern listener.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon avoids unhealthy psychologization by keeping God as the Subject; however, it risks 'intellectualization' where the 'living presence' becomes a theological concept rather than a present reality.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Profound dogmatic depth and biblical synthesis.",
      "Clear distinction between Law and Gospel (Gift vs. Achievement).",
      "Unapologetic focus on the 'Glory of God' as the central homiletic task."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce the 'relationship noise' of criticizing other liturgical practices.",
      "Simplify the linguistic register to increase comprehensibility.",
      "Incorporate more 'diaconal' vulnerability to bridge the distance with the hearer."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A theologically heavyweight sermon that serves the 'Sache' well but requires more communicative humility to truly reach the 'Relationship Ear' of the congregation."
