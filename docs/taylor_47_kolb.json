      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a strong focus on the 'feeling' dimension. The preacher immediately creates a 'mountain' of recognizable human suffering.

It touches the heart through cumulative resonance rather than specific storytelling.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher pauses to ask 'why' and explores the human condition from several angles (biological makeup, the nature of love, the consequence of sin). It avoids premature solutions by acknowledging that the Bible often leaves 'why' questions unanswered. However, the cultural/societal analysis is thin, focusing almost exclusively on the internal/individual experience.",
      "quotes": [
        "Perhaps in thinking about our hurts we attach too much importance to what happens to us rather than looking at the results...",

      "analysis": "The theological exposition centers on the metaphor of the vine and the 'agronomy of God.' The 'big idea' is clear: God prunes not to punish, but to produce more fruit. While the exegesis is present, it is more thematic than a deep dive into the Johannine context. The logic is consistent but relies heavily on poetic juxtaposition rather than rigorous dogmatic development.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of visionary and empathetic preaching that connects deeply with the human experience of suffering. It successfully moves the hearer from a sense of isolated pain to a broader theological understanding of 'pruning.' However, it falls short in the final phase of Kolb's cycle. While it provides a new 'way of seeing,' it offers very little in the way of 'active experimentation.' The preacher excels at 'priestly listening' and 'prophetic discernment' but provides less 'servant leadership' in terms of equipping the congregation with practical handles for their daily lives. The language is poetic and evocative, which serves the Diverging and Accommodating styles well, but may leave the Converging learner looking for more concrete utility.",

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a highly effective 'Visionary' piece that succeeds in reframing the congregation's perspective on suffering. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'half-cycle' sermon—it excels at bringing the hearer into the experience and reflecting on it theologically, but it stops short of the 'Active Experimentation' necessary for holistic experiential learning. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'vision' of God's pruning and the 'practice' of the believer's daily response."
