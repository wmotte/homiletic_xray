  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Bait and Switch' homiletics. It uses an Adult-Adult historical and logical framework to lead the listener into an Adapted Child state of helplessness ('I cannot do it'). While the goal is theological (Grace), the psychological path relies on reinforcing a 'Victim' position in the Drama Triangle. The use of the two mothers as examples provides a powerful 'Free Child' / 'Healthy Adult' model of integration, which saves the sermon from being purely coercive.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult ego engagement through historical context.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'locked room' metaphor reinforces a Victim script.",
      "The 'Bait and Switch' regarding the difficulty of the New Covenant can feel like a psychological trap."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation's Adult ego not just to prove their helplessness, but to invite their cooperation. Instead of 'You are a prisoner who can't turn the key,' try 'As we look at our patterns together, how can we choose to open ourselves to this new influence?'"
