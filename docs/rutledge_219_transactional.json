    "summary": "This sermon is an exceptionally healthy example of Adult-to-Adult communication. It avoids the typical homiletical trap of using the Critical Parent to shame the congregation into submission. Instead, it uses historical and biblical data to challenge the listener's 'Parental' scripts about who 'deserves' what. By identifying the preacher, the congregation, and the enemy as all being in the same 'undeserving' boat, it dismantles the psychological basis for the Drama Triangle.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Could incorporate more 'Free Child' imagery of the 'new life' to balance the heavy 'Adult' data on torture.",
      "Slight risk of 'Nurturing Parent' smothering when discussing the 'temple of the spirit,' though largely avoided."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'We' language to maintain the Adult-Adult transaction. Ensure that the 'Switch' in Formula G never occurs by refusing to move from the 'Rescuer' (offering grace) to the 'Persecutor' (judging those who don't accept it)."
