  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exemplary model of psychologically healthy homiletics. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, respecting the listener's intelligence and emotional reality. It avoids the common 'Bait and Switch' game by being transparent about the 'depressing' nature of the Passion. By refusing to offer easy 'Rescuer' answers for chronic suffering (Sarah) or political horror (Guinea), the preacher fosters a mature, non-dependent faith. The use of the Nurturing Parent is supportive rather than smothering, and the Critical Parent is almost entirely absent, replaced by a shared sense of 'liturgical wisdom.'",

      "High transparency regarding the difficulty of the text.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the 'data of suffering' to the 'New World Order' relies on anecdotal evidence which, while moving, could be perceived as a slight 'Gimmick' if not handled carefully."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name the 'contradictions' of the faith openly. By exposing the 'switch' (Palm Sunday to Good Friday) rather than just performing it, you maintain Adult-to-Adult integrity."
