    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon employs a mix of traditional biblical imagery and contemporary analogies. The most striking image is the 'seventh wave' (de zevende golf), drawing on the preacher's background as a hydraulic engineer. This provides a sensory, rhythmic quality to the abstract concept of 'fullness.' However, much of the imagery remains within the 'telling' domain, particularly when discussing the desert journey. The use of the Prodigal Son as an image for the 'face of God' is effective but leans on a well-worn trope. While the 'kneeling God' is a powerful theological image, it is explained conceptually rather than painted vividly for the listener's imagination.",
      "quotes": [
        "dat ritme van drie, vijf en zeven... waarbij die zevende golf elke keer de hoogste is.",
        "God die knielt om te zegenen. God die in deze zegen neerdaalt uit de hemel.",

        "Develop the 'hand of God' at the end into a more tactile description."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "The sermon leans towards 'telling.' It explains what the images mean (theology) rather than letting the images evoke the experience (aesthetics)."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The language is accessible and conversational, which aids clarity, but it lacks the 'stewardship of language' advocated by McEntyre. There is a frequent use of filler words ('eigenlijk', 'denk ik', 'zoals het ware') which softens the impact of the proclamation. The precision of the Hebrew analysis (3-5-7 words) is a strong point of 'care,' showing respect for the text's architecture. However, the transition into 'Canaanite' religious jargon ('vruchtbaarheid', 'voorspoed', 'shaloom') happens without enough fresh linguistic re-clothing, making some sections feel predictable.",
      "quotes": [
        "En we voelen hem allemaal aankomen, natuurlijk. Het is getal drie.",
        "God die zichzelf hier ziet als een God die geen God is die zijn wetten... van een eindje bij zijn volk dropt.",

        "Tighten the sentence structures; some are overly long and 'run-on' in nature."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Moderate. Terms like 'verbond' and 'shaloom' are used traditionally. The preacher attempts to explain them, but they still carry heavy 'churchy' baggage."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a natural oral cadence, likely due to its conversational style. The repetition of the blessing's structure provides a rhythmic 'heartbeat' to the message. The preacher uses the '3-5-7' rhythm of the text to dictate the rhythm of the sermon itself, which is an aesthetically sound choice. However, the 'musicality' is interrupted by bureaucratic phrasing ('het voordeel voor mij dat ik ooit waterbouwer geweest ben'). The ending attempts a crescendo but falls into a repetitive 'En zo...' structure that feels more like a list than a poetic finale.",
      "quotes": [
        "Een tijd van ontdekken, van leren. Een tijd van vallen en opstaan.",
        "De zegen van God... De zegen van Hem... De zegen van Hem...",

        "Refine the 'En zo' transitions to be more fluid and less like bullet points."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Oral language. It is clearly written to be spoken, with a focus on direct communication."
    },
    "average_score_language": 5.67,
    "summary_language": "The language is functional and communicative, successfully bridging the gap between an ancient text and a modern audience. The 'waterbouwer' analogy provides a rare moment of poetic synthesis. However, the 'stewardship of language' is undermined by conversational fillers and a reliance on traditional religious vocabulary. It lacks the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed tradition, opting instead for a more informal, almost 'homely' tone that occasionally borders on the mundane."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a standard 'expository' path: introduction, historical context, three-point analysis of the blessing, and application. While it mentions the 'climax' of the seventh wave, the sermon's own structure doesn't fully embody this tension. There is no significant 'upsetting of equilibrium' (Lowry); the new year is presented as 'unknown' but not truly 'troubling.' The movement is more informative than dramatic. The 'turning point' is the shift from God's law to God's self-dictated blessing, but this happens early and the tension plateaus thereafter.",
      "quotes": [
        "En dan is het goed, denk ik, om eerst even met elkaar na te denken wat de achtergrond... is.",
        "En dan komen we bij die derde, die laatste zegen. De climax.",
        "En zo wensen we elkaar vanmorgen gelukkig nieuwjaar."

        "Logical progression through the three parts of the blessing.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "Start with a more visceral 'problem' or 'tension' regarding the uncertainty of 2026.",
        "Create a more palpable 'aha!' moment when moving from the second to the third blessing.",
        "Avoid the 'and then we see' style of transition; use narrative hooks instead."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "Static three-point structure. It feels more like a teaching session than a 'happening' or 'event'."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest aesthetic suit. The preacher successfully 'reframes' (Cilliers) the act of New Year's greetings through the lens of the Aaronic blessing. The comparison between the desert journey and the start of a new year is organic and helpful for the congregation. The integration of the preacher's personal background (waterbouwer) with the biblical numerology creates a unique 'between-space' where the text and the listener's world meet. It respects the 'then' of Israel while making it a 'now' for the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "Een reis eigenlijk wel te vergelijken ook met onze reis die we het nieuwe jaar ingaan.",
        "God die knielt... die naast je komt staan in de zorgen van het leven... onzekerheid van ziekte, van ouderdom.",
        "Vandaag, deze elfde dag van 2026."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The 'reframing' of New Year's wishes as 'God wishing us a happy new year' is creative.",
        "Strong contextualization of the blessing within the 'struggle for obedience' in Numeri.",
        "The application is specific to the date and the likely anxieties of the congregation."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Address the 'world on the brink of exploding' with more specific 'reframing' rather than just mentioning it.",
        "Connect the 'shaloom' more deeply to specific 2026 societal tensions.",
        "Ensure the 'waterbouwer' analogy leads to a deeper theological insight rather than just a fun fact."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes. It successfully frames the new year not as a human effort but as a space of divine accompaniment."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is quite 'closed' (Stark). It functions as a 'closed system of truths' where every part of the blessing is neatly explained and applied. There is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or for the hearer to struggle with the silence of God. The ending is highly prescriptive ('Hij nodigt ons uit om die hand te pakken'), leaving little space for the hearer's own interpretation or 'resistance.' It resolves the tension of the 'unknown year' very quickly with the 'certainty of blessing,' which may feel 'sealed shut' for those in deep crisis.",
      "quotes": [
        "Het is een drievoudige verkondiging... verwijzend naar de Drie-eenheid.",
        "Gods vrede als het hoogste geluk. Zijn vrede, Zijn shalom. Als ze zeker weten: 'Mij ontbreekt niets.'",
        "En Hij nodigde ons zo vanmorgen uit om die hand te pakken."

      "strengths": [
        "Provides strong pastoral comfort and certainty.",
        "Clear, unambiguous message that is easy to follow.",
        "The invitation at the end is warm and inclusive."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Leave some questions unanswered—how does the blessing work when life feels cursed?",
        "Use more 'polyvalent' language that allows for different experiences of 'peace'.",
        "End with an image or a question rather than a directive to 'take the hand'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Monovalent. The sermon has one clear meaning and one intended emotional response."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 5.33,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is solid and pedagogically clear, making it an effective 'teaching sermon.' It excels in linking the ancient text to the specific context of a New Year's service. However, it lacks dramaturgical 'event-character' (Immink). It feels like a lecture on blessing rather than the blessing itself 'happening' in the moment. The narrative arc is flat, and the closure is too neat, potentially excluding those who cannot easily reconcile the 'blessing' with their painful reality."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 5,
    "analysis": "The sermon teeters on the edge of religious kitsch. The use of the Prodigal Son as a 'happy ending' illustration for the face of God is somewhat clichéd and avoids the 'pain of suffering' that Cilliers warns against. The phrase 'God die ons vanmorgen nieuwjaar wenst' is charming but risks being a 'pre-chewed emotion.' However, the sermon is saved from pure kitsch by its grounding in the 'struggle' of the desert and the specific mention of 'illness, old age, and loneliness.' It offers comfort, but sometimes the comfort feels a bit too 'immediate' and 'predictable.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'happy ending' version of the Prodigal Son without the elder brother's tension.",
      "The repetitive 'Gezegend nieuwjaar' which functions as a religious cliché."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The mention of the 'world on the brink of exploding' acknowledges external reality.",
      "The 'kneeling God' provides a more profound theological depth than typical New Year's sentiment."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To increase depth, the preacher should acknowledge the 'unanswered' prayers for blessing—the moments where the 'face of God' seems hidden—before proclaiming the light."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is opened by the concept of 'God's self-obligation'—that God dicates what *He* will do, not what we must do. This is a strong 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) move. It shifts the focus from human performance to divine action. However, the space is partially closed again by the moralizing invitation at the end ('it is up to us to take the hand'). The mystery of the 'Name' is somewhat explained away by the 3-5-7 numerology, which treats the Holy as a mathematical code rather than an unavailable mystery.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are mostly resolved; the 'unknown' of the year is quickly covered by the 'certainty' of the blessing.",
    "mystery_respected": "Moderate. The sermon tries to explain the 'how' of the blessing (numerology) rather than leaving the 'Who' in mystery.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the content, but the tone remains slightly moralistic in the application ('we must take the hand').",
    "recommendation": "Allow the blessing to be a 'gift' that stands regardless of whether the hearer 'takes the hand' or not."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 5.8,
    "summary": "The sermon is a competent, pastorally sensitive piece of homiletic work that successfully bridges text and context. Aesthetically, it finds its strength in the 'reframing' of a common social ritual (New Year's greetings) into a theological event. The 'waterbouwer' analogy is the creative highlight, providing a unique sensory anchor for the sermon's structure. However, the sermon suffers from a lack of 'poetic density' and dramaturgical tension. It is more informative than performative; it tells the congregation about grace rather than creating a 'space for grace' where the holy can 'happen' (Immink). The language is functional but cluttered with fillers, and the structure is a traditional three-point exposition that provides more closure than an 'open work of art' should. It is a 'safe' sermon that provides comfort but lacks the 'aesthetic sting' or 'strangeness' that forces a radical new perception of reality.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Creative 'reframing' of New Year's wishes as a divine act.",
      "Original 'seventh wave' analogy connecting engineering to theology.",
      "Strong structural alignment with the biblical text's Hebrew architecture."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Eliminate linguistic fillers and 'meta-talk' to improve the poetics of language.",
      "Increase dramaturgical tension by starting with a more profound 'human problem'.",
      "Avoid 'closing' the sermon with moralistic directives; let the blessing stand as an open gift."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Didactic-Pastoral",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Thomas G. Long's 'Preacher as Witness' (form follows text) and Johan Cilliers (reframing), though it lacks Cilliers' emphasis on the 'aesthetic of the sublime'.",
    "audience_analysis": "Traditional churchgoers looking for comfort and clear teaching at the start of a new year.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'Show, Don't Tell' by describing a biblical scene without immediately explaining its meaning.",
      "Read the text aloud during preparation to identify and cut 'paper language' and fillers.",
      "Try an 'open ending' that leaves the congregation with a lingering image or mystery."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Through the lens of homiletic aesthetics, this sermon is 'sufficient' but not 'excellent' (Score: 5.8). It performs its liturgical duty with clarity and warmth. To move toward a higher aesthetic level, the preacher needs to embrace the 'aesthetic turn' more fully: trusting the power of the image over the explanation, and the movement of the 'event' over the logic of the 'points.' It is a solid Reformed-evangelical bridge-building sermon that prioritizes communication over aesthetic depth."
