    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and exceptionally 'game-free.' By operating from an Adult ego state, the preacher respects the listener's autonomy. He deconstructs traditional 'Parental' religious structures (the idea that God only works through the 'tall and handsome' or the 'powerful') and replaces them with a reality-based observation of 'holy intrigue.' The focus on 'runts' and 'nobodies' empowers the listener's Child ego state without demanding adaptation or compliance. It promotes a healthy sense of 'I'm OK, You're OK' by suggesting that even the 'uncredentialed' are significant.",

      "The 'Be careful' refrain, if overemphasized, could trigger an Adapted Child response in sensitive listeners.",
      "Could further explore the 'Free Child's' joy in the 'ruddy and handsome' description of David to balance the heavy 'treason' theme."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' to maintain the Adult-Adult contract. Ensure that 'Lenten discipline' is framed as an Adult choice for growth rather than a Parent-imposed penance."
