  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a solid exegetical foundation by contextualizing the Johannine community as a minority under Roman oppression. Schottroff correctly identifies the 'Sache' not as an abstract miracle, but as a political and existential reality. However, the 'blue' side is heavily filtered through a specific socio-critical lens (liberation theology). While the historical-critical insights regarding Roman execution practices and the role of women are clear, the dogmatic content regarding the nature of the Resurrection is somewhat thin, replaced by 'resurrection processes' in human action. The theological 'Sache' (Christ) risks becoming a cipher for political resistance rather than the Acting Subject of revelation.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preachers exhibit high authenticity, revealing a state of faith characterized by 'holy anger' and deep lament. Sölle and Schottroff do not hide behind a professional mask; they admit to their own resignation, 'müde Besserwisserei,' and complicity in the systems they criticize. This transparency serves to bridge the gap between the pulpit and the pew. The 'I' is used extensively, not for self-aggrandizement, but as a representative 'I' that mirrors the congregation's potential despair. There is a palpable sense of urgency and personal vulnerability regarding the ecological and political future.",

        "Ich bin müde, resigniert und habe leider recht behalten.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as a 'solidarity of the oppressed.' The preachers speak 'at eye level' with those who suffer, but 'from above' toward those they identify as 'the powerful' or 'traditionalists.' There is a clear 'We-definition' that includes the marginalized but creates a sharp 'Us vs. Them' dynamic. The tone is often confrontational toward the 'status quo' of the church and society. This creates 'relationship noise' for any listener who might work in the 'capitalist industry' or 'military,' potentially alienating them before the message of grace can be heard.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily dominated by appeal (Anspruch). While it starts with the 'Zuspruch' of Maria's encounter with Jesus, it rapidly translates this into a series of demands: self-sufficiency, political resistance, ecological lifestyle changes (baking bread, waste management). The 'Gospel' risks being reduced to a 'Law of Resistance.' The pressure on the 'dutiful listener' is immense: to be a 'true' Christian, one must essentially join a specific socio-political movement. The Barthian warning is relevant here: the Resurrection becomes a human task rather than a divine gift that precedes all action.",

        "Wer heute weitererzählt... der partizipiert an Christi Auferstehung.",

    "overall_communication_score": 6,
    "summary": "This sermon is a quintessential example of late 20th-century Liberation Theology in a German context. It excels in authenticity (Green) and historical-political contextualization (Blue). However, it struggles with the balance between Law and Gospel. The psychological weight of the 'Appeal' (Red) is significant, placing the burden of 'making resurrection happen' on the shoulders of the congregation. While it avoids the 'non-committal warmth' of the Depressive type, it veers into a 'Compulsive' need for political correctness and structural change. Theologically, it risks 'psychologizing' and 'politicizing' the Resurrection, turning God's act into a human program. The dialogue format adds a dynamic, relational layer that makes the sermon engaging, yet the exclusionary tone toward 'traditionalists' limits its communicative reach. It is a powerful 'call to arms' but a demanding 'word of grace'.",
    "barthian_warning": "High risk of psychologization and politicization. God is in danger of becoming a 'function' of human liberation rather than the 'Wholly Other' who acts upon us.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Radical authenticity and vulnerability of the preachers.",
      "Sharp, relevant connection between the biblical text and contemporary crises.",
      "Empowerment of women as the primary witnesses of the Resurrection."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Increase the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) to provide a foundation that doesn't depend on human success.",
      "Soften the polemical 'Yellow' signals to allow for a broader pastoral reach.",
      "Clarify the 'Blue' content regarding the ontological reality of the Resurrection beyond human 'processes'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A courageous and provocative sermon that serves as a 'healing disruption' for a complacent church, but falls short of communicative excellence due to its heavy moralistic pressure and polemical relational signals."
