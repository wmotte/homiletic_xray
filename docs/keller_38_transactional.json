While it claims to offer grace (Rescuer), it primarily functions by highlighting the listener's vulnerability and lack of preparation (Persecutor/Parent). The impact is a sense of 'urgent inadequacy'—the listener is told they are loved, but also that they are currently unsafe and ill-equipped for life.",
