  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The factual content is heavily weighted toward socio-political and ecclesiastical critique rather than classical exegetical discovery. The preacher uses the 'Sache' of the Gospel—specifically the 'community of equals' and the 'God of life'—as a foil to criticize the Roman system. While the references to Leonardo Boff, Dom Helder Camara, and Oscar Romero provide historical data points, the theological 'Sache' (the living Christ) is filtered almost exclusively through the lens of institutional failure. From a Barthian perspective, the 'blue' side risks becoming a platform for a specific ideology (Liberation Theology) rather than an unfolding of the Word itself. The logic is consistent but narrow, focusing on the friction between institutional power and 'the spirit'.",

        "Das System der kirchlichen Machtstruktur und hierarchischen Bürokratie ist demokratie-unverträglich.",

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The language is sophisticated but the targets of the critique are clearly identified."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a high degree of personal indignation and existential involvement. This is not a detached lecture; it is a 'confessio'. The 'I' is prominent ('Was mich empört', 'Ich denke jetzt an'). There is a clear 'leakage' of anger and grief over the state of the church. The self-revelation is authentic but borders on the 'Hysterical' type in the Riemann/Denecke sense—not in a clinical way, but in the theatricality of the prophetic stance. The preacher positions themselves as a witness to the 'true' church against the 'false' institution. The diaconal quality is present as the preacher speaks for the 'marginalized', yet the ego is strongly fused with the role of the righteous critic.",
      "quotes": [
        "Was mich am meisten an der gegenwärtigen Leitung der römischen Kirche empört...",
        "Ich brauche hier die subtilen bis infamen Formen der Bespitzelung... nicht aufzuzählen.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship to the congregation is secondary to the relationship with the 'enemy' (Rome). The preacher speaks 'over the heads' of the listeners to an absent hierarchy. The 'We' is defined as the community of the suffering and the critical ('wir', 'unsere Götzen'). However, there is a paternalistic/teaching tone toward the 'people' (the 'Laos'), who are described as victims. The relationship noise is high: the aggressive tone against the Vatican may create a 'fortress mentality' or, conversely, make the listener feel like a bystander to a private war. The 'You' is often directed at the hierarchy ('Warum wollt ihr...'), which is rhetorically powerful but relationally confusing for a local congregation.",

        "Warum wollt ihr denn sterben?",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is dominated by 'Anspruch' (Demand/Law) rather than 'Zuspruch' (Promise/Gospel). The appeal is to wake up, to resist, and to abandon 'male neuroses'. Even the 'Zuspruch' (the vision of Ezekiel) is used as a final rhetorical flourish to demand hope in the face of death. The ratio is approximately 80% Law (critique of sin/system) and 20% Gospel (the Ruach). The risk of moralism is high, specifically 'political moralism'. The listener is left with a sense of duty to be 'mündig' (mature) and to resist, which can lead to exhaustion. The 'Gift' of God is presented as something the institution is actively blocking, making the Gospel dependent on human reform.",

    "dominant_side": "Red (Appeal) / Green (Self-Revelation)",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 5.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a powerful example of 'Prophetic Polemic'. It succeeds in creating a sharp, clear-cut front between 'the God of life' and 'the system of death'. However, from a homiletical perspective, it suffers from an over-reliance on the 'Appeal' and 'Self-revelation' sides. Theologically, it leans heavily on the 'Law' (the critique of the institution) while the 'Gospel' (the acting subject of God) is largely relegated to the final paragraph. The preacher's indignation is authentic, but it risks instrumentalizing the biblical text for a specific ecclesiastical-political agenda. The Ezekiel text is used more as a rhetorical weapon than as a source of comfort. The sermon is 'successful' in mobilizing emotion, but potentially 'failing' in providing the 'fides qua'—the trust in a God who acts even in spite of the church.",
    "barthian_warning": "High risk of psychologization and politicization. God is presented as the 'perspective of the powerless', which risks turning God into a sociological category rather than the 'Wholly Other' who judges both the institution and its critics.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Uncompromising intellectual and emotional honesty.",
      "Vivid imagery and powerful rhetorical questions.",
      "Strong solidarity with the victims of history."

    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Shift the focus from 'what is wrong with Rome' to 'what God is doing'.",
      "Balance the polemic with pastoral care for the listener's own spiritual hunger.",
      "Integrate the biblical text earlier to allow it to speak for itself."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A courageous but one-sided 'Kampfpredigt' (battle sermon) that prioritizes institutional critique over the proclamation of the Promise."
