    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon attempts to connect with the hearer's life world through general examples of modern pressure and workplace stress. However, it lacks a deep, immersive narrative or a specific 'slice of life' that evokes strong emotional identification. The experiences described (CITO tests, targets, social media) are recognizable but remain somewhat generic lists rather than evocative experiences.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher effectively pauses at the human condition, specifically regarding the difficulty of 'terechtwijzen' (admonishing) and the paradox of wealth versus discouragement. There is a clear attempt to analyze 'why' things are the way they are in the current culture, though the analysis remains at a surface level of social observation.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is the strongest phase of the sermon. The preacher provides a clear logical structure based on four relationships. The exegesis of the Greek terms (e.g., 'arbeiden', 'leidinggevende') is solid and serves to clarify the biblical text. The 'big idea'—that our horizontal relationships are fueled by our vertical relationship with God—is clearly formulated.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon offers several applications, but they remain somewhat general. While it calls for 'terechtwijzen', 'bemoedigen', and 'bidden', it lacks specific 'how-to' steps for the hearer to implement these in the coming week. The call to 'jaag het goede na' is presented as a movement, but the concrete manifestation remains vague.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wilt u dat onthouden wanneer u misschien een keer in het visnet leest dat u denkt: 'Nou ja, zeg!'",

    "summary": "This sermon is a solid, well-structured example of declarative preaching. It falls short in the 'Concrete Experience' phase, as it relies on general lists of modern stressors rather than immersive storytelling or specific anecdotes. This makes the 'hook' less effective for hearers who learn through feeling. The 'Abstract Conceptualization' is the sermon's strength; the preacher provides clear theological categories and sound exegesis that help the congregation understand the text's logic. However, the 'Active Experimentation' remains somewhat abstract; while prayer and patience are emphasized, the 'how' of daily implementation is not fully realized. The sermon addresses the 'Assimilating' learner effectively but leaves the 'Accommodating' learner with little to grasp. It is a teaching-oriented sermon that prioritizes intellectual clarity over experiential transformation.",

    "conclusion": "The sermon is a clear and theologically sound exposition of 1 Thessalonians 5. It functions well as a teaching tool (Assimilating style) but lacks the experiential depth (Concrete Experience) and practical specificity (Active Experimentation) required for a full Kolb cycle. The priority for improvement is to move beyond general descriptions of 'modern life' toward specific, evocative narratives that allow the hearer to 'feel' the weight of the text before being given the theological solution."
