[...] The music here of the spiritual celebrates the supreme meeting and dialogue in all of the universe — that between the risen Lord and one who knows that life can be forever different only when the Lord's voice has spoken and the enraptured soul has heard it and replied. 'Mary.' 'Master!'",

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively facilitates concrete experience by anchoring the abstract concept of resurrection in the visceral reality of grief and the physical setting of a cemetery. It avoids generic descriptions of 'sadness' and instead focuses on the 'cold, chill heaviness' of death. The preacher invites the hearer to stand with Mary at the tomb, making the experience recognizable to anyone who has faced loss. However, it relies heavily on historical narrative rather than modern-day 'slices of life,' which may slightly distance the immediate experience for some hearers.",
      "quotes": [
        "When Friday's death was over, all who knew and loved Jesus were dazed and numb with that cold, chill heaviness which death ever brings to our human hearts.",

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon pauses to explore the 'why' of human existence and the problem of mortality. It uses the questions of Job and an ancient philosopher to frame the human condition. It also provides a cultural critique of then-contemporary movements (Black Power, Marxism). While it identifies the 'problem' (the finality of death vs. the persistence of love), it often moves quickly into narrative resolution rather than lingering in the tension of the 'why'.",
      "quotes": [
        "What difference the virtuous and the foolish? In other words, what is there that gives meaning to this crazy quilt we call life where all, the wise and the foolish, die alike?",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Theological depth is present but is often secondary to the narrative flow. The 'big idea' is the personal nature of the resurrection (Jesus calling by name). The exegesis is narrative-driven rather than systematic. While it mentions 'biblical truth' and 'doctrines,' it doesn't build a complex theological framework, preferring to let the story carry the weight of the truth. The logic is more 'logic of the heart' than dogmatic argumentation.",

      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase of the sermon. The application remains largely internal and emotional rather than external and ethical. The call to action is an invitation to 'listen for my name' or to persist in love, but it lacks specific, concrete steps for the hearer to implement on Monday morning. It focuses on 'being' and 'hearing' rather than 'doing'.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of narrative and visionary preaching that excels in creating an emotional and imaginative connection with the Easter story. It successfully anchors the resurrection in the universal human experience of grief and the specific cultural contexts of its time. However, from a Kolb perspective, it is an incomplete cycle. It focuses heavily on the 'Diverging' and 'Accommodating' learning styles, providing a rich sensory and emotional experience, but it lacks the 'Pragmatic' and 'Active Experimentation' components necessary for holistic adult learning. The theological conceptualization is present but often serves the narrative rather than providing a clear logical framework. The sermon's greatest strength is its ability to make the hearer 'feel' the presence of the Risen Lord through poetic language and dramatic storytelling, yet it leaves the hearer without concrete steps for ethical or practical response in their daily life.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong representative of the visionary-narrative tradition, effectively engaging the 'heart' and 'eyes' of the listener. It scores high in Concrete Experience and Reflective Observation, providing a profound sense of the 'why' and 'what it feels like' of the Resurrection. However, it is diagnostically incomplete as an experiential learning cycle due to the near-absence of Active Experimentation. It prioritizes inspiration over application. For a congregation seeking comfort and a renewed vision of Christ's presence, it is highly effective; for a congregation seeking ethical direction or practical guidance, it requires further development in the pragmatic and conceptual quadrants."
