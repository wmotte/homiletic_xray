    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes strong, evocative imagery, particularly in the historical reconstruction of Rome and the technological descriptors of 'Modern Man.' The preacher 'paints' the ruins of the Roman Senate and the Appian Way to create a sensory bridge between the ancient text and the contemporary listener. However, the imagery becomes more abstract in the second half, shifting from concrete Roman walls to theological concepts like 'facelessness.' While the 'sparrow' and 'hairs on the head' provide biblical imagery, they are traditional rather than fresh. The strength lies in the cinematic opening that frames the 'Modern Man' as a titan of industry and space, which Paul Scott Wilson would identify as effective 'showing' of human pride.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is dignified and rhetorically polished, reflecting what McEntyre calls 'stewardship of language.' The preacher avoids heavy academic jargon, though terms like 'reprobate mind' and 'mortal human being' lean toward traditional 'Canaanite' dialect. There is a clear precision in naming the social actors of the day (white cop, black militant), which prevents the sermon from floating into vague generalities. However, the list of sins from Romans 1 is recited rather than nuanced for a modern audience, leading to a slight loss of precision in the middle section where the 'contagion' is described in broad strokes.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in its oral-aural quality. It utilizes classical rhetorical devices such as anaphora ('Why should I...'), parallelism, and a rhythmic cadence that suggests a 'pulsing' delivery. The opening is a series of staccato exclamations that build energy. The use of the hymn 'His Eye is on the Sparrow' introduces a lyrical, melodic shift that provides emotional resonance. The rhythm follows a 'call and response' structure inherent in the African American preaching tradition, moving from the 'low' of human failure to the 'high' of the 'bright side somewhere.' This is 'ear language' at its best, designed for performance rather than silent reading.",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon demonstrates a high micro-aesthetic quality, characterized by a 'sober-rhetorical' beauty. It balances the grandeur of historical imagery with the rhythmic urgency of the civil rights era. The language is precise and carefully curated, avoiding the 'sloppiness' Grözinger warns against. While it occasionally relies on traditional biblical jargon, the musicality of the prose—particularly the use of anaphora and hymnody—transforms the text into a performative event that engages the ear and the imagination simultaneously."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'Lowry Loop' style movement: from the 'equilibrium' of modern pride, to the 'upsetting' of the Roman ruins, to the 'climax' of the Gospel's power. There is a clear movement from 'Trouble' (human pride/Rome's fall) to 'Grace' (the Gospel as power). However, the structure is somewhat predictable. The 'turning point'—the introduction of the Gospel in the face of American decay—is clear but lacks a surprising 'reversal.' It moves logically rather than narratively, feeling more like a persuasive essay than a dramatic journey. The energy remains high, but the 'plot' is a standard 'problem-solution' model.",
      "quotes": [
        "What pride we have in ourselves! [...] We may tolerate religion, but we sense no desperate, life-and-death need.",
        "I submit to you that Paul's words describe America in this day of grace.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest structural element. The preacher 'reframes' (Cilliers) the 20th-century American experience through the lens of 1st-century Rome. By equating the 'Voyager to outer space' with the 'Ancient Roman,' the preacher creates a powerful 'inter-esse' space. The integration is not forced; it feels like a genuine synthesis where the biblical text explains the contemporary 'facelessness.' The 'reframing' of the Gospel as the source of 'human worth' in a racially divided society is a masterful aesthetic and theological move that honors both the text's 'strangeness' and the context's 'urgency.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Old Rome had everything — except God as manifest in Jesus Christ.",
        "The white cop, the black militant, the Puerto Rican restaurant worker is, each one, a child of God.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Aesthetically, the sermon leans toward 'closedness.' It functions as a 'witness' (Long) but also as a 'declarative' system. The answers are provided clearly: the Gospel is the power, and the image of God is the solution to racial strife. While the ending is 'open' in an eschatological sense ('on this earth or elsewhere'), the rhetorical path is monovalent. There is little room for the 'ambivalence' Stark suggests; the preacher is certain of the diagnosis and the cure. It is a 'closed work of art' in that it seeks to persuade and settle the hearer rather than leave them with the 'polyvalence' of the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "This gospel, and this gospel alone, can save people.",
        "We who believe are sure that there is a final 'yes' in God.",

        "The resolution of the 'social crisis' feels somewhat 'neat' and dogmatically sealed."

    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is defined by a powerful 'reframing' of the contemporary world through the Roman ruins. The dramaturgy is effective but traditional, moving from a sharp 'upsetting' of human pride to a hopeful eschatological conclusion. While it lacks the 'openness' of a modern 'opera aperta,' it functions as a strong 'witness' that integrates text and context with surgical precision. The structure is a 'marching' one, designed to move the hearer from the 'no' of sin to the 'yes' of God."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids religious kitsch by grounding its hope in the 'stark remains' of history and the 'slashing language' of Paul. It does not offer a 'cheap' happy ending; it acknowledges the 'white cop' and 'black militant' as real, tense figures. However, the ending ('There is a bright side somewhere') flirts with sentimentality. The 'thrills and fills' language also borders on the 'pre-chewed' emotion Cilliers warns against. Yet, because the 'pain' of the social decay is taken seriously in the first half, the comfort offered feels 'authentic' rather than 'kitsch.' It is 'sober hope' rather than 'cheap grace.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The alliterative 'fills and thrills' feels like a clichéd homiletical flourish.",
      "The 'bright side somewhere' quote, while culturally resonant, can function as a 'happy ending' that resolves tension too quickly."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'stark remains' of Rome as 'impressive and awesome' yet dead.",
      "The naming of the 'Puerto Rican restaurant worker' as a child of God in a context of 'facelessness'."

    "recommendation": "Avoid alliterative 'jingles' and ensure the 'bright side' is explicitly linked to the 'cross on Calvary' to maintain the 'weight' of the grace offered."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is opened through the 'reframing' of human identity (from 'faceless mass' to 'child of God'). Cilliers' 'Space for Grace' is present in the 'between' of the Roman ruins and the American streets. However, the space is somewhat 'closed' by the moralizing tone of the mid-section ('we must close ranks,' 'we desperately need'). The sermon moves quickly from the 'mystery' of God's power to the 'utility' of the Gospel for social cohesion. Grace is presented as a 'power' that 'stands a soul on its feet,' which is more 'operative' than 'mysterious.'",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions of racial and social strife are named but resolved through the 'image of God' concept rather than sustained as a 'lament.'",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'immensities of outer space' are acknowledged, but the 'mystery of God' is largely translated into 'accountability' and 'worth.'",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails as the 'source' of worth, but moralization ('we must see each other') is the primary application.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'shame' of the Gospel (v. 16) to remain a tension—why would one be ashamed? This would open more space for the 'scandal' of grace."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of 'Rhetorical-Prophetic' aesthetics. Its primary beauty lies in its 'sober simplicity' and its ability to 'reframe' the modern world. The preacher uses the 'micro-aesthetics' of rhythm and historical imagery to create a compelling 'macro-aesthetic' arc that moves from the 'ruins' of human pride to the 'marching' hope of the Gospel. While it lacks the 'openness' of contemporary homiletical theories, it possesses a 'performative weight' that makes the 'Holy happen' (Immink) through the reclamation of human dignity. The aesthetic failure, if any, lies in a slight tendency toward 'telling' rather than 'showing' in the application phase and a reliance on traditional 'pulpit-rhetoric' that can feel 'closed' to the modern, skeptical ear.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'Reframing' of modern technological pride through the ruins of Rome.",
      "Strong 'Musicality' and oral rhythm that creates a sense of movement and urgency.",

      "Increase 'Openness' by allowing the 'Modern Man's' questions to breathe before answering them.",
      "Shift from 'Telling' to 'Showing' in the middle section regarding the 'contagion' of sin.",

    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing) and Thomas Long (Preacher as Witness).",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers seeking 'dignity' and 'meaning' in a chaotic social context; those moved by 'grand' historical parallels and rhythmic, authoritative proclamation.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Explore the 'scandal' or 'strangeness' of the Gospel more deeply to avoid 'neat' solutions.",
      "Use more 'sensory' details in the contemporary application to match the 'Roman' imagery.",
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer with the 'solitary accountability' mentioned in the text."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically 'strong' (7/10) performance that succeeds in its primary task: making the 'Word' visible in a 'faceless' world. It avoids the 'visual excess' of kitsch while maintaining the 'rhetorical power' of the Reformed tradition. Its beauty is found in its 'transparency' toward the 'image of God' in the human person. While it could benefit from more 'polyvalence' and 'sensory showing,' it remains a model of how 'form' can serve 'content' to create a space where the 'Holy' is encountered as both an indictment and a hope."
