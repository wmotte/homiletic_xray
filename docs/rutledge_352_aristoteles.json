    "estimated_duration_minutes": 15,
    "speaking_speed_explanation": "Based on 100 words per minute",
    "sermon_start_end": "You probably noticed that there is a very unspiritual detail in the story of the raising of Lazarus. When Jesus came to the grave of his friend, he ordered the bystanders to roll away the stone from the entrance to the tomb. [...] He is the Alpha and the Omega, the root and the offspring of David, the bright morning star, risen with healing in his wings: Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. 'Believest thou this?'",
    "notes": "The sermon uses a high literary style, incorporating Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson, and theological heavyweights like Stringfellow and Barth."

  "aristotelian_modes_analysis": {
    "logos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The rational architecture is built on a dialectical tension between the 'sovereignty of death' and the 'creative word of God.' The preacher systematically dismantles the modern psychological view of death, replacing it with a biblical-theological framework. The argument follows a clear trajectory: the physical reality of decay (stink), the theological necessity of death's finality (Pauline exegesis), and the logical conclusion that only a 'Power greater than Death' can intervene. The use of 1 Corinthians 15 to refute natural immortality provides a solid dogmatic foundation, though the transition from the 'stink' of the tomb to the 'cosmic duel' requires a leap of faith that is more rhetorical than strictly syllogistic.",
      "quotes": [
        "Contrary to popular belief, Scripture does not teach that there is any natural carryover of life past death into the beyond.",
        "There can be no true proclamation of the Resurrection until there has been an acknowledgement of the power and the finality of Death.",
        "When Jesus Christ the Son of God steps forward to the door of Lazarus' tomb and speaks, it is the same voice that was heard at Creation."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong internal consistency regarding the 'total' nature of death.",
        "Effective use of counter-argumentation against 'Corinthian' or 'American' views of immortality.",
        "Traceable movement from the concrete (Lazarus) to the abstract (Cosmic Duel) to the personal (The Hearer)."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection between the 'unspiritual detail' of the smell and the Pauline theology could be more explicitly bridged.",
        "The 'mysterious' nature of why the story isn't in other Gospels is raised but immediately dropped without logical resolution.",
        "The conclusion relies on a string of titles/epithets rather than a final logical synthesis."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The Logos is strong because it refuses to bypass the 'problem' of death, creating a logically necessary vacuum that only the Resurrection can fill."
    },
    "pathos": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This sermon excels in Pathos by utilizing visceral, sensory imagery to evoke the 'obscene mystery' of death. The preacher avoids sentimentalism, instead using 'heart-pathos' through descriptions of cold skin, the smell of decay, and the 'businesslike' handling of corpses. This creates a deep emotional resonance with the hearer’s own experiences of loss. By making death 'smellable' and 'visible,' the preacher ensures the hearer feels the weight of the 'last enemy.' The emotional tone shifts effectively from the clinical horror of the morgue to the cosmic awe of the 'realm of light.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Death has a horrible color... Death has a terrible icy feel, too.",
        "They spread out a rubber sheet on the floor, hoisted the body off the sofa... as if it were nothing more than a sack of garden mulch.",
        "Death is ugly, a rotten deal; it is a cheat, a thief, a grinning mockery like a skull."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Exceptional use of sensory details (smell, touch, sight) to ground the message.",
        "Authentic resonance with the existential dread of mortality.",
        "Effective use of poetry (Dickinson, Shakespeare) to give voice to complex emotions."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition to the 'joy' of the resurrection is very sudden, potentially leaving some hearers stuck in the 'stink' of the first half.",
        "The high literary tone might create an emotional distance for less academic hearers.",
        "The use of 'Mrs. Kennedy' as an example is a dated reference that may not resonate with younger demographics."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The Pathos is the driving force of the sermon, using the 'horror' of death to create a desperate affective need for the Gospel.",
      "emotional_tone": "Solemn, visceral, and ultimately confrontational."
    },
    "ethos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher establishes Ethos not through professional distance, but through the role of a 'witness' who has stood at the bedside of the dying. The admission of being 'shocked' and 'not prepared' for the touch of a corpse humanizes the speaker. There is a clear congruence between the gravity of the subject and the preacher’s serious, unflinching delivery. The authority claimed is not personal but derived from 'submission to Scripture' and the 'traditional Anglican' heritage. However, the tone occasionally borders on the 'elitist' when addressing the congregation as 'not the average Sunday crowd,' which can slightly undermine the humility of the witness.",
      "quotes": [
        "I had never seen a dead body until I was a priest in my mid-thirties... I will never forget the shock.",
        "I was not prepared; it was all I could do to perform my task.",
        "It is a compliment to this Easter evening congregation that we are talking about such things. You are not the average Sunday crowd."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "High degree of vulnerability regarding early ministry failures and fears.",
        "Strong sense of liturgical and historical continuity (Anglican identity).",
        "The preacher speaks as one who has personally wrestled with the 'Great Antagonist'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'compliment' to the congregation can be perceived as slightly patronizing or 'ivory tower'.",
        "More explicit self-application in the second half (the 'Resurrection' side) would balance the personal vulnerability of the first half.",
        "The reliance on many external authorities (Stringfellow, O'Connor, etc.) occasionally masks the preacher's own voice."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Ethos is grounded in the 'authority of the witness' who has seen death and found it wanting.",
      "authenticity": "High. The preacher shares personal physical reactions to death, which validates the subsequent theological claims."

  "rhetorical_balance_analysis": {
    "dominant_mode": "Pathos",
    "suppressed_mode": "Logos",
    "balance_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward Pathos, specifically the 'dark' side of Pathos (dread, shock, decay). This is a deliberate rhetorical strategy to heighten the impact of the Logos-based claim that resurrection is a 'new creation' rather than a natural process. The Ethos supports this by providing a credible narrator for the descent into the tomb. While Logos is present, it serves the Pathos; the theological arguments about 1 Corinthians are there to justify the emotional weight of death's finality.",
    "consequences_of_imbalance": [
      "Hearers may feel emotionally overwhelmed by the vivid descriptions of death before the 'hope' is introduced.",
      "Intellectual hearers might want more exegetical depth on the 'cosmic duel' and less anecdotal description.",
      "The sudden 'victory' at the end may feel rhetorically unearned because the 'defeat' was so much more detailed."
    ],
    "recommendation_for_balance": "Strengthen the Logos of the 'New Life' section. Spend more time explaining *how* the Word undoes death to match the extensive time spent on *how* death destroys life."

  "orthodoxy_orthopathy_orthopraxy": {
    "orthodoxy_logos": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is highly orthodox, specifically in its rejection of Platonism/natural immortality in favor of the biblical doctrine of the resurrection of the body."
    },
    "orthopathy_pathos": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon successfully awakens 'God-fearing awe' and a realistic sorrow, avoiding the 'cheap grace' of a death-denying culture."
    },
    "orthopraxy_ethos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the preacher is a credible witness, the sermon is less focused on 'action' (orthopraxy) and more on 'being' and 'believing' in the face of mortality."
    }
  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_rhetorical_score": 7.3,
    "summary": "This is a rhetorically sophisticated sermon that utilizes a 'via negativa' approach: it establishes the absolute power of death to make the power of Christ appear truly miraculous. It is intellectually rigorous and emotionally demanding. The preacher successfully avoids the common homiletical trap of 'perfuming' the Gospel, opting instead for a gritty, realistic portrayal of mortality. The use of literature and personal anecdote creates a rich tapestry that supports the central theological claim. However, the imbalance between the detailed 'anatomy of death' and the relatively brief 'triumph of life' is the sermon's primary rhetorical weakness. The ending relies on liturgical 'shorthand' (titles of Christ) rather than the narrative development seen in the first two-thirds.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Visceral, non-manipulative use of Pathos to ground the theological problem.",
      "Courageous theological stance against 'natural immortality' (Logos).",
      "Credible, vulnerable persona of the preacher as a witness (Ethos)."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Expand the 'Resurrection' section to provide more logical and narrative weight to the victory.",
      "Reduce the 'elitist' tone when addressing the congregation's readiness for 'stronger challenges'.",
      "Bridge the gap between the clinical description of death and the cosmic theology more smoothly."
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Witnessing-Visionary",
    "audience_analysis": "Most effective for educated, perhaps older, or grieving hearers who are dissatisfied with superficial 'comfort' and seek a deeper, more honest engagement with mortality.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Apply the same 'visceral' descriptive power to the 'New Creation' as was applied to the 'Old Decay'.",
      "Integrate the biblical exegesis more directly into the personal anecdotes.",
      "Focus on a single literary allusion to allow for deeper exploration rather than multiple brief quotes."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a strong example of 'The New Homiletic' meeting classical rhetoric. It successfully uses the Aristotelian Triangle to force the hearer into a corner where only the 'Loud Voice' of Christ offers an exit. While the Pathos is dominant, it is a 'disciplined Pathos' that serves the Logos of the Resurrection. It is a sober, effective, and credible piece of Christian proclamation."
