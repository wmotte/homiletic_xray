    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery effectively by grounding abstract theological concepts in concrete, historical, and biblical narratives. The use of the Adolf Eichmann trial provides a visceral, televised 'image' of human depravity that serves as a modern lens for the Genesis text. Keller employs sensory details such as the 'stench' of the human condition (implied through the Eichmann story) and the 'cool of the day' in the garden. However, the imagery is often more illustrative than purely poetic; it serves the argument rather than standing as an aesthetic end. The central metaphor of the 'tree'—moving from the Garden to the Cross—is the strongest imagistic thread, creating a visual bridge between the Fall and Redemption. While effective, the language occasionally leans toward the conceptual rather than the purely sensory, typical of the 'New York' intellectual style.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Keller exhibits high stewardship of language, consistent with McEntyre’s criteria. He avoids 'Canaanite' jargon by defining terms like 'original sin' and 'incurvatus in se' through contemporary equivalents. His precision is evident in how he distinguishes between 'self-interested compliance' and true obedience. The language is economical; every anecdote serves a specific diagnostic purpose. He carefully nuances the human experience, refusing to categorize people into 'good and bad,' instead using precise language to describe the 'mixture' of the image of God and brokenness. The use of the 'if' and 'as long as' linguistic markers to diagnose the heart shows a high level of analytical precision that translates well to an oral setting.",
      "quotes": [
        "That’s not obeying me. That’s self-interested compliance.",
        "Our nature is so deeply curved in on itself that it wickedly, curvedly, and viciously seeks to use all things.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The rhythm is that of a teacher or a trial lawyer—logical, staccato, and cumulative. There is a clear cadence in his 'I see people...' litany, which creates a rhetorical swell. However, the musicality is secondary to the clarity of the argument. The sentence structure is often functional rather than poetic. The inclusion of George Herbert’s poetry provides a necessary 'legato' moment that breaks the analytical 'staccato' of the rest of the sermon. The rhythm is effective for engagement but lacks the 'sober beauty' of more liturgical or high-poetic preaching. It is 'oral language' but leans toward the 'lecture' end of the spectrum rather than the 'song'.",
      "quotes": [
        "I see people demonizing others... I see people out there exhausting themselves...",
        "The first Adam was told, 'Obey me about the tree and you will live'... The second Adam was told, 'Obey me about the tree... and I will crush you.'",
        "Man stole the fruit, now I must climb the tree."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Distinctly oral language; the transcript captures a conversational yet structured 'talk' rather than a read essay."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by 'sober beauty' and intellectual precision. Keller functions as a 'steward of the word' by stripping away religious clichés and replacing them with sharp, contemporary diagnostics. While not traditionally 'poetic' in a flowery sense, the aesthetic power lies in the clarity of the 'reframing'—taking the ancient text and placing it within the modern psyche. The imagery is strategic, and the musicality is driven by logical progression and rhetorical parallelism. It is a high-functioning example of 'plain style' aesthetics where form serves the clarity of the gospel message."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a masterful 'Lowry Loop' or 'Homiletical Plot'. It begins by upsetting the equilibrium with the Eichmann story, creating a profound 'itch' regarding the nature of evil. The movement is not a static list but a journey deeper into the human heart. The 'turning point' is clearly identified in verse 9: 'Where are you?' This transition from the 'trouble' of sin to the 'grace' of God's seeking is handled with dramatic tension. The conclusion provides a resolution that connects the beginning (the tree in the garden) to the end (the tree of the cross), completing the narrative circle. The energy remains high because the preacher consistently raises the stakes of the 'conflict'—the lie in the heart.",
      "quotes": [
        "He was facing himself. The Bible says that’s exactly right, and here’s my question to you. Have you faced yourself?",
        "Seconds into the fall of the human race and he’s already our Wonderful Counselor.",
        "Jesus reverses the work of the Serpent... through a tree."

        "Strong 'upsetting of equilibrium' at the start using the Eichmann anecdote.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 9,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. Keller excels at 'reframing' (Cilliers). He takes the 'strange' text of Genesis 3 and makes it the only plausible explanation for the 'context' of modern New York life (résumés, anxiety, social justice). The synthesis is organic; he doesn't just 'apply' the text, he shows how the text 'sees' the hearer. The integration of Erik Erikson and G.K. Chesterton alongside the Serpent's dialogue creates a polyphonic conversation between Scripture and Culture. The 'strangeness' of the talking serpent is respected but immediately translated into the 'whisper of distrust' that modern people feel toward God.",
      "quotes": [
        "For New Yorkers, that would have been enough. 'Don’t eat the tree because it’s fattening.'",
        "You want to have a great résumé... Those are fig leaves.",
        "If you grasp the biblical doctrine of sin, you will be forced to answer all of those questions."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of ancient 'fig leaves' as modern 'identity markers'.",
        "Seamless movement between psychological theory (Erikson) and biblical narrative.",
        "Honors the 'then' of the text while making the 'now' feel urgent."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could include a more specific 'New York' systemic example of sin to balance the individualistic focus.",
        "The connection to Erik Erikson could be more deeply critiqued by the text rather than just supported by it.",
        "Ensure the 'reframing' doesn't become too predictable in its 'identity' focus."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strongly present; the sermon offers a radical new frame for understanding human anxiety and ambition."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is dogmatically firm, it remains an 'open work of art' (Stark) by inviting the hearer into a process of self-examination. Keller uses questions ('Have you faced yourself?') rather than just declarations. He acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' by admitting to not fully understanding psychology or the 'deeps of time'. However, the 'solution' is presented with such logical force that it might feel 'closed' to some. The 'openness' comes from the invitation to 'behold' the cross, which is an aesthetic act of looking rather than a moralistic 'to-do' list. It respects the hearer as a 'mature conversation partner' by engaging their intellect and their doubts.",
      "quotes": [
        "I don’t understand psychology like I probably should...",
        "Don’t you want this? Get Jesus Christ’s healing.",
        "He asks questions so they’ll come to see it... experience metanoia."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Avoids moralistic 'closedness' by emphasizing grace over 'doing'.",
        "Uses the 'counselor' metaphor for God, which implies a process rather than a flat command.",
        "Leaves the hearer with the 'mystery' of the cross as the final image."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The ending is a bit 'neat'—could leave a few more lingering questions about the 'not yet' of sin's presence.",
        "The 'four points' structure can occasionally feel like a 'closed system'.",
        "Allow more room for the 'silence' of God in the midst of human suffering."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly open; it invites 'tasting' and 'seeing' rather than just 'submitting' to a list of truths."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 8.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are characterized by a compelling narrative arc and masterful integration of context. Keller avoids the 'static three-point' trap by creating a dynamic movement from the 'atrocity' of history to the 'counseling' of God. The structure is 'reframing' at its best, taking the hearer's reality and placing it within the biblical drama. While the structure is tight and logical, it maintains enough openness through the use of questions and the 'Wonderful Counselor' motif to avoid becoming a closed, manipulative system."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'cheap comfort' by starting with the horrific reality of the Holocaust and the 'Eichmann in all of us.' There is no 'happy ending' that bypasses the 'crushing' of Christ. Keller explicitly warns against the 'sentiment' of simply saying 'God loves me' and instead points to the 'tree of death.' By taking the 'pain of suffering' and the 'radicality of sin' seriously, he creates authentic aesthetic depth. The emotions evoked are not 'pre-chewed' but are the result of a rigorous confrontation with the self and the cross. The sermon is 'sober' rather than 'sentimental.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None identified; the preacher actively deconstructs kitsch-like 'religious' motivations.",
      "Avoids the 'Jesus is a nice friend' trope by using 'Wonderful Counselor' in a context of judgment and hiding."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The moment of Dinur's collapse upon seeing the 'ordinariness' of Eichmann.",
      "The description of the 'crushing' of the second Adam in Gethsemane."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Continue to use 'hard' historical realities to anchor theological truths, as this is the best defense against kitsch."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by the radical deconstruction of 'moralism.' By showing that 'being good' can be a way of 'being your own savior,' Keller clears the ground for a grace that is truly 'unavailable' and 'unmerited.' The 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) is found in the 'inter-esse' between our hiding and God's seeking. The sermon sustains the tension of being 'broken yet in the image of God.' It does not resolve the problem of sin through human effort but through the 'event' of the cross. The mystery of the 'substitution' is respected, even as it is explained.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes; the tension between human depravity and divine love is held until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "Mostly; though Keller is analytical, the 'tree of life' metaphor preserves a sense of wonder.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; moralism is explicitly identified as a form of sin.",
    "recommendation": "To create even more space, allow for a moment of liturgical silence after the 'Where are you?' question to let the 'Holy happen'."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'Reframing Homiletics.' Its primary beauty lies not in baroque language but in the 'sober beauty' of its logic and the precision of its 'stewardship of language.' Keller successfully moves the hearer from a state of 'perception' (seeing sin as mere bad behavior) to a new 'optics' (seeing sin as a lack of trust in God's love). The dramaturgy is excellent, using a modern 'upsetting of equilibrium' to make an ancient text feel like a contemporary mirror. The integration of text and context is nearly seamless, fulfilling Cilliers' criteria for 'reframing' and Stark's criteria for an 'open work' that invites the hearer into self-discovery. While the musicality is more 'academic' than 'poetic,' the use of George Herbert’s poetry provides a crucial aesthetic lift. The sermon is a powerful 'event' that sustains the tension between the 'already' of our brokenness and the 'not yet' of our restoration, ultimately opening a wide 'space for grace' by dismantling the kitsch of self-righteousness.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of biblical concepts (fig leaves, trees) into modern psychological and social realities.",
      "High 'anti-kitsch' depth by confronting the reality of evil through the Eichmann narrative.",
      "Clear, dynamic narrative arc that moves from 'trouble' to 'grace' without cheap resolutions."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase the 'musicality' and poetic cadence of the prose to balance the heavy analytical tone.",
      "Incorporate more sensory 'showing' within the biblical exegesis to heighten the 'cinematic' quality.",
      "Allow for more 'open' endings in sub-sections to let the hearer sit with the diagnostic weight before the solution."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Analytical-Reframing (Sober-Reformed with a modern 'New Homiletic' structure)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Four Pages/Imagery).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'urban intellectuals,' 'skeptics,' and 'modern professionals' who value logic, psychological depth, and cultural relevance.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'contemplative' pace in the 'grace' section to contrast with the 'staccato' diagnostic section.",
      "Use a visual metaphor that is less 'legal/courtroom' and more 'organic/elemental' to vary the aesthetic palette.",
      "Read the text aloud during preparation to identify 'paper language' and convert it to more 'rhythmic' oral prose."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically superior work that demonstrates how 'form is content.' By using a diagnostic, 'counseling' structure, Keller mirrors the 'Wonderful Counselor' he proclaims. It avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch and moralism, instead creating a sophisticated space where the 'Holy happens' through the intersection of ancient story and modern struggle. It is a model of how the 'Aesthetic Turn' can be applied within a Reformed, urban context without sacrificing theological 'sharpness'."
