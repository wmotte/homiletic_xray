    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically 'warm' but promotes regression. By emphasizing human helplessness ('we are really helpless creatures'), it invites the listener into a permanent Adapted Child state. While it provides genuine comfort (Nurturing Parent), it lacks a strong Adult call to agency, except for the brief, powerful metaphor of the eaglets being forced to fly. The primary impact is the relief of anxiety through the surrender of autonomy.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of Nurturing Parent to alleviate existential anxiety.",
      "Adult grounding through historical and geographical context.",
      "The Eagle metaphor acknowledges the necessity of growth and independence."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-emphasis on 'helplessness' can lead to religious passivity.",
      "Brief shift to Persecutor ('God will destroy') creates a 'Bait & Switch' from the earlier message of grace."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Balance the Nurturing Parent with more Adult-to-Adult transactions. Instead of focusing solely on 'helplessness,' invite the listener to explore how they can exercise their 'gift of flight' (agency) within the safety of God's presence."
