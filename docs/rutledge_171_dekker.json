  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on one specific passage. It is a compilation of three separate liturgical entries (Easter, 2nd Sunday, 3rd Sunday). Even within the Job section, it treats the text as a thematic illustration of 'revelation' rather than uncovering what is unique to Job 38-42. It relies on general biblical motifs of light and darkness.",
      "quotes": [
        "Today’s text comes from the very end of the book of Job.",
        "Last week we read in the Gospel of John that the disciple Thomas..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one pericope and isolate the 'point that can be found nowhere else.' Stop jumping between John and Job to harmonize them; let Job's specific whirlwind-speech stand in its own terrifying particularity."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is a basic awareness of the narrative arc of Job and the 'customs of the Jews' in John. However, the exegesis remains at a surface level. The preacher mentions a 'modern translator' but does not engage with the Hebrew or the specific theological crisis of theodicy in its Ancient Near Eastern context.",
      "quotes": [
        "One respected modern translator puts it this way: 'I will be quiet, comforted that I am dust.'",
        "as is the burial custom of the Jews"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the linguistic and historical analysis. Why does Job 'despise himself' (or 'retract') in the original tongue? The exegesis must be the foundation, not a summary of the plot."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is strongest when discussing the 'cold clasp of death' and the Alabama tornado. It moves beyond generalities into specific human suffering. However, it often retreats into 'religious' application (the struggle to believe) rather than concrete societal or ethical application.",
      "quotes": [
        "the death of a friendship, the death of a career, the loss of youth, the loss of health",
        "In 1994, a church in Piedmont, Alabama, was destroyed by a tornado..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the 'struggle to believe' as the primary application. Apply the text to the concrete zeitgeist—how does the 'God of the whirlwind' speak to a technological society that demands total control?"
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a pattern of 'textual summary followed by reflection.' While not strictly a 'block' structure, the movement is often: 'The text says X, which is like our experience Y.' This keeps the hearer alongside the text rather than being 'expounded' by it.",
      "quotes": [
        "Job’s great longing is for revelation... That is why he is different from his friends...",
        "Have you buried someone? If you haven’t, you will."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The application should emerge from within the exposition. The hearer should feel the whirlwind's questions directed at them *while* the text is being explained."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon handles 'misery' with adequate weight, particularly in the Job section. It correctly identifies that man has no life in himself. Redemption is placed outside the human subject, in the 'Who' of God. Gratitude is less explicit but implied in the 'comfort' of being dust.",
      "quotes": [
        "I will be quiet, comforted that I am dust.",
        "The realm of darkness appears to be victorious. There is nothing left of the Messiah but the grave."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'gratitude' part is not just a psychological relief but a Spirit-awakened response to the specific Word heard."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon flirts with the 'two ways' by mentioning the choice between a 'domesticated pet' god and the 'God who is really God.' However, the seriousness of being 'lost' (temporal or eternal) is softened. It suggests we 'can' choose, but the consequences of the broad way are not sharply articulated.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have a real choice. We can choose a god who suits us... This god will have no nail prints in his hands."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must articulate the 'destruction' that follows from choosing the 'man-made god.' Take the hearer's responsibility more seriously."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The preacher maintains the two-natures doctrine implicitly by identifying Jesus as 'My Lord and my God.' Grace is presented as the only ground for life. However, Christ is sometimes 'imported' into the Job text rather than being found as its telos.",
      "quotes": [
        "The living Son of God had appeared to him personally.",
        "Any other goal than God is theologically nonsensical."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Let the Christological telos of the Job passage emerge from the text's own lack/longing rather than simply switching to the Gospel of John."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 18 minutes, the sermon falls short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. Because it covers three distinct liturgical occasions, the 'breadth' is fragmented rather than deep. It lacks the sustained 'boring' depth required for true exposition.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Focus on one passage for 20-25 minutes. Depth requires staying with the difficulty of one text until it yields its specific secret."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text provided is not a single sermon but a collection of three liturgical reflections. Consequently, it fails Dekker's primary formal requirement: the exposition of *one* specific Bible passage. The analysis focuses on the Job section, which, while psychologically astute regarding misery, tends toward general truths about 'revelation' rather than the specific scandal of Job 38. The duration is insufficient for the 'breadth' Dekker demands.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong articulation of human misery and the 'cold clasp of death'.",
      "Clear Christological focus (Christ as God and telos).",
      "Effective use of concrete contemporary examples (Alabama tornado) to ground the theological claims."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of focus on a single pericope; it is a thematic 'speech' rather than a sermon.",
      "Insufficient length (under 20 minutes) to achieve necessary homiletical depth.",
      "The 'two ways' (the possibility of being lost) are not sufficiently sharpened."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "According to Dekker’s criteria, this is not yet a sermon. It is a series of theological reflections. To become a sermon, the preacher must abandon the thematic survey and commit to the 'recreation' of one specific text into a current, proclamatory word for at least 20 minutes."
