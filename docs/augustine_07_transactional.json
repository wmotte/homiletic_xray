    "summary": "While theologically sophisticated in its treatment of the 'Supreme Good,' the sermon is psychologically coercive. It relies heavily on the Critical Parent ego state to induce shame and regression in the listener. By using domestic slavery and infantilization as primary metaphors for the divine-human relationship, it reinforces dependency rather than spiritual maturity or Adult autonomy.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as Adult-to-Adult. Instead of trapping them with their own words (NIGYSOB), invite them to observe their own motivations without the threat of the 'rod'. Reduce the use of shaming imperatives."
