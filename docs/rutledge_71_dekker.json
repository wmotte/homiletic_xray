  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Isaiah 29 as a framework but frequently drifts into generalities about 'the Bible' or 'the Word' as a concept. It fails to isolate what is unique to this specific pericope compared to other prophetic literature.",
      "quotes": [
        "The claim that the Bible makes for itself is that it is both powerful and trustworthy.",
        "Listen to just one among a thousand passages about this..."

      "improvement_point": "Identify the specific 'point' of Isaiah 29 that can be found nowhere else. Avoid treating the text as a springboard for a general defense of biblical authority."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is thin. While the preacher mentions the 'prophet Isaiah' and 'the leadership,' there is no engagement with the 8th-century BCE context, the Assyrian crisis, or the specific political 'stupor' of Jerusalem. The use of Hebrew is relegated to a footnote.",
      "quotes": [
        "Isaiah says that the Word of God has been withheld from the educated and the uneducated alike.",
        "The fault is largely in the leadership, but the whole people have gone astray."

      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the historical-critical context of Israel/Judah to ground the 'stupor' in concrete political reality rather than abstract spiritual malaise."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application to the media landscape (CNN/Fox) and the 'zeitgeist' of intellectual disdain for the Bible is concrete. However, the personal family history, while interesting, risks becoming a 'speech about ancestors' rather than a direct application of the text to the congregation.",
      "quotes": [
        "I’ve been reflecting on the way that CNN calls itself “the most trusted name in news”...",
        "I found a letter written in 1893 by my mother’s grandfather..."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a pattern of 'anecdote-text-anecdote.' While not a strict 15/5 split, the text often serves to validate the preacher's narrative about her family or the media rather than the hearer being 'expounded' by the text itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "I am placing my mother’s grandfather side by side in my mind with my father’s father...",
        "Does this make any sense? Look at that word therefore."

      "improvement_point": "Allow the text's own logic to drive the movement of the sermon so that the application emerges from the exposition, not alongside it."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon strongly addresses 'misery' (the stupor, the sealed book) and 'redemption' (the marvelous thing God will do). It correctly identifies God as the subject of the verbs. Gratitude is present in the concluding doxology.",
      "quotes": [
        "God is the agent. God is the subject of the verbs. “God made, God is, God chose.”",
        "The people’s hearts are far from God because his Word is sealed."

      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'misery' is not just intellectual (unbelief) but also existential and ethical, as the text suggests regarding justice."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on the 'mystery of unbelief' but softens the 'two ways.' The preacher explicitly admits to not knowing if the 'cut off' are destroyed or merely thwarted, avoiding the sharp edge of Dekker's 'eternal loss.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Does the Scripture mean that he will cease to be scornful, or that he will cease to exist? ... We do not know.",
        "The mystery of unbelief! Already in the first years of the Christian community it was puzzling."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Take the 'two ways' more seriously as a matter of life and death (temporal or eternal) rather than an interesting genealogical mystery."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, particularly in the final section regarding the 'Incarnate Word.' However, the connection between the Isaiah text and the person of Christ feels somewhat superimposed at the end rather than being the inherent goal of the passage's logic.",
      "quotes": [
        "The incarnate Word of God is a mighty sword put into your hand.",
        "This, truly, is the most powerful name in news."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "At over 2,000 words, the sermon meets Dekker's requirement for breadth to achieve depth. It allows for a slow unfolding of the theme.",
      "improvement_point": "Use the available length to deepen the exegesis of the Hebrew text rather than expanding on personal family history."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily in its exegetical depth and its handling of the 'two ways.' It functions more as a thematic reflection on the 'Power of the Word' using Isaiah 29 as an illustration rather than an exposition of the specific, unique content of the passage. The preacher relies heavily on personal narrative and media critique, which, while concrete, occasionally displaces the biblical text as the primary subject. However, it successfully identifies God as the primary actor (Trinitarian focus) and maintains a sober, non-sentimental tone.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong emphasis on God as the subject of the action (Thesis 5/7).",
      "Adequate length allowing for thematic development (Thesis 8).",
      "Concrete contemporary engagement with the media and zeitgeist (Thesis 3)."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient historical-critical exegesis of the original context (Thesis 2).",
      "Avoidance of the 'two ways' by spiritualizing or questioning the judgment in the text (Thesis 6).",
      "The specific 'uniqueness' of Isaiah 29 is lost in generalities about biblical authority (Thesis 1)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'strong speech' that approaches the status of a sermon, but its exegetical thinness and hesitation regarding the 'two ways' prevent it from fully realizing Dekker's definition of the sermon as the 'actualization of the written Word'."
