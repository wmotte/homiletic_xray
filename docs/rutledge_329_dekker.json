And yet I am not a stranger to you, nor you to me, because tonight, more than any other night of the whole year, we are family. [...] In that look is Peter's salvation and ours. That is why it is our joy to repent and confess our sins. That is why we use white tonight, the color of purity and celebration. Our robes are washed to dazzling brightness in the blood of the Lamb. That is why we say, 'Thanks be to God.' AMEN."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon identifies a specific sentence ('The Lord turned and looked at Peter') as the core. However, it spends significant time on the Foot Washing (John 13), which is not the primary text. The 'uniqueness' of this specific Lukan detail is mentioned but often submerged in general Maundy Thursday themes.",
      "quotes": [
        "The sermon text tonight is just one Biblical sentence... 'The Lord looked at Peter.'",
        "Nowhere else in the history of religion do we see a scene like this... washing the dirty feet of mere human beings."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus exclusively on why Luke alone records this 'look' and what this specific visual encounter provides that the other Gospels' verbal accounts do not."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is thin. There is no engagement with the Greek text or the specific theological structure of Luke’s Passion narrative. The preacher relies on narrative retelling rather than scholarly exposition of the original context.",
      "quotes": [
        "Here is Luke's version: [Quotes the passage]",
        "Matthew says that Peter began to curse and swear at this point."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the linguistic weight of 'eneblepsen' (looked at/into) and the Lukan theme of the 'Lord' (Kyrios) exercising sovereignty even in bonds."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding human failure, using examples like divorce and political lies. However, it occasionally veers into general 'family' sentimentality which Dekker warns against.",
      "quotes": [
        "Half of the people who have said... 'until death us do part,' are now divorced.",
        "It isn't just politicians that say, 'I will never lie to the American people.'",
        "Ask your children about the promises you've made to them and not kept."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move away from general 'family night' metaphors and sharpen the application to the specific 'look' of God in the contemporary zeitgeist of surveillance and self-deception."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a traditional pattern: introduction, narrative retelling, then psychological/moral application. The 'present of revelation' where text and hearer merge is interrupted by long anecdotes about the preacher's father.",
      "quotes": [
        "My father had a look. He didn't use it very often, but it was scary.",
        "Let us recall what happened after the Last Supper:"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the 'sandwich' method (text then story). Let the exposition of the text itself be the application by showing how the text 'expounds' the hearer."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Strongest point. The sermon moves clearly from the misery of Peter's (and our) betrayal to the redemption found in Christ's look, ending in gratitude/celebration.",
      "quotes": [
        "Here is the archetypal unmasking of the guilty human being.",
        "In that penetrating look is the discovery that saves, the exposure that purifies, the judgment that redeems.",
        "That is why we use white tonight... 'Thanks be to God.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure 'misery' is not just psychological 'failure' but specifically 'misery before God' as a theological category."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The seriousness of being 'lost' is hinted at through the term 'traitor' and 'fraud,' but the 'two ways' are softened by the 'family' atmosphere. The possibility of final loss is not sharply articulated.",
      "quotes": [
        "That look says, 'Peter, now you know... what a fraud and a traitor you are.'",
        "The judge of all the earth exposes us as the frauds we are."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the reality that Peter’s path could have ended like Judas’s; the 'narrow way' requires a more rigorous definition of the 'ultimate possibilities of life design.'"

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon emphasizes the two natures (true humanity/divinity) and moves toward the Cross as the source of grace.",
      "quotes": [
        "The look of Jesus comes from the depths of the Holy Trinity.",
        "The judge himself, at the very moment of Peter's betrayal, is taking the judgment upon himself."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Strengthen the link between the 'look' in the courtyard and the 'substitution' on the Cross to avoid a merely moralistic view of Jesus' example."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 18 minutes, the sermon falls just short of Dekker’s 20-minute minimum for 'breadth.' The depth is somewhat compromised by the inclusion of multiple texts (John and Luke).",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section to reach the 20-minute threshold, providing the 'breadth' required for theological depth."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s ideal primarily in its lack of rigorous exegesis and its tendency toward sentimental 'family' metaphors. While it handles the 'three parts' (misery, redemption, gratitude) effectively, it lacks the 20-minute breadth and the sharp 'two ways' distinction Dekker demands. It is more of a psychological meditation than a strict exposition of a specific pericope.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' (misery, redemption, gratitude) as a background structure.",
      "Clear Christological focus, maintaining Christ as the telos of the message.",
      "Concrete application regarding human failure and the inability to keep promises."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (< 20 min) to achieve the necessary 'breadth' for depth.",
      "Weak exegesis; lacks engagement with original languages or specific Lukan theology.",
      "Over-reliance on general themes (Maundy Thursday/Family) rather than the unique content of the specific text."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate homily but a weak 'sermon' by Dekker’s standards. It prioritizes psychological resonance over the 'recreation of the Bible into a new, current, proclamatory word' through rigorous exposition."
