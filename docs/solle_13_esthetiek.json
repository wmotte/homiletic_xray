    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon employs strong, concrete imagery to ground abstract theological concepts. By introducing the figure of Simone Weil, the preacher moves from the abstract 'dying for the people' to the sensory reality of hunger and physical decline. The imagery of the 'warm mantle' for faith and the 'sea of tears' provides a tactile and visual dimension to the existential struggle. However, the biblical imagery itself remains somewhat conventional (blood, cross), relying more on the biographical narrative to provide the 'showing' rather than the 'telling'. The strength lies in the juxtaposition of the 'pigsty' of human suffering with the 'passion of God'.",
      "quotes": [
        "»Versagen des Herzens infolge Unterernährung und Lungentuberkulose.«",

      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "The sermon balances 'telling' (theological reflection) with 'showing' through the narrative of Simone Weil, though the latter half leans back into 'telling' through existential propositions."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Steffensky demonstrates high stewardship of language. He avoids 'Canaanite' jargon, or where he uses it (e.g., 'Erlösung'), he immediately deconstructs it to find its human resonance. His language is honest about the limits of understanding, using verbs like 'nachstammeln' (stammering after) to describe the act of faith. This precision in naming the difficulty of belief prevents the sermon from sliding into easy religious platitudes. The word choice is deliberate, often contrasting the 'cynical knowledge' of the world with the 'madness' of the Gospel.",
      "quotes": [
        "Dinge gibt, die wir aussprechen, sagen, nachstammeln sollen.",
        "Allzu viel Vatertheologie führt meiner Ansicht nach nur weg vom Geheimnis des Glaubens.",

        "The term 'Vatertheologie' is a shorthand that might require more nuance for a general audience."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Religious jargon is intentionally avoided or 'broken open' to reveal its existential core; 'Erlösung' is redefined as 'Standhaftigkeit der Liebe'."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a rhythmic quality, particularly through the use of antithesis and repetition. The recurring phrase 'Es ist besser/gut...' acts as a rhythmic anchor that the preacher wrestles with. There is a clear 'legato' in the narrative sections and a more 'staccato', urgent rhythm in the social-critical sections. The sentence structures are varied, often starting with a provocative statement followed by a reflective expansion. It is clearly a text written for the ear, maintaining a conversational yet poetic cadence.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ein verrückter Gott, der nirgendwo anders sein will als dort, wo das Leben geschändet wird...",
        "Die Liebe stirbt in dieser Welt der Grausamkeit und der Schwäche, das ist das Kreuz.",
        "Die Welt – erlöst, das ist einer dieser verrückten Sätze, die wir zum Leben brauchen."

      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of repetition to build a meditative atmosphere.",
        "Good variation between long, reflective sentences and short, punchy assertions.",
        "Natural flow that avoids the 'paper language' of academic theology."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The middle section regarding the political situation in Judea is slightly more 'informative' and loses some rhythmic drive.",
        "Could utilize more alliteration or assonance to heighten the poetic impact of the 'mantle' metaphor.",
        "The ending could benefit from a more rhythmic 'crescendo' before the final quote."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Oral language; the text feels like a spoken meditation/address rather than a read essay."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high micro-aesthetic quality characterized by 'sober beauty'. Steffensky avoids the baroque in favor of precise, honest, and sensory language. His imagery, particularly the biographical narrative of Simone Weil, serves as a powerful 'optical' tool to reframe the sacrifice of Christ. The musicality is found in the rhythmic wrestling with the text, creating a 'stammering' poetics that feels authentic to the modern ear. It is a prime example of 'stewardship of language' where every word is weighed for its truth-value."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'Homiletical Plot' that moves from a problematic biblical statement to a contemporary struggle for meaning. It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' by seemingly agreeing with the cynical logic of Caiaphas. The narrative arc moves through three 'scenes': the political logic of power, the radical solidarity of Simone Weil, and the existential choice of the believer. The turning point is the transition from 'dying for' (as a transaction) to 'dying with' (as solidarity). The tension is maintained by the preacher's refusal to offer a 'happy ending', ending instead on the act of 'holding on'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ich kann schon verstehen, dass dieser merkwürdige Satz ein Recht hat.",
        "Wem hat dieser Tod genutzt, mag man sich fragen, was hat er bewirkt?",

      "strengths": [
        "Strong opening that creates immediate intellectual and ethical tension.",
        "The use of Simone Weil provides a narrative 'bridge' that sustains interest.",
        "The arc respects the 'Good Friday' mood by not jumping too quickly to Easter."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition from the historical analysis of Rome to Simone Weil is a bit of a 'leap'.",
        "The 'social-critical' list (banks, environment) feels slightly tacked on to the narrative arc.",
        "The conclusion, while honest, could have a slightly more defined 'resolution' of the movement started at the beginning."

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a masterclass in 'reframing' (Cilliers). Steffensky takes the high-priestly logic of Johannes 11 and reframes it not as a dry dogma of substitutionary atonement, but as a radical 'madness' of solidarity. He connects the 'then' of the Roman occupation with the 'now' of global debt and environmental destruction, but does so through the lens of 'attention' and 'love'. The integration is organic because it doesn't just apply the text to the context; it lets the context (Weil's life) illuminate the 'double floor' of the biblical text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Diese junge Frau hat den Gott nachgeahmt, der in seinem Knecht aus Nazaret es unerträglich fand, mehr Brot zu haben...",
        "Gott will die Erlösung der Welt, aber nicht im Sinne einer Menge Blut...",
        "Gegen die Bankschulden, an deren Kreuz die Kinder der Dritten Welt verkommen."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Authentic 'reframing' of sacrifice as solidarity rather than transaction.",
        "The 'strangeness' of the biblical text is preserved and then deepened.",
        "The application flows naturally from the biographical and theological reflection."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection to 'banks' and 'environment' is brief and could be more deeply integrated into the 'solidarity' theme.",
        "Could explore the 'Jewishness' of the context more, given Simone Weil's own background.",
        "The 'double floor' (doppelter Boden) concept could be explained slightly more for the hearer."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes; it reframes 'sacrifice' from a cold political necessity into a 'mad' act of divine and human love."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Consistent with Ciska Stark's 'Open Work of Art', this sermon is remarkably open. Steffensky explicitly invites the hearer into his own doubt and 'wandering'. He does not 'seal' the sermon with a moralistic 'must' or a dogmatic 'is'. Instead, he offers faith as a 'mantle' one chooses to wrap oneself in despite the 'sea of tears'. The conclusion is an invitation to 'hold on' to the fragments of life and love, leaving the ultimate resolution of the 'absurd' vs. 'redemption' to the hearer's own existential journey.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ich maße mir nicht an, es vollkommen zu verstehen.",
        "Ich jedenfalls kann mich da nicht entscheiden...",
        "Manchmal denke ich gar: Was kümmert es mich, ob ich glauben kann!"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Avoids all forms of 'coercive' homiletics.",
        "Acknowledges the ambivalence of existence and the 'dark truth' of pain.",
        "The preacher positions himself as a fellow traveler, not an authority figure."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The openness might be unsettling for hearers seeking more 'certainty' on Good Friday.",
        "Could provide one more 'anchor' of hope without closing the openness.",
        "The 'madness' of the sentences could be balanced with a slightly more 'invitational' liturgical gesture at the end."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Highly polyvalent; it allows for doubt, resistance, and multiple layers of appropriation."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.67,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is characterized by a 'searching' dramaturgy. It avoids the static three-point sermon in favor of a narrative and existential journey. By integrating the life of Simone Weil, Steffensky creates a 'space for grace' that is not dogmatically forced but narratively evoked. The sermon is an 'open work' that respects the hearer's maturity and the mystery of the cross. The movement from political cynicism to divine solidarity provides a compelling arc that sustains tension until the very end."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is almost entirely free of religious kitsch. It explicitly rejects 'cheap comfort' and 'happy endings'. Steffensky confronts the 'stench' of the world (tears, torture, debt) without offering immediate, pre-chewed solutions. He avoids the kitsch of 'sentimentalizing' the cross, instead calling it a 'protest' and 'madness'. The emotion is authentic because it is rooted in the 'unbearable' reality of suffering. There are no clichés here; even the 'warm mantle' is presented as a desperate necessity rather than a cozy decoration.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None identified; the sermon actively deconstructs kitsch-prone concepts like 'Sühne' (atonement).",
      "The rejection of 'Vatertheologie' acts as a safeguard against patriarchal-dogmatic kitsch."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission of not being able to decide between faith and darkness.",
      "The description of Simone Weil's 'senseless' but loving death."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of 'aesthetic asceticism'; the refusal to provide easy answers is the sermon's greatest strength."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Steffensky creates a significant 'Space for Grace' by refusing to 'manage' God or the cross. By defining God as 'mad' and 'passionate', he opens a space where the Holy can happen in the midst of 'schändet' (desecrated) life. He sustains the tension between the 'absurd' and 'redemption' without resolving it cheaply. The sermon does not moralize; it witnesses. Grace is not a 'task' we perform, but a 'standhaftigkeit' (steadfastness) of love that we 'hold on to'.",
    "tension_sustained": "High; the tension between doubt and faith is the very engine of the sermon.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes; the preacher repeatedly admits to 'not understanding' and 'stammering'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails as a 'gift' of solidarity, though it calls for a 'radical' response of attention.",
    "recommendation": "To further open space, the preacher could perhaps lean even more into the 'unavailable' (unverfügbar) nature of the Resurrection at the end."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically sophisticated meditation that exemplifies the 'aesthetic turn' in homiletics. It moves away from the 'vertical' proclamation of dogmatic truths toward a 'horizontal' and 'existential' exploration of the mystery of the cross. The poetics of language are sober and precise, avoiding religious kitsch in favor of authentic, 'stammering' speech. The dramaturgy is narrative and open, using the life of Simone Weil as a powerful 'reframing' device that allows the hearer to see the sacrifice of Christ not as a cold transaction, but as a radical act of solidarity. The sermon succeeds aesthetically because it 'shows' the weight of the world's pain before 'showing' the lightness of the mantle of faith. It respects the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed tradition while embracing the polyvalence of modern literary sensibilities.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Authentic and honest 'searching' tone that avoids religious kitsch.",
      "Powerful reframing of the biblical text through the narrative of Simone Weil.",
      "Stewardship of language that translates complex theology into 'human' terms."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Strengthen the sensory 'painting' of the biblical scenes.",
      "More organic integration of the 'social-critical' list into the narrative flow.",
      "Slightly more attention to the 'musical' crescendo of the liturgical ending."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Poetic-Existential / Sober-Reformed",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Ciska Stark (Open Work of Art).",
    "audience_analysis": "Appeals to intellectually honest, perhaps skeptical or 'searching' hearers who are wary of dogmatic certainty but hungry for authentic meaning.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'sensory' descriptions of the biblical landscape.",
      "Deepen the 'dramatic' interaction between the biblical characters.",
      "Maintain the 'open ending' as a signature aesthetic move."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, aesthetically 'honest' sermon that serves as an excellent example of how to preach on Good Friday in a secularized context. It avoids the pitfalls of both dry intellectualism and sentimental kitsch, creating instead a 'space' where the hearer can encounter the 'madness' of God's love. The score of 7.8 reflects its excellence in language and structure, falling just short of a 'model' score only due to minor structural leaps and a slightly conventional use of some metaphors."
