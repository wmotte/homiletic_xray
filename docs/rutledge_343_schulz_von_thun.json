  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates strong exegetical competence, particularly in the analysis of the 'great triple passive' in the Greek text. The theological 'Sache' is clearly defined through the lens of apocalyptic theology (the invasion of the Age to Come into the Old Age). The distinction between the chronological movement of time (past-present-future) and the Christological interruption is handled with intellectual precision. However, the use of scholarly references like Paul Minear and T.S. Eliot, while enriching, risks creating a lecture-like atmosphere where the 'fides quae' (doctrine) overshadows the 'fides qua' (living faith) for a less academic listener.",
      "quotes": [
        "In Greek there is a triple passive it has even been called 'the great triple passive'",
        "Fundamental to understanding the New Testament is the concept of the two ages",
        "The universe is wrenched off its axis and sent spinning in another direction."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Precise linguistic observation of the biblical text.",
        "Clear systematic-theological framework (Two-Ages doctrine)."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Reduce reliance on academic 'authorities' to allow the text to speak more directly.",
        "Bridge the gap between the 'cosmic' event and the 'local' reality earlier."
      ],
      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The concepts are complex but explained through relatable lists (politics, sports, taxes)."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher remains largely behind the 'office' of the Word. There is very little personal 'I' in the sense of biographical vulnerability. The self-revelation is primarily that of a teacher or a guardian of the tradition. One 'leaks' a certain disdain for 'futuristic thinking' and 'Corinthian' Christians (those who prefer Easter over Good Friday), suggesting a preacher who values theological rigor over popular sentiment. The 'I' only appears in the context of intellectual determination ('I determined to know nothing among you...').",
      "quotes": [
        "One of the worst things that can be said about a preacher is, 'She's not in touch with the real world.'",
        "How fortunate we are today to be here.",
        "This is nothing like the futuristic thinking so beloved by the Speaker of the House."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive/Schizoid. The focus is on correctness, structure, and the 'objective' cosmic shift rather than personal emotional connection or harmonic seeking.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is subservient to the text, but perhaps too distant to be fully 'incarnational'.",
      "strengths": [
        "Avoids narcissistic psychologization.",
        "Professional and focused on the 'Sache'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could benefit from more 'Selbstenthüllung' regarding the struggle of faith.",
        "The tone is slightly detached from the 'agonized' subject matter."
      ]
    },
    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching-Learning'. The preacher addresses the congregation as 'we', but it is a 'we' of theological consensus rather than shared vulnerability. There is a subtle 'from above' quality when critiquing those who only come on Easter Day. However, toward the end, the preacher moves to a more 'Solidary' stance by listing common human 'prisons' (fear of failure, jealousy, aging), which bridges the distance created by the earlier academic tone.",
      "quotes": [
        "Many who come only on Easter Day will not fully grasp the dimensions...",
        "What is your prison door?",
        "God... makes you and me and the whole creation new."
      ],
      "relationship_noise_check": "The critique of the 'Speaker of the House' or 'Corinthian' Christians may create noise for listeners who feel judged or distracted by political/historical asides.",
      "attitude_indication": "Teaching/Solidary (transitioning from teacher to pastor in the final third).",
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of 'we' to include the congregation in the cosmic event.",
        "Strong pastoral application in the final section."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Avoid the 'us vs. them' (Easter-only people) rhetoric.",
        "Ensure the 'teaching' tone doesn't become patronizing."
      ]
    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the strongest side of the sermon because it avoids the trap of moralism. The appeal is not 'do better,' but 'behold what God has done.' The 'Anspruch' (demand) is entirely derived from the 'Zuspruch' (promise). The preacher asks the listener to identify their 'prison,' but the solution is the 'unconditional love' of Christ, not human effort. It is a call to faith and a change of orientation (metanoia) rather than a checklist of behaviors.",
      "quotes": [
        "We orient ourselves not to what we have been, but to what by the grace of God we shall be.",
        "Jesus' unconditional love... has changed everything.",
        "His death has set us free."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Excellent. The Gospel (Gift) clearly precedes and enables the response.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Very low. The sermon is profoundly anti-moralistic.",
      "strengths": [
        "Theological integrity in maintaining the priority of Grace.",
        "Translates cosmic 'signs' into personal liberation."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition from 'cosmic earthquake' to 'personal jealousy' is a bit abrupt.",
        "Could sharpen the 'call to praise' as a concrete response."

  "congruence_and_disruptions": {
    "congruence_judgment": "High congruence. The sober, slightly intellectual tone matches the 'Compulsive' Riemann type and the Barthian focus on God as the Acting Subject.",
    "dominant_side": "Blue (Factual/Theological)",
    "disruptions": "A slight 'Yellow' noise occurs when the preacher critiques 'Easter-only' attendees, which might make the 'Appeal' ear of a visitor feel unwelcome.",
    "healing_disruption": "The interruption of the 'past-present-future' logic is a genuine 'disruption of the Spirit' that challenges the listener's worldview."
  },
  "reception_simulation": {
    "the_factual_ear_hears": "A sophisticated explanation of Matthew's apocalyptic theology and the Greek grammar of the Passion.",
    "the_relational_ear_hears": "A teacher who is a bit strict about attendance but ultimately cares about my 'prisons' of fear and aging.",
    "the_appeal_ear_hears": "Stop looking at your past; look at what God is doing from the future. Trust in the reversal.",
    "the_self_revelation_ear_hears": "A preacher who values theological depth, likely well-read, and slightly suspicious of superficial 'Easter' joy."
  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7,
    "summary": "The sermon is a robust example of theologically-driven homiletics. It successfully avoids the 'psychologization' that Karl Barth warned against by keeping God as the primary Subject of the action (the 'triple passive'). The preacher uses the 'Blue' side (Factual/Theological) to dismantle the listener's 'Real World' and replace it with the 'Age to Come.' While the 'Green' side (Self-revelation) is somewhat muted, the 'Red' side (Appeal) is masterfully handled, ensuring that the Gospel remains a promise (Zuspruch) rather than a law (Anspruch). The transition from the cosmic (earthquakes, splitting rocks) to the existential (jealousy, fear of aging) is effective, though it could be more fluid. The sermon's greatest strength is its refusal to turn the Cross into a mere moral example, insisting instead on its status as a cosmic 'invasion' that reverses the direction of human life.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon avoids unhealthy psychologization by focusing on the 'Extra Nos' (outside of us) work of God. It does not pin revelation on human experience but judges experience by revelation.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological depth and clarity regarding the 'Two Ages'.",
      "Avoidance of moralism in the 'Appeal' side.",
      "Strong exegetical grounding in the biblical text."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Softening the 'Yellow' side to be more inclusive of 'Easter-only' seekers.",
      "Increasing 'Green' authenticity to bridge the intellectual distance.",
      "Smoothing the transition between cosmic theology and personal application."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A high-quality, 'Ample Satisfactory' to 'Good' sermon that serves the Word with integrity and psychological sobriety."
