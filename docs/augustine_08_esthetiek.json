    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating a cosmic, visual landscape. It employs light/dark dualism and sensory metaphors effectively. The imagery of the 'Good Thief' following the 'King of kings' and the 'chains of hell bursting asunder' provides a cinematic quality. However, the imagery remains largely within the realm of the 'sublime' and 'celestial,' lacking the 'stench' or 'earthiness' that Paul Scott Wilson advocates for to ground the message in human reality. It paints a glorious picture of the resurrection but stays within a traditional, almost iconographic frame. The metaphors are 'living' in a liturgical sense but may feel 'dead' to a modern ear if not for the vivid descriptions of the 'murk of barbarous nations' and 'shattered chains.'",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is dignified and exhibits 'stewardship of language' in its liturgical precision. It avoids modern slang but is heavily saturated in 'Canaanite' or ecclesiastical jargon (e.g., 'netherworld,' 'elect,' 'mystical veil'). While this fits the liturgical context, it risks obscuring the radicality of the message behind a veneer of sacredness. The precision is found in the theological distinctions—such as the difference between earthly bread and the living bread. However, the use of 'barbarous nations' and 'murk' lacks the nuance McEntyre calls for, using broad strokes rather than precise human observation.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let us take our fill of the bread of grace rather than the murk of barbarous nations.",
        "A mystical veil had wrapped the Old Law, but was torn as 'the night ended and day was dawning.'",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest aesthetic feature. It is deeply rhythmic, utilizing parallelism, anaphora, and antithesis. The repetitive use of 'This is the day the Lord has made' acts as a rhythmic refrain. The sentence structures are balanced—often following a 'he suffered... he rose... he ascended' cadence that creates a sense of liturgical dance. It is clearly an 'oral event' designed for the ear, not the eye. The movement from 'mourning into dancing' is reflected in the very tempo of the prose, which accelerates as it moves toward the doxological conclusion.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Lord was born, and the world was renewed; he suffered, and mankind was saved; he rose from the tomb, and hell moaned and groaned.",
        "This day brings no black clouds, because it first has dispelled them. It comprises no darkness, because it has driven all darkness away.",
        "Boundless, free, rapturous and radiant, this day is like 'a thousand years in the presence of God'."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Purely oral language; highly rhetorical and performative."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high degree of rhetorical polish. Its strength lies in its musicality and rhythmic cadences, which mirror the liturgical joy of Easter. The imagery is cosmic and grand, successfully 'painting' the resurrection as a universal event. However, it suffers from a lack of 'earthy' precision, relying on traditional ecclesiastical categories that can feel distant. It is a 'sober-beautiful' text that prioritizes the dignity of the Word over modern psychological nuance, yet it achieves a poetic density that makes the 'holy happen' through sound and image."
  },
  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon lacks a traditional 'Lowry' plot or a movement from 'upsetting the equilibrium' to resolution. Instead, it is a static, celebratory 'state of being.' It begins in the light and ends in the light. While there is a brief mention of 'dark night of struggling' and 'mourning,' these are treated as past-tense realities already resolved. There is no 'trouble' (in Wilson's terms) that the hearer must navigate during the sermon itself. The movement is more like a spiral—circling around the same theme of joy—rather than a journey from A to B. It is a 'hymn' in prose form rather than a narrative arc.",
      "quotes": [
        "A dazzling light shines for us today...",
        "After our dark night of struggling, gladsome light radiates upon us...",
        "Whoever perseveres... will merit the grace of delighting eternally in this day."

      "strengths": [
        "Maintains a high energy level from start to finish.",

      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Introduce a more palpable sense of the 'not yet' to create tension.",
        "Allow the 'moaning of hell' or the 'downcast Apostles' to be felt more deeply before the resolution.",
        "Create a clearer 'turning point' where the gospel specifically addresses a present conflict."

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The integration of contemporary context is the weakest element. The 'context' is almost entirely liturgical/ecclesial. There is a brief, interesting mention of 'plain clothing' vs. 'dignity,' which hints at a social context of vanity or poverty, but it is not developed. The sermon operates in a 'sacred time' that is largely disconnected from the 'secular time' of the hearer. It does not 'reframe' modern reality so much as it invites the hearer to escape it for a 'mystical' reality. The 'barbarous nations' reference is the only nod to an external world, and it is pejorative rather than integrative.",
      "quotes": [
        "May no one be saddened if he feels pressured to celebrate life rather than maintain his 'dignity.'",
        "Let no one ever again desire earthly bread...",
        "They walked about the holy city of Jerusalem, but we shall go to our holy mother the Church."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong connection between the Old Testament (Temple veil, Old Law) and the New Event.",
        "Effective 'reframing' of the Apostles' grief into happiness.",
        "Successful 'mystagogy'—explaining the meaning of the ritual (altar, banquet)."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Connect the 'chains of sin' to specific contemporary social or personal bondages.",
        "Develop the 'clothing vs. mind' section into a more robust critique of contemporary values.",
        "Bridge the gap between the 'holy city' and the actual city where the hearers live."

      "reframing_present": "Confirms the liturgical frame; offers little reframing of the 'outside' world."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is relatively 'closed.' It is a 'monovalent' proclamation of victory that leaves little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or the 'not yet.' It uses coercive language ('Let us all say,' 'May no one be saddened'). While this is appropriate for a festal homily, it does not function as an 'open work of art' where the hearer can bring their own doubt or resistance. The 'happy ending' is not just the conclusion; it is the entire sermon. It risks becoming 'kitsch' by resolving all tension too quickly, though the sheer rhetorical power saves it from superficiality.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let us all say, 'This is the day of light...'",
        "May no one be saddened...",
        "It comprises no darkness, because it has driven all darkness away."

      "strengths": [
        "Offers a clear, unambiguous source of hope.",

      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Acknowledge that for many, 'black clouds' still exist despite the Resurrection.",
        "Use more 'open' questions rather than imperatives.",
        "Leave space for the 'silence' of the tomb before the 'Alleluia'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Closed/Monovalent; a declarative system of truths."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 4.67,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is liturgical and cyclical rather than narrative. It functions as a high-energy proclamation that sustains a single note of triumph. While this creates a powerful 'event' of praise, it lacks the 'homiletical plot' that engages the hearer's current struggles. The integration of text and context is minimal, favoring a retreat into the 'sacred space' of the Church. It is an aesthetically 'closed' work that prioritizes the objective reality of the Resurrection over the subjective appropriation of the hearer."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon narrowly avoids religious kitsch through its 'sober beauty' and high rhetorical standards. Kitsch often involves 'cheap comfort,' and while this sermon is entirely comforting, it roots that comfort in a cosmic, bloody sacrifice ('stamped with his blood') rather than mere sentiment. However, the dismissal of all 'black clouds' and 'darkness' borders on kitsch because it denies the ongoing reality of human suffering. It is saved by its 'authentic aesthetic depth'—the language is too strong and the theological stakes too high for it to be 'pre-chewed' sentiment. It is 'grand' rather than 'cute.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The assertion that 'this day brings no black clouds'—a potential denial of the hearer's lived reality.",
      "The somewhat simplistic resolution of the Apostles' 'downcast' state."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The image of the 'Good Thief' following the King—a gritty, authentic gospel paradox.",
      "The mention of 'hell moaning and groaning'—a visceral, non-sentimental image of victory."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To increase depth, the preacher should allow the 'shadow of death' (Ps 22) to feel more threatening before it is dispelled, ensuring the comfort is 'earned' rhetorically."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) created by the liturgical event. The sermon emphasizes that salvation is 'merited' by the Redeemer's innocence, not the hearer's effort. However, the space is partially closed by moralizing imperatives at the end ('Whoever perseveres... will merit'). The 'mystery' is respected in the language of 'mystical veils' and 'ineffable relief,' but the sermon's refusal to sit with the 'already/not yet' tension limits the 'inter-esse' space where most hearers live.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are resolved very quickly; the 'already' heavily outweighs the 'not yet'.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, the use of 'mystical' and 'ineffable' language maintains a sense of the Holy.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the imagery, but moralization appears in the 'dignity' and 'perseverance' sections.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'Apostles' downcast' state to linger; grace is most spacious when it meets us in our 'downcast' reality."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is a rhetorically sophisticated example of classical homiletics. Its primary aesthetic value lies in its 'Poetics of Language' (Domain A), specifically its musicality and rhythmic cadence. It functions as a 'Performance' (Immink) where the 'holy happens' through the proclamation of Christ's victory. The text creates a 'dazzling' atmosphere that successfully lifts the hearer out of the mundane. However, from the perspective of the 'Aesthetic Turn,' it is limited by its closed structure and lack of contextual 'reframing.' It operates as a 'closed work of art'—a beautiful, polished jewel that the hearer observes and admires, rather than an 'open work' they can inhabit with their own brokenness. The 'Space for Grace' is present but feels somewhat 'sealed' by the overwhelming emphasis on a triumph that has already dispelled all darkness, leaving little room for the 'lament' that often accompanies faith.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Superb rhetorical rhythm and parallelism that creates a 'liturgical throb'.",
      "Vivid, cosmic imagery of the Resurrection (the moaning hell, the Good Thief).",
      "Strong 'Christus Victor' theology that avoids shallow moralism."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Lack of connection to the 'secular' or everyday context of the hearer.",
      "A 'closed' narrative structure that resolves tension too quickly.",
      "Over-reliance on ecclesiastical jargon which can create aesthetic distance."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Classical-Rhetorical (High Style)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Gerrit Immink's 'Performance' and 'Event' focus; lacks Paul Scott Wilson's 'Trouble' or Ciska Stark's 'Openness'.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who find spiritual resonance in tradition, liturgy, and the 'sublime' will be deeply moved; those seeking 'practical' or 'authentic-struggle' preaching may find it distant.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Incorporate a 'Page 1' (Trouble in the Text) and 'Page 2' (Trouble in the World) to ground the 'Grace'.",
      "Experiment with 'open endings' that leave the hearer with a question rather than a command.",
      "Use one 'earthy' metaphor (e.g., the smell of the garden, the dust of the road) to anchor the cosmic light."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically 'good' (6.2) example of the 'Sober-Beautiful' tradition. It excels in its internal poetic logic and rhythmic power, making it a compelling liturgical 'event.' Its deficiencies lie in its macro-aesthetic structure, which is too closed and lacks the 'reframing' necessary to bridge the gap between the 'dazzling light' of the pulpit and the 'shadowed valleys' of the pews. It is a masterpiece of 'telling' the glory, but it needs more 'showing' of the grace as it intersects with a broken world."
