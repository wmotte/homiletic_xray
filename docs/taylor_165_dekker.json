    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon focuses on a single verse, but fails Dekker's requirement of finding what is unique to THIS passage. Instead of exploring the specific character of Lot's wife or the unique context of Luke 17, the preacher uses the text as a springboard for general themes of judgment and earnestness found elsewhere in the Bible.",
      "quotes": [
        "The text, 'Remember Lot's wife,' grew out of some stern and urgent words our Lord was speaking about judgment",
        "Jesus picked up the account a thousand and more years later telling us that we must turn from what is low and foul"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify what the specific figure of Lot's wife reveals about the nature of judgment that the 'wheat and tares' or 'sheep and goats' do not. Focus on the 'backward glance' as a specific theological category."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is a narrative reconstruction of the Genesis 19 context, but it lacks the academic rigor Dekker demands (Hebrew/Greek/theology of the book). It relies on imaginative description ('palm trees waved') rather than exegetical depth. The connection between the Lucan context and the Genesis event is superficial.",
      "quotes": [
        "Sodom seems to have been a scene of luxuriant vegetation, an oasis surrounded by barren and rocky country.",
        "The Book of Genesis tells of how Lot journeyed with his uncle, Abraham"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond descriptive storytelling. Analyze the specific Lucan eschatology of Luke 17 and why Jesus invokes the 'days of Lot' specifically in relation to the suddenness of the Son of Man."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application attempts concreteness by referencing the atomic bomb and Hiroshima, which aligns with Dekker's interest in the zeitgeist. However, it quickly reverts to general moralizing ('turn from filth toward decency') which Dekker explicitly forbids as 'general truths'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The atomic bomb which we dropped on Hiroshima... is present in our new weapons of destruction.",
        "From filth, turn toward decency. From fleshiness, turn toward spirituality."

      "improvement_point": "Replace the list of general binary oppositions (doubt/faith, fear/trust) with a concrete analysis of how the 'Sodom' of the current cultural moment specifically entices the modern hearer to look back."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured in blocks: first a general discourse on Jesus' earnestness, then a block on modern warfare, then a retelling of the Genesis story. The 'present of revelation' where text and hearer converge is interrupted by these thematic shifts.",
      "quotes": [
        "Old-fashioned talk, did you say? ... Maybe you ought to read your daily newspaper.",
        "Jesus was so deeply moved... that he reaches back over the waste of many centuries"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the 'sandwich' method. Let the exposition of the text itself provide the application simultaneously, so the hearer is 'expounded' along with the verse."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The category of 'misery' (judgment/lostness) is strongly present. 'Redemption' is offered as a 'shelter'. However, the 'gratitude' part is somewhat sentimentalized toward the end, losing the Trinitarian grounding Dekker seeks.",
      "quotes": [
        "this blazing earnestness in our Lord... with the love of God and what an awful thing it is to reject his love",
        "We have a shelter and a hiding place and a way through the fiery trial."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'gratitude' section is a rigorous response to the specific redemption offered in the text, rather than a general 'bright side' optimism."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is the strongest aspect of the sermon. It takes the possibility of being lost (both temporal and eternal) with the 'blazing earnestness' Dekker requires. It rejects 'pulpit scare tactics' while maintaining the gravity of the choice.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus speaks most pointedly about the future, about judgment, about souls being welcomed by God and others sent away.",
        "There is a point of no return. Lot was warned to get out."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'two ways' more directly to the specific action of 'remembering' or 'looking back' rather than just general 'good vs evil' choices."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is the speaker and the example of earnestness, but He is less clearly the 'telos' (goal) or the 'life outside ourselves'. The sermon leans toward a call to human willpower ('stop going the way you are now going') rather than Christ as the only life man has.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus was so deeply moved, so passionately earnest...",
        "What you do for Jesus is all that will matter in the final totaling of things."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Shift the focus from Jesus as a teacher of warning to Christ as the one who is the 'shelter' Himself, detaching the hearer from their own ability to 'turn'."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1,450 words, the sermon lasts roughly 14-15 minutes. According to Thesis 8, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for true depth. It lacks the theological 'weight' Dekker expects from a minister.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical and dogmatic background. The sermon moves too quickly to moral appeal without dwelling in the 'breadth' of the biblical witness."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s standard primarily due to its brevity and its tendency toward general moralizing. While it correctly identifies the 'two ways' and the seriousness of judgment, it lacks the rigorous exegetical foundation and the 'mixed' exposition-application structure required. The duration is significantly below the 20-minute threshold for 'depth'.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong emphasis on the 'two ways' and the reality of being lost, avoiding modern liberal avoidance of judgment.",
      "Effective use of contemporary 'zeitgeist' (atomic threat) to ground the concept of 'unquenchable fire'.",
      "Clear focus on the 'earnestness' of Jesus as a theological necessity."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (approx. 14 mins) preventing theological 'breadth'.",
      "Reliance on general moral binaries rather than specific truths unique to the pericope.",
      "Lack of visible academic exegesis (languages, context of the biblical book)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'speech about the gospel' and a 'moral warning' rather than a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense. It lacks the formal requirements of length and specific exegetical depth to be considered a full actualization of the Word of God."
