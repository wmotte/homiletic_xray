    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is rhetorically powerful but psychologically taxing. It heavily utilizes the Critical Parent to establish a 'cosmology of fear,' framing the Christian life as a mandatory endurance of suffering and humiliation. While it aims for 'transcendence,' it often achieves this by diminishing the listener's current reality ('our own little lives') and replacing it with a high-stakes drama of demonic warfare. This risks creating a dependency on the preacher's 'vision' and a 'suffering-as-validation' complex in the listener.",

      "High reliance on 'Ain't It Awful' dynamics regarding culture.",
      "The definition of 'true worship' is framed through a Critical Parent lens (exclusionary).",
      "Over-emphasis on suffering as the primary marker of authentic faith."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation more frequently as Adult-to-Adult. Instead of 'must' and 'should,' use 'how might we' or 'consider the evidence.' Reduce the 'Bait & Switch' between grace and suffering by presenting grace as a present reality rather than a post-suffering reward."
