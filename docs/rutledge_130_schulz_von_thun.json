  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a robust intellectual framework by contrasting contemporary skepticism (Jesus Seminar) with classical orthodoxy (Raymond Brown). The 'Sache' is the historicity and necessity of the Resurrection. The blue side is well-developed; the preacher avoids vague spiritualization by insisting on the 'identifiable spot' of burial. However, the theological depth is primarily reactive—it defines the faith against its detractors rather than exploring the dogmatic richness of the Resurrection in its own right. The use of 1 Cor 15:17 provides a solid Barthian foundation: if the event is not factual, the faith is futile. The factual content serves to stabilize the hearer's intellect against media-driven doubt, though it occasionally borders on a lecture about New Testament scholarship.",
      "quotes": [
        "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins.",
        "The Jesus Seminar has come up with the imaginative suggestion that the body of Jesus was thrown into a common grave and eaten by dogs.",
        "Christianity stands or falls on the question of divine revelation."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear distinction between 'man-made religion' and 'divine revelation'.",
        "Effective use of contemporary scholarly foils to sharpen the point."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Risk of becoming too 'news-heavy', potentially dating the sermon.",
        "Could deepen the christological 'Sache' beyond the historical-critical debate."

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The preacher translates complex scholarly debates into accessible congregational language."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher displays significant vulnerability, moving beyond mere 'image management'. By admitting to 'fresh doubts' and 'going through the motions' during Evening Prayer, the preacher models the very struggle the sermon addresses. This is not a 'hysterical' use of the pulpit for therapy, but a 'diaconal' self-revelation that serves the text. The 'I' is used to bridge the gap between the biblical Thomas and the modern listener. The revelation of personal grief (three friends dead in five weeks) provides a somber, authentic weight to the message. It is a controlled but honest 'Selbstenthüllung' that validates the congregation's own struggles.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is a very comforting thing to me, in my own struggle to believe...",
        "I felt that I was just going through the motions. My 'inner voice' was saying all sorts of treacherous things.",
        "I have been dealing with a lot of death close to me lately."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive-Compulsive blend. The preacher seeks closeness and harmony with the suffering (Depressive) but anchors this in a strict adherence to the 'correct' Word and tradition (Compulsive) to ward off the chaos of doubt.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is exemplary in its service to the text; the preacher's doubt is the stage upon which the Word performs its work.",
      "strengths": [
        "High degree of authenticity regarding the difficulty of faith.",
        "Avoids the 'triumphant preacher' persona."

        "The focus on personal grief, while powerful, must be careful not to overshadow the communal 'We'."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as one of solidarity in struggle. The preacher speaks 'at eye level', placing themselves in the same position as Thomas and the congregation. There is a clear 'We-definition' regarding the 'hard-core faithful' who attend on Low Sunday. However, there is a slight 'teaching' distance when discussing the Jesus Seminar and New Age thinking, where the preacher adopts a more paternalistic/protective stance against 'trendy disaffections'. The relationship noise is minimal, though the sharp dismissal of 'Marla Maples' or 'socialites' might create a barrier for seekers who identify with those 'New Age' searches.",
      "quotes": [
        "Thomas stands for all of us here.",
        "The people who are in church... are, for the most part, the hard-core faithful.",
        "We can all rejoice that there has been a significant counterblast..."

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily an invitation to trust (Faith/Rest) rather than a demand for moral action. The preacher correctly identifies that the Word creates faith, which is a theological 'Zuspruch' (Promise). The 'Anspruch' (Demand) is to reject the 'domesticated household pet' god and submit to the 'baffling God'. The ratio is heavily weighted toward the Gospel as a gift that 'calls into existence things that do not exist'. The preacher avoids moralism, focusing instead on the 'freedom' found in a Resurrection that is not self-generated. The appeal is: 'Do not settle for a god of your own making.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Do not be faithless, but believing.",
        "We have a real choice. We can choose a god who suits us... or the Bible sets before us a baffling, even an infuriating God.",
        "The Word of Jesus can create faith where there is no faith."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Excellent. The promise of the Word's power precedes the call to believe.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Low. The sermon focuses on the ontological reality of the Resurrection rather than behavioral change.",
      "strengths": [
        "The appeal is rooted in the character of God, not the effort of the human.",
        "Clear call to 'hold on' to a promise."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'choice' between gods could be framed less as a cognitive decision and more as a response to being 'found' by the Word."

    "congruence_judgment": "Highly congruent. The preacher's somber tone matches the content of grief and the intellectual struggle with doubt.",
    "dominant_side": "Green (Self-revelation) and Blue (Factual Content) are in a tight dialectic.",
    "disruptions": "A slight disruption occurs between the 'solidarity' of the yellow side and the 'polemical' sharpness of the blue side regarding the Jesus Seminar.",
    "healing_disruption": "The introduction of the Alabama tornado serves as a 'healing disruption', forcing the congregation to move from intellectual debate to the 'place of ambiguity and pain' where the Resurrection actually matters."

  "reception_simulation": {
    "the_factual_ear_hears": "The Resurrection is a historical claim supported by scholars like Raymond Brown; the Jesus Seminar's 'dog-eaten' theory is a desperate fiction.",
    "the_relational_ear_hears": "The preacher is one of us; they struggle with the same doubts and griefs I do. I am safe to ask 'Why?' here.",
    "the_appeal_ear_hears": "I must stop trying to invent my own spirituality and listen to the external Word of God.",
    "the_self_revelation_ear_hears": "The preacher is currently in a period of mourning and is finding their own strength in the liturgy they perform."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a sophisticated exercise in homiletical honesty. It successfully navigates the tension between the 'Hamburg school' of psychological clarity and the 'Barthian' insistence on the Word as an external Subject. By grounding the 'Green' side (personal doubt) in the 'Blue' side (the factual promise of the Resurrection), the preacher avoids the pitfall of mere psychologization. The sermon functions as a 'diaconal' act, where the preacher’s own vulnerability serves to validate the congregation's experience of 'Low Sunday'. Theologically, it aligns with Immink’s view of God as the Acting Subject: it is the Word that 'creates faith' during the reading of the lesson, not the preacher's rhetorical skill. The critique of 'New Age' and 'man-made' religion serves to protect the 'Otherness' of God, a classic Barthian move. While the polemics against the Jesus Seminar are a bit dated, the underlying communicative movement—from doubt through the wounds of Christ to the Word—is timeless and effective.",
    "barthian_warning": "The preacher avoids unhealthy psychologization by explicitly rejecting the 'inner voice' as the source of truth, pointing instead to the 'Word of the Lord' that comes from outside.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Authentic integration of personal grief and liturgical practice.",
      "Strong theological distinction between 'projection' and 'revelation'.",
      "Effective use of the 'wounds' of Jesus as the bridge between doubt and faith."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce the reliance on specific 1994 media figures to ensure the 'Blue' side remains timeless.",
      "Soften the 'Yellow' side's tone toward those outside the 'hard-core faithful'.",
      "Deepen the 'Red' side by exploring the 'Life in His name' beyond just 'not doubting'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, congruent sermon that uses psychological vulnerability to point toward a robust theological reality. It is a model of how to preach 'at eye level' without losing the authority of the Word."
