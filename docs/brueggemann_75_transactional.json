    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely game-free. It operates from a strong Adult ego state, inviting the listener into a reflective process regarding their identity. By identifying 'anxiety' and 'power' as 'seductions,' the preacher helps the listener externalize dysfunctional patterns (Adapted Child) and move toward an autonomous, grounded identity (Free Child/Adult). The use of 'we' prevents a Persecutor/Victim dynamic between the pulpit and the pew.",

      "Slight risk of 'Nurturing Parent' becoming 'Smothering' if the identity is too rigidly defined by the preacher.",
      "The critique of 'U.S. citizens' could lean toward 'Critical Parent' if not balanced with the shared 'we'."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' to maintain solidarity. Ensure that the 'Free Child' elements (joy, spontaneity) are not just described historically but invited in the present moment of the liturgy."
