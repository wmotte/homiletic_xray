It utilizes a 'Birth' metaphor to bypass the listener's Adult ego and speak directly to the Adapted Child's sense of guilt. By labeling the listener's need for safety as 'stupid' and 'unwise,' the preacher occupies a high Critical Parent position. While the goal (authentic living) is noble, the method relies on shaming the listener's current state of 'jadedness' to manufacture a 'second birth.'",

Instead of telling them they are 'hiding in the womb' (Parental judgment), present the 'public life' as a viable option for a thinking subject to choose, acknowledging the valid Adult reasons why one might fear 'Herod' without shaming that fear."
