    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of prophetic rhetoric that heavily utilizes the Critical Parent. While theologically and politically passionate, it risks 'smothering' the listener's Adult ego by replacing personal conscience with a pre-packaged list of 'Buße' (repentance) items. The psychological impact is likely a mix of guilt and a temporary 'high' of moral clarity, which often leads to exhaustion rather than sustainable autonomy.",

      "Over-reliance on CP shaming ('Hat man dir das Nachdenken verboten?').",
      "Narrow definition of 'God's hands' that excludes those not in the preacher's specific political camp.",
      "High risk of inducing 'Adapted Child' compliance rather than 'Adult' conviction."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try asking Adult-Adult questions that allow the congregation to discover their own 'Buße' rather than prescribing it. Reduce the use of the 'Drama Triangle' by not portraying the world solely as a 'Todesmaschine' vs. 'The Minority', which fosters an 'Us vs. Them' psychological script."
