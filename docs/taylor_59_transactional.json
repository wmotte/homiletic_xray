  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exemplary model of psychologically healthy homiletics. It avoids the common trap of the Critical Parent (demanding 'greater works' as a law) and instead uses the Adult ego state to investigate a theological difficulty. By being vulnerable about his own 50-year struggle with the text, the preacher eliminates the power imbalance often found in the pulpit. The conclusion moves into a hopeful Free Child/Nurturing Parent space that inspires rather than coerces.",

      "Avoidance of guilt-based motivation."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The imaginative scenario about Jerusalem is effective but could lean toward 'Ain't it Awful' if the focus stayed on the difficulty of travel; however, he uses it well to prove a point."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'I-position' (sharing personal struggle) as it successfully prevents the 'Preacher-as-Persecutor' dynamic."
