    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of 'Prophetic Shaming.' While the theological and political points may be valid, the psychological delivery is heavily coercive. It relies on inducing 'Adapted Child' guilt rather than 'Adult' responsibility. By framing the enjoyment of culture (Bach) as potentially 'mendacious,' it creates a double-bind for the listener: feel guilty for your joy, or abandon your tradition.",
