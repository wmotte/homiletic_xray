    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a strong, self-deprecating concrete experience—the preacher's own 'anguish' and 'lead-footed' nature in the presence of jazz. It successfully evokes the sensory world of the 'barrio' and 'slave huts.' However, it stays largely within historical or metaphorical experience rather than contemporary, everyday situations of the hearer, which slightly limits the immediate 'feeling' connection for a modern audience not living in a literal barrio.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Reflection is present primarily through cultural and social critique. The preacher pauses to analyze why the 'song' is uncomfortable for different groups (conservatives, liberals, etc.). It explores the 'problem' of the church growing old and weary. However, the analysis of 'why' the church has become stale is somewhat brief and relies on a list of symptoms rather than a deep dive into the underlying human condition.",

The sermon provides a sweeping theological framework that links disparate biblical texts (Exodus to Revelation) under the 'theme and variation' concept. It formulates a clear 'big idea': the Gospel is a recurring theme of God's subversion of settled power. The exegesis is not technical but is structurally profound, creating a logical 'score' for the biblical narrative.",

It succeeds remarkably in the 'Visionary' and 'Abstract Conceptualization' phases, providing a compelling 'big idea' that unifies the biblical narrative. It effectively critiques modern ecclesiastical stagnation. However, it falls short of a complete Kolb cycle due to a significant lack of 'Active Experimentation.' The application is largely rhetorical and posturing rather than concrete and practical. While it addresses the 'Assimilating' and 'Diverging' learning styles with excellence, the 'Converging' learner—who asks 'How does this work in my life?'—will find little to hold onto. The sermon functions more as a prophetic 're-orientation' than a practical 'instruction.'",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong example of prophetic, visionary preaching that excels in theological conceptualization. It successfully takes the hearer on a journey through the 'beat' of salvation history. However, from a Kolb perspective, it is an incomplete learning cycle. It provides the 'What' and the 'Why' with great power, but leaves the 'How' almost entirely to the hearer. For a congregation seeking intellectual and spiritual re-orientation, it is highly effective; for a congregation seeking practical discipleship tools, it requires further development in the pragmatic and active quadrants."
