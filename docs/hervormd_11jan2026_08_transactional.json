    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Parental' preaching. While it offers significant emotional comfort (NP), it creates a psychological trap by defining spiritual maturity as the total abdication of the Adult ego. By framing self-determination as a 'dirty ego,' it risks fostering a culture of dependency and 'Adapted Child' compliance. The sudden shift from 'unconditional acceptance' to 'radical demands' is a textbook psychological switch that can leave listeners feeling perpetually inadequate.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Invite the Adult ego of the listener. Instead of saying 'You shouldn't lead,' ask 'How can you use your judgment to align with these values?' Move from 'Must' to 'Can'. Acknowledge the 'Ja, maar' (Yes, but) as a valid Adult process of reality-testing rather than a spiritual failure."
