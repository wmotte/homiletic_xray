    "summary": "This sermon is a rare example of high psychological health in a homiletic context. It systematically dismantles the 'Critical Parent' image of God (the 'Imperialist God') that often keeps believers in a state of 'Adapted Child' fear or 'Victim' passivity. By using Adult-Adult transactions, the preacher empowers the listener to take responsibility within a 'Covenant' (contractual) relationship with the Divine. The shift from individual guilt to systemic analysis prevents the 'NIGYSOB' game. The imagery of the 'Nurturing Parent' (Mother God) provides emotional safety without creating dependency.",

      "The confession section at the end risks briefly pushing the listener back into the 'Victim' role of the Drama Triangle before the absolution.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to frame the 'Covenant' as a voluntary Adult contract. Ensure that the 'we' in the confession allows for individual 'Adult' dissent to maintain authentic autonomy."
