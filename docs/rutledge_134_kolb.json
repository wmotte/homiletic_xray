    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively uses the 'narrative art' of the biblical text to create a concrete experience. It avoids abstract 'everyman' examples in favor of a vivid, cinematic reconstruction of the encounter in the wilderness. The preacher invites the hearer to 'picture a narrow mountainous defile' and describes the sensory details of the caravan (loaves, wine, raisins). However, the experience remains largely historical-narrative; there is less focus on the hearer's immediate, contemporary emotional experience until the very end.",

        "You need to picture a narrow mountainous defile, winding around the rocks so that one party comes upon another quite suddenly.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon pauses to reflect on the human condition and cultural context. It addresses modern 'thought police' and political correctness, asking the hearer to look at the text from different perspectives. It explores the 'why' of David's anger and Nabal's churlishness. However, the reflection often leans toward literary criticism rather than deep existential or psychological probing of the hearer's own life.",

The sermon moves from the specific story to the 'big idea' of God's providence and the foreshadowing of Christ.

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of narrative-visionary preaching that prioritizes theological depth and literary imagination over practical application. It begins by establishing a robust theocentric framework, asserting God's sovereignty as the primary lens for reading Scripture. The preacher then masterfully brings the character of Abigail to life, using vivid imagery and psychological insight to engage the hearer's 'Concrete Experience.' The 'Reflective Observation' phase is handled through a sophisticated critique of modern ideological readings, encouraging the hearer to see the text's timeless human relevance. However, the sermon falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase. While it successfully links the story to the 'Abstract Conceptualization' of Christ's substitutionary work, it fails to provide the hearer with concrete, actionable steps. The concluding 'lessons' are general and lack the specificity needed to facilitate a complete learning cycle for the 'Converging' learner. It is a sermon that enlightens the mind and stirs the heart but leaves the hands without a clear task.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a well-crafted literary and theological exploration that succeeds in moving the hearer through the first three phases of Kolb's cycle. Its strength lies in its ability to rescue a 'minor' character from obscurity and place her within the grand narrative of redemption. The preacher’s refusal to succumb to moralism is commendable, yet this results in a lack of practical 'Active Experimentation.' From a Kolb perspective, the sermon is 'top-heavy'—rich in experience and reflection but light on application. To reach a score of 8 or higher, the preacher must find a way to translate the 'strategy' of the biblical text into the 'strategy' of the believer's life in a way that is as concrete as the raisins and figs Abigail packed for David."
