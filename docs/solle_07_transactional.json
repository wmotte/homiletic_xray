    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically remarkably healthy. It avoids the typical 'Critical Parent' traps of homiletics. Instead of demanding 'Agape' (self-sacrificial love) through guilt, the preacher roots it in 'Eros' (desire and joy), which originates from the Free Child and is processed by the Adult. By integrating these parts, the preacher promotes a holistic, non-fragmented self. The rejection of hierarchy and the move toward 'equality' and 'union' are autonomy-promoting and reduce the likelihood of psychological games.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The idealization of 'geglückte Beziehungen' (successful relationships) might inadvertently leave those in difficult or failed relationships feeling like 'Victims' if not careful.",
      "Slightly intellectualized language might distance the Adult from the immediate emotional experience."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I-messages' as you have done. To ensure no 'Bait & Switch' occurs, ensure that the 'Everything' (Alles) is not turned into a new law, but remains a gift to be discovered."
