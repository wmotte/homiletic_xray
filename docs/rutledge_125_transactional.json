    "summary": "The sermon is intellectually stimulating but psychologically coercive. It utilizes a 'Bait & Switch' tactic, leading the listener through an Adult-level cultural analysis only to trap them in a Critical Parent judgment regarding their 'sinful condition.' By framing intellectual doubt as 'intellectual superiority' (shaming), it discourages authentic Adult processing of faith. The use of a dying woman's fear to validate the 'severity of judgment' is a powerful but manipulative Gimmick (Formula G).",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the 'highbrow' doubts from an Adult-to-Adult position without using sarcasm. Allow the 'Free Child' joy of the resurrection to stand on its own without requiring a 'Critical Parent' shaming of the listener's sin first."
