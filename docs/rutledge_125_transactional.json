    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Bait and Switch' homiletics. It begins with an Adult-level cultural critique but quickly shifts into a Parent-Child dynamic. It effectively uses 'Formula G' by heightening the listener's sense of guilt and inadequacy (the 'Con') through the story of Mrs. McInerney, only to offer the 'Rescuer' payoff of Grace. While theologically orthodox in many traditions, psychologically it fosters dependency by insisting that the listener has no 'intrinsic' life or righteousness.",

      "Reinforcement of the 'Victim' role for the congregation, which can lead to spiritual passivity."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as 'Adults' who can choose to partner with God, rather than 'corpses' who must be acted upon. Reduce the use of 'us vs. them' rhetoric to avoid the 'Ain't It Awful' game."
