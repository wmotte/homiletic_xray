Ontmoetingen die voor een hele belangrijke wending hebben gezorgd in je leven. En ik wil er een persoonlijke ontmoeting met u delen. [...] Jezus wil zo graag Zijn leven ook met jouw tiener delen, en Hij wil ook zo graag dat jij jouw leven met Hem deelt. Jezus nodigt ons uit. Speel dan niet lang een verstoppertje. Blijf niet zitten waar je zit en verroer je niet, maar kom en zie. Amen.",

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a strong concrete experience through a personal anecdote about meeting his wife. This creates immediate identification. However, the transition from the preacher's romantic encounter to the disciples' encounter with Jesus is somewhat abrupt. The sermon attempts to evoke the 'feeling' of being invited, but the sensory details of the biblical scene remain somewhat secondary to the preacher's own story.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Reflection is facilitated through rhetorical questions and a moment of silence. The preacher asks the congregation to consider their own motivations. However, the 'problem' of human resistance or the 'why' behind our hesitation to follow is not deeply explored. The reflection remains mostly at the level of 'what do you want?' rather than a deeper cultural or psychological analysis of why modern people find it hard to 'see'.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The theological core is the 'Lamb of God' (Agnus Dei) and the concept of 'bearing away' sin. The exegesis of the Greek verb for 'taking away' provides some intellectual depth. However, the sermon stays on a well-trodden path of substitutionary atonement without exploring the broader theological implications of the 'Messiah' in the context of John's Gospel. The 'big idea' is clear but lacks a fresh theological angle.",

    "overall_kolb_score": 6.2,
    "summary": "The sermon is a solid example of narrative-driven preaching that successfully integrates personal experience with biblical exposition. It falls short in the depth of its reflective observation; the preacher identifies 'what' is happening (people need to meet Jesus) but spends little time on 'why' the modern hearer might struggle with this, other than general references to sin. The theological section on the 'Lamb of God' is clear and well-grounded in the text, providing a necessary abstract foundation. The pragmatic application is helpful, particularly the use of the Moody illustration to lower the bar for personal witness. However, the movement between the preacher's personal romantic anecdote and the sacrificial work of Christ feels slightly disjointed, as the emotional 'weight' of the two stories is vastly different. The sermon effectively addresses multiple learning styles, with a slight preference for the Accommodating style due to the prominent storytelling.",

    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Strategic advice 1: Spend more time in the 'Reflective Observation' phase by asking 'Why is it so hard for us to leave our 'John the Baptist' (our old securities) today?'",
      "Strategic advice 2: Experiment with a 'Visionary' opening that uses a metaphor rather than a personal story to engage the imagination differently.",
      "Strategic advice 3: Connect the 'Abstract Conceptualization' more directly to the 'Active Experimentation' to avoid a sense of two separate parts."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a functional and engaging piece of homiletic work that scores well on accessibility and narrative flow. From a Kolb perspective, it successfully initiates a learning cycle through concrete experience and moves toward practical application. The primary diagnostic finding is a need for deeper reflection and more imaginative 'visionary' language. While the 'head' and 'heart' are addressed, the 'eyes' of the congregation could be challenged further to see the world and their own resistance through a more critical, wisdom-oriented lens. It is a 'good' sermon (6-7 range) that serves its congregation well but could reach 'excellent' status by deepening its interpretive and visionary tasks."
