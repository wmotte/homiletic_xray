        "The analogy doesn't really work, however, because flowers come up every spring...",

It does not use 'ITHY' (I'm only trying to help you) because it doesn't present the preacher as the source of the solution, but rather points to the 'mystery' of God. It avoids 'NIGYSOB' by not hunting for the congregation's specific sins, but rather addressing the universal 'man of dust' condition."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' By operating primarily from the Adult ego state, the preacher respects the listener's intelligence and agency. He successfully navigates the tension between the Critical Parent (the demands of the Creed) and the Nurturing Parent (the comfort of the Resurrection) without falling into the Drama Triangle. The use of vivid, Free Child imagery (the Guatemalan art) provides an authentic emotional connection that avoids the 'smothering' quality of overly sentimental preaching. The focus on 'bodies' and 'faces' grounds the spiritual message in reality, preventing the 'Ain't It Awful' passivity often found in sermons about the 'evil world.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-Adult engagement with difficult theological concepts.",
      "Avoidance of shaming/coercive language.",
      "Authentic use of Free Child wonder and creativity."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The use of highly tragic imagery (Oklahoma City bombing) can occasionally overwhelm the Adult ego state with Child-level fear.",
      "The transition from 'stupid question' (Paul) to 'sympathetic preacher' could be even more explicit in protecting the listener's Adult."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to acknowledge the 'predicament' of the text; this transparency prevents the 'I Know Best' Parent trap. Maintain the balance of validating human grief (NP) while inviting intellectual reflection (A)."
