  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy because it operates primarily from the Adult ego state. It avoids the typical 'Critical Parent' traps of religious discourse by framing sin not as a list of failures to be punished, but as a lack of awareness (blindness) to be healed. By including 'moral' people in the category of the blind, the preacher levels the playing field and prevents the formation of a 'Persecutor/Victim' dynamic between the 'righteous' and 'unrighteous.' The use of logical analogies encourages the listener to think for themselves rather than simply submit to authority.",
    "strengths": [
      "High Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "Universalizing the 'problem' to avoid shaming individuals.",
      "Clear distinction between external behavior and internal motivation."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'blindness to blindness' section could potentially create a 'double bind' where the listener feels they can never trust their own perception.",
      "More 'Free Child' spontaneity could balance the heavy intellectual/Adult load."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' language to maintain the shared Adult-Adult reality. Ensure that the 'gift' of sight doesn't become a 'Gimmick' where only those who agree with the preacher's specific theology are labeled 'sighted.'"
