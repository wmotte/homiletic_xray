    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively utilizes concrete experiences to ground the theological discussion. It moves beyond abstract 'doubt' to specific, visceral examples: the Alabama tornado, the death of close friends, and the preacher's own struggle at the lectern. The use of sensory details—patent-leather shoes in ruins, the physical act of touching wounds—facilitates emotional connection. However, it occasionally retreats into media analysis (magazines, news stories) which acts as a secondary rather than primary experience for the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "A man looked at the little patent-leather Easter shoes of the children lying in the ruins and said, 'If that don’t shake your faith, nothing will.'",
        "Yesterday afternoon when I was working on this sermon, I received another call; a close friend called to say that her husband... had died in his sleep.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon pauses at the 'why' of the human condition, particularly through the lens of the Alabama tragedy. It explores the tension between faith and doubt as an inherent part of the Easter story. However, the reflection is often quickly funneled into a polemic against the Jesus Seminar or New Age thinking, which can truncate the 'watching and listening' phase before the hearer has fully processed the observation.",
      "quotes": [

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the strongest phase of the sermon. The preacher provides a robust theological framework centered on divine revelation versus human projection. The exegesis of John 20 and 1 Corinthians 15 is logically integrated into a 'big idea': that faith is created by the external Word of God, not an internal voice. The distinction between a 'man-made god' and the 'Creator God' is a clear, dogmatic deepening.",

      "analysis": "The sermon is weakest in providing concrete action steps. While it offers a clear 'invitation to believe' and a 'choice' between two types of gods, it lacks specific ethical calls or 'how-to' steps for the coming week. The application remains largely internal and cognitive—choosing to trust the Word—rather than external or behavioral.",

    "overall_kolb_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of a 'Declarative' structure that successfully integrates 'Visionary' and 'Narrative' elements to address a specific cultural moment. It falls short primarily in the 'Pragmatic' quadrant, offering little in the way of concrete, active experimentation for the hearer. The preacher excels at 'Abstract Conceptualization,' providing a clear and necessary theological distinction between human projection and divine revelation. The 'Concrete Experience' is well-served by the preacher's vulnerability and the inclusion of the Alabama tragedy, which prevents the sermon from becoming a purely academic lecture. However, the heavy focus on the Jesus Seminar—while historically situated—gives the sermon a somewhat defensive, polemical tone that may limit its effectiveness for those seeking practical guidance for daily Christian living. The cycle is completed, but the 'hands' are not as engaged as the 'head' and 'heart'.",
    "strengths_top_5": [
      "Theological clarity regarding the 'externality' of the Word of God.",
      "Effective use of vulnerability and personal narrative to ground abstract doubt.",

      "Incorporate a 'Pragmatic' section: 'This week, when doubt hits, try this specific practice...'",
      "Deepen the 'Narrative' by staying longer within the biblical story before jumping to cultural critique.",
      "Use more 'Priestly Listening' to the specific, mundane needs of the local congregation."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a high-quality theological discourse that effectively addresses the intellectual and emotional challenges of faith in a skeptical age. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'Head and Heart' sermon that leaves the 'Hands' largely idle. It is highly effective for the 'Assimilating' hearer who seeks logical and theological consistency, but it may leave the 'Converging' hearer without a clear path forward. The priority for improvement is the development of the Pragmatic/Active Experimentation quadrant to ensure the theological insights are translated into lived practice."
