    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience through contemporary social narratives and specific historical figures. It avoids abstract 'everyman' examples in favor of visceral stories like Bud Welch's grief and the physical frailty of Pope John Paul II. While the opening is somewhat formal and 'preacherly,' the middle section effectively draws the hearer into Peter's sensory experience—the 'choking' on breakfast and the 'bitter taste' of self-confrontation. However, it lacks a singular, immersive 'slice of life' that sustains the hearer's identification from start to finish, opting instead for a montage of experiences.",
      "quotes": [
        "Peter must have choked on the food; the words of Gerard Manley Hopkins in one of his sonnets describe it perfectly.... God's most deep decree Bitter would have me taste: my taste was me.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher pauses significantly to explore the 'why' behind human behavior—specifically the nature of betrayal and the 'blue wall of silence.' By comparing Peter's denial to modern-day 'snitching' in police departments and schools, the preacher forces the hearer to observe the human condition from a psychological and sociological perspective. It avoids premature solutions by dwelling on the 'abysmal shame' Peter must have felt, allowing the problem to breathe before offering the theological answer.",
      "quotes": [
        "We need to stop and think about this. As it happens, a great deal has been written lately about snitching. Betraying a friend is thought to be one of the greatest offenses of all.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The theological exposition is clear but somewhat traditional. The preacher formulates the 'big idea' around the universality of sin ('Who killed Jesus? All of us sinners killed him') and the concept of justification. While the exegesis of the Greek 'more than these' is mentioned, it remains at a surface level. The sermon relies heavily on the 'substitutionary' logic without deeply challenging the hearer's theoretical framework beyond standard dogmatics. The connection between the 'bitter taste' and 'divine life' is poetic but could benefit from sharper logical scaffolding.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. The sermon concludes with a call to 'receive the Sacrament' and a general encouragement to 'go forth as new creatures.' While the examples of the Sisters of Providence provide a model for action, the preacher does not provide the hearer with concrete, 'how-to' steps for their own life. The application remains largely internal and liturgical rather than ethical or practical in the daily life of the parishioner. The 'experimentation' is limited to the immediate response of the heart during the service.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a sophisticated example of 'Assimilating' homiletics that prioritizes cultural analysis and theological reflection over practical application. It falls short in providing concrete ethical handles for the congregation, relying instead on the liturgical act of the Eucharist to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The sermon's greatest strength lies in its 'Reflective Observation,' where it uses contemporary sociological phenomena (the 'blue wall of silence') to illuminate the biblical text. This creates a high level of intellectual and emotional resonance. However, the 'Active Experimentation' phase is underdeveloped; the preacher invites the hearer to a 'transformed life' without defining the specific contours of that transformation in a secular, postmodern context. The theological 'Abstract Conceptualization' is solid but standard, effectively translating Pauline justification into the Johannine narrative of Peter. The sermon is well-balanced for an academic or urban congregation but may leave the 'Converging' learner—who seeks practical utility—feeling that the 'how' of the Christian life remains a mystery.",

    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Strategic advice 1: Develop the 'Pragmatic' quadrant by asking 'What does this look like on a Tuesday morning in a law firm or a school?'",
      "Strategic advice 2: Use a single, sustained 'Concrete Experience' throughout the sermon rather than a series of brief illustrations.",
      "Strategic advice 3: Experiment with a more 'Inductive' structure where the theological 'Big Idea' is discovered by the hearer at the end rather than stated in the middle."
    ],
    "conclusion": "From a Kolb perspective, this sermon is a strong 'half-cycle' that excels in moving the hearer from experience to reflection and then to conceptualization. It is a 'Sage's' sermon—full of wisdom and interpretive depth. However, it stops short of being a 'Coach's' sermon. The priority for improvement is the 'Active Experimentation' phase. To move from a score of 6.5 to an 8, the preacher must bridge the gap between the 'bitter taste' of the self and the 'transformed life' with specific, actionable ethical wisdom that extends beyond the church doors. The diagnosis is a sermon that is intellectually and emotionally satisfying but practically thin."
