  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses two distinct passages but fails to identify what is unique to these specific texts. It treats them as illustrations for general themes of 'music' and 'struggle' rather than extracting a word that can be found 'nowhere else'.",
      "quotes": [
        "These words talk about music; they sing the song of Moses and the song of the Lamb.",
        "The song of Moses is the song of God acting in human affairs... but there's another struggle going on."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Isolate the specific theological link between the Red Sea and the 'sea of glass' in Revelation. Avoid using the text as a springboard for general sociological observations."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Exegesis is largely replaced by imaginative storytelling and modern parallels. There is no evidence of Greek or Hebrew engagement, nor a deep dive into the specific religious history of Israel or the Johannine community.",
      "quotes": [
        "When the economists of Pharaoh began totaling up what they were losing in this free slave labor, they decided they would rather have the afflictions than to lose this free labor."

      "improvement_point": "Replace modern economic projections of Pharaoh with historical-grammatical analysis of the Hebrew 'song' genre and the apocalyptic context of Revelation."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete and contemporary, touching on politics and sociology, which Dekker values. However, it often veers into 'general truths' or political commentary that is not strictly derived from the text's unique voice.",
      "quotes": [
        "What we have going on in the country today is a marriage... an ugly liaison, a 'shacking up' between the political right and the religious right.",
        "Sixty percent of our black children are born now to single-parent families."

      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application flows directly from the 'exposition' of the specific text rather than from general cultural observations."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Exposition and application are mixed, but the 'exposition' is so thin that the 'application' dominates. The hearer is drawn into a narrative, but it is a narrative of the preacher's making more than the text's.",
      "quotes": [
        "And so the armies of Egypt pursued... And so the state senator was complaining in Jefferson parish..."

      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon strongly emphasizes misery (slavery, social decay) and redemption (God's action). It avoids over-objectification by focusing on the 'raw and hurting' human experience.",
      "quotes": [
        "I am talking about the destruction of a race.",
        "It takes the Lord to straighten us out. Takes the Lord to pick us up."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Strengthen the 'gratitude' (sanctification) aspect; the sermon focuses heavily on being 'picked up' but less on the life of service following deliverance."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon addresses 'being lost in time' (social destruction) and the 'power of darkness'. It takes the threat of evil seriously, though it leans more toward collective/temporal loss than eternal choice.",
      "quotes": [
        "The broad way that leads to destruction... I am talking about the destruction of a race.",
        "Evil does not give up easily. It fights on and on."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the 'Lamb' and the victor at Calvary, but the sermon risks a 'moral of the story' approach where Christ is a helper for 'our' struggle rather than the ontological telos.",
      "quotes": [
        "The song of the Lamb... Jesus cried out, 'It is finished.'",
        "He can take hardly anything and make everything out of it. I look back at my life now..."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 19.5 minutes, the sermon barely misses Dekker's 20-minute threshold. It lacks the 'breadth' of theological depth required for true 'depth'.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical breadth to provide more substantive theological 'meat' to support the 20-minute requirement."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s requirements primarily in its lack of specific exegetical rigor and its tendency to use the Bible as a backdrop for sociological and political commentary. While it is concrete and addresses 'misery' with urgency, it fails to provide a word that is unique to the chosen pericopes. The exegesis is replaced by narrative embellishment, and the duration is borderline insufficient for the 'depth' Dekker demands.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application to the zeitgeist and social misery.",
      "Strong sense of the 'struggle' (misery) and the necessity of divine intervention (redemption).",
      "Avoids dry objectivism by engaging with the 'raw' emotions of the congregation."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of original language engagement and historical-theological exegesis.",
      "Substitution of biblical specificity with general political and social anecdotes.",
      "The 'two ways' are framed more as sociological outcomes than as the ultimate destination of the responsible human subject."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an effective speech and a powerful social witness, but according to Dekker’s strict formal definition, it is not yet a 'sermon' because it fails to recreate the specific Bible passage into a current word that can be found nowhere else."
