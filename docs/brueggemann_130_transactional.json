        "score": 8,
        "score_explanation": "The preacher largely avoids moralistic shaming. Instead of 'God will punish you,' the tone is 'The system will crush you.' The 'must' is framed as a functional necessity for freedom rather than a dogmatic threat.",
        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "Coercion is redirected toward the 'Pharaoh' system rather than the listener's identity. The preacher uses the CP voice to critique the status quo, not the congregation.",

      "presence": "High",
      "analysis": "The listener is treated as a thinking subject capable of 'unblinking recognition' and 'intentionality.' The preacher uses sociological and psychological categories to explain theological concepts.",

        "analysis": "The sermon is a call to cease compliance with toxic societal demands (the 'rat-race').",

  "transaction_analysis": {
    "primary_transaction_style": "Adult -> Adult",
    "analysis": "The preacher invites the congregation into a collaborative 'work' of Lent. It is a peer-to-peer call to analyze one's own life and choose a different strategy.",
    "ulterior_motives": "Minimal. The preacher is transparent about the difficulty of the task ('way more dramatic than any of us intends to be').",
    "communicative_purity_score": 9,
    "purity_explanation": "The sermon lacks the typical 'bait and switch' of religious manipulation. It honestly presents the cost of the 'alternative way.'",
    "risk_explanation": "A slight risk of 'Ain't It Awful' regarding the modern world, but it is mitigated by the call to concrete action."

    "preacher_roles": {
      "rescuer": "Low. The preacher points to the 'God of the Exodus' as the liberator, not himself.",

      "victim": "Low. No sense of 'nobody is listening to me' or 'I am suffering for you.'"

    "congregation_position": "The congregation is initially identified as a potential Victim of Pharaoh, but is immediately invited into the role of 'Emancipated Actor.'",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and promotes high levels of autonomy. By de-personalizing the 'Persecutor' into a systemic 'Pharaoh,' the preacher avoids shaming the congregation. The focus on 'strategies' and 'discipline' engages the Adult ego, while the rejection of 'anxiety' and 'fear' speaks to the healing of the Child ego. It avoids religious 'games' by being honest about the difficulty of the Christian life.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "Empowers the listener with concrete 'strategies' rather than vague guilt.",
      "Accurately identifies the 'Adapted Child' response to modern productivity culture."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Could incorporate more 'Free Child' imagery to make the 'new life' feel more attractive and less like a different set of 'disciplines.'",
      "Slightly academic tone may keep the Adult ego too detached from the emotional reality of the Child."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to frame commandments as 'boundaries for freedom' rather than 'tests for approval.' This keeps the transaction Adult-Adult and prevents the listener from slipping into a 'Rebellious Child' or 'Compliant Child' stance."
