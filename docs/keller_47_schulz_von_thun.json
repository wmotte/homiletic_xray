    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates strong exegetical control, particularly in the harmonization of Mark 14 and John 21. The 'Sache' (the living Christ) is presented through the lens of historical reliability, utilizing Richard Bauckham’s criteria of 'shame and honor' cultures to argue for the authenticity of Peter's failure. The theological depth is significant; the preacher avoids a mere moralistic reading by distinguishing between Jesus as a 'moral exemplar' (which crushes) and Jesus as a 'substitute' (which saves). The explanation of the Greek 'poimainō' and the idiom for crucifixion adds scholarly weight without becoming pedantic. However, the 'blue' side occasionally leans heavily on apologetics, which can risk turning the 'living Subject' into an object of historical proof.",
      "quotes": [
        "This story is strong evidence that the Gospels are eyewitness accounts.",
        "Jesus Christ was raised for our justification and raised for our salvation.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher exhibits a 'Compulsive-Schizoid' tendency (Riemann), characterized by a high degree of structural order and intellectual distance, yet softened by 'diaconal' self-revelation. The preacher does not use the pulpit for personal catharsis but uses the 'I' to model the struggle of faith (e.g., admitting the difficulty of belief in the West). The inclusion of the Dick Lucas anecdote serves as a proxy for self-revelation, allowing the preacher to discuss 'pastoral coldness' without making the sermon about his own therapy. The 'green' side is subservient to the text, though a bit more raw personal vulnerability regarding the 'fires' mentioned at the end could have deepened the authenticity.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s almost comical I’m going to try to cover all of those principles so briefly.",
        "I actually believe all Christians... cannot just say, 'Well, I was raised believing that.'",

    },
    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching-Solidary'. The preacher speaks as a fellow traveler in a secular age, acknowledging that 'people are going to question it everywhere.' There is no 'speaking from above' in a moralistic sense; rather, the preacher places himself and the congregation under the same judgment of being 'curved in on themselves.' However, the tone is highly intellectual, which may create 'relationship noise' for those seeking more 'Depressive' (warm/nurturing) closeness. The 'we-definition' is strong: we are all Peters, all failures in need of grace. The appeal to 'do the hard work' of looking at evidence defines the relationship as one of mutual intellectual responsibility.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s supposed to change you and me.",

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest side. The preacher masterfully navigates the tension between 'Zuspruch' (Promise) and 'Anspruch' (Demand). The appeal is not to 'try harder' (which is explicitly condemned as the 'moral exemplar' trap) but to 'submit to the pattern' of death and resurrection. The 'red' force is directional: it moves the listener toward repentance as a form of 'liberating death.' The ratio is heavily weighted toward Gospel; even the demand to 'feed sheep' is presented as a gift of grace resulting from failure. The risk of moralism is low because the preacher insists that effectiveness comes *from* failure, not from avoiding it.",
      "quotes": [
        "If Jesus Christ came as a moral exemplar... he’s a failure.",
        "You have to submit to the pattern.",

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Excellent. The promise of grace is the ontological foundation for the demand of service.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Very low. The sermon explicitly deconstructs moralism.",
      "strengths": [
        "Clear 'directional force' toward the grace of God.",
        "The appeal to 'courage' is rooted in Christ's finished work, not human grit."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The final appeal 'Let Jesus take you to your fires' is slightly vague in its practical execution.",
        "The four-point structure can feel like a 'to-do' list if the listener is in the 'Appeal Ear' mode."

    "disruptions": "The main disruption is the 'intellectualization' of the resurrection, which might chafe against the 'yellow' need for immediate emotional comfort.",
    "healing_disruption": "The 'healing disruption' occurs when the preacher shatters the 'Jesus-as-example' myth, forcing the listener to confront their inability to fulfill their own oaths."

  "reception_simulation": {
    "the_factual_ear_hears": "A well-reasoned defense of the resurrection and a clear dogmatic distinction between substitutionary atonement and moralism.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a sophisticated exercise in Barthian homiletics, where the 'Sache' (Christ) remains the acting subject. The preacher avoids the trap of psychologization by grounding 'experience' in 'justification.' Communicatively, the Schulz von Thun model reveals a preacher who prioritizes the 'Blue' (Factual) and 'Red' (Appeal) sides to build a sturdy theological house. The 'Green' and 'Yellow' sides are present but disciplined, serving the text rather than the atmosphere. The analysis of Peter's failure is psychologically acute, yet it serves a purely theological end: the necessity of grace. The sermon successfully moves from the 'Law' of Peter's oath to the 'Gospel' of Jesus' charcoal fire. While the structure is slightly 'Compulsive' (four points, sub-points), the content is profoundly liberating. The 'Barthian Warning' is heeded; the resurrection is not reduced to a 'feel-good factor' but is maintained as a historical and cosmic reality that 'justifies' the sinner.",
    "barthian_warning": "Minimal psychologization. The preacher explicitly warns against treating the resurrection as a mere 'symbol' or 'feeling.'",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological precision regarding Substitutionary Atonement.",
      "Effective use of historical-cultural context (Bauckham).",
      "Deconstruction of the 'Moral Exemplar' trap."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce the 'Compulsive' four-point structure for a more organic flow.",
      "Increase 'Yellow' warmth in the application phase.",
      "Bridge the gap between 'historical evidence' and 'spiritual encounter' more intuitively."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, intellectually rigorous sermon that maintains communicative integrity by keeping the Gospel promise central."
