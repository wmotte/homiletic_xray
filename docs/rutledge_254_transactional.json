    "psychological_health_score": 7,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically robust, balancing a sharp Critical Parent (moral challenge) with a strong Adult (intellectual rigor) and a vulnerable Child (personal grief). While it flirts with 'Bait & Switch' by using angels to pivot to social commentary, it avoids being truly manipulative by maintaining transparency about the preacher's own position and the objective reality of the biblical text. It promotes autonomy by challenging the listener to move beyond 'therapeutic' religion toward a more complex, reality-based faith.",

      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement with history and art.",
      "Authentic vulnerability regarding personal suffering.",

    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from angelology to Social Service Block Grants is a sharp 'Switch' that may trigger guilt-driven compliance (Adapted Child).",
      "Heavy use of 'dread' and 'terrible' can overwhelm the Free Child's capacity for joy."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To further reduce 'Game' potential, the preacher could invite the congregation to reflect on how they might help the 'widows and orphans' rather than declaring God's judgment on them for the 15% cut, which moves the transaction from Parent-Child to Adult-Adult problem solving."
