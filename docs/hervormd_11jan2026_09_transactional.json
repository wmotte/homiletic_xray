  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Nurturing/Critical Parent' preaching that seeks to stabilize a community under pressure. It uses Adult reasoning to explain difficult terms, which promotes cognitive health. However, it risks creating a 'closed loop' where the Adapted Child is told not to feel shame, potentially suppressing healthy Adult criticism of institutional church failures. The mention of specific sins (e.g., homosexuality) in a list of 'unrighteousness' serves as a Critical Parent boundary-marker that reinforces group identity through exclusion.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult ego in explaining the 'deposit' metaphor.",
      "Empathy for the difficulty of parenting and the fallibility of parents.",
      "Inclusion of self in the need for the Holy Spirit (avoiding the 'I'm OK, You're Not OK' trap)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from acknowledging church scandals to 'not being ashamed' is too abrupt; it may bypass the Adult's need for justice.",
      "The list of sins from 1 Corinthians 6 is delivered as a 'Critical Parent' hammer without Adult context."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward a 10/10 score, the preacher could invite more 'Free Child' spontaneity and ask the congregation more Adult-level reflective questions (e.g., 'How do you personally experience the tension between church failure and Christ's glory?') rather than providing all the answers."
