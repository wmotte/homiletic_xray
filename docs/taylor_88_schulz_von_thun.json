  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon operates on a traditional dogmatic level. It lists historical atonement theories (Legal, Moral, Revelatory) and cites figures like Irenaeus, Anselm, and Grotius. However, the 'Sache' (the living Christ) often gets buried under homiletic tradition and historical anecdotes (Spurgeon, R.W. Dale, Battle of Quebec). The exegesis of 1 Corinthians 15 is thin; the preacher uses the text as a springboard for a thematic meditation rather than a deep dive into the 'fides quae'. For a Barthian, the 'blue' side here is too much about the history of theology and not enough about the radical 'Otherness' of the Word. It informs the listener about what others thought, but the theological depth remains on the surface of systematic categories.",
      "quotes": [
        "There is the legal theory that a law had been violated.",
        "Hugo Grotius, the Dutch theologian, propounded the theory that Calvary meant wiping away an embarrassment...",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as a man deeply rooted in the 'Prince of Preachers' (Spurgeon) tradition. There is a strong sense of 'Selbstdarstellung' as a 'Preacher' with a capital P. However, genuine 'Selbstenthüllung' occurs when he mentions his recent surgery and his childhood tears. This creates a bridge of authenticity. He reveals a soul that is 'surrendered' to his commission. The green side is dominant in the finale, where his personal hope for the afterlife becomes the primary focus. It is a diaconal 'I' insofar as it testifies to faith, but it occasionally flirts with the 'Hysterical' type by centering the preacher's own future celestial entrance.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have just come through a great teaching and testing time... I have passed through surgery.",
        "As a boy I could not read the account of our Lord's death without tears coming to my eyes.",
        "Thank him that he made me a preacher —a preacher down here."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Hysterical/Depressive mix. The 'Hysterical' element seeks the grand stage and the sweeping rhetorical finish ('stately stepping up the broad avenues'). The 'Depressive' element seeks harmony and emotional connection through shared vulnerability regarding illness and childhood.",
      "diaconal_quality": "Mostly subservient, though the rhetorical flourish at the end risks drawing more attention to the preacher's performance than the 'Sache'.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Pastor to Congregation' in a traditional, slightly paternalistic but warm sense. He uses 'my brother' and 'we Christian people', establishing a 'We-definition' of a shared faith community. There is a 'teaching' attitude when explaining the 'Three Days'. However, the relationship is somewhat one-sided; the congregation is the 'audience' to a grand oration rather than a partner in a dialogue. The tone is solidary, especially when discussing suffering and death, which reduces the 'noise' of authority.",

        "Ah, my brother, you have no better word to preach than that third day.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest side, specifically in its 'Zuspruch' (Promise). The appeal is not a moralistic 'do better', but a 'believe this'. The 'Red' side is a call to joy and assurance. The preacher avoids the 'Law' trap by focusing almost entirely on the 'Gift' of the Resurrection. The appeal is to 'know' that Christ lives. This aligns with Immink’s view of the sermon as a performative act where the reality of God is enacted. The ratio of Zuspruch to Anspruch is heavily weighted toward Zuspruch, which is theologically sound for an Easter-themed message.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let every tyrant... know, Christ lives!",
        "I shall say to them, Christ lives!",

        "Powerful focus on the Gospel as a 'Gift'.",
        "Avoidance of moralistic 'shoulds'."

    "dominant_side": "Red (Appeal as Promise)",
    "disruptions": "The transition to the 'Second Day' is a moment of communicative 'noise' where the preacher admits he has 'no warrant' to preach it, yet does so anyway, creating a slight intellectual friction.",
    "healing_disruption": "The disruption of the 'surgery' story serves to ground the high-flying rhetoric in the reality of the 'flesh', which is a 'healing' moment for the listener."

  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Kerygmatic Oratory'. Theologically, it follows the Barthian emphasis on the 'Object' of faith (Christ) rather than human experience, though it uses the preacher's experience as a secondary witness. Psychologically, it is a 'Green-Red' dominant sermon: the preacher's self-revelation as a witness serves the grand appeal of the Gospel promise. While it lacks deep exegetical 'Blue' precision, its communicative integrity is strong because the preacher’s persona is fully aligned with the 'Zuspruch' of the Resurrection. It avoids the 'Compulsive' trap of legalism, opting instead for a 'Hysterical-Depressive' warmth that seeks to move the heart. The 'Barthian Warning' is relevant here: the sermon occasionally risks making the 'Resurrection' a rhetorical climax of human speech rather than letting the Word stand in its own 'Otherness'. However, as a 'diaconal' act of service to the congregation’s hope, it is successful.",
    "barthian_warning": "The preacher risks 'possessing' the Resurrection through rhetorical certainty ('I shall cry... I shall shout'), potentially overshadowing the sovereign act of God with human emotionalism.",
    "top_3_strengths": [

      "Authentic integration of personal suffering.",
      "Clear, rhythmic structure that aids reception."

      "Increase exegetical depth of the 'Blue' side.",
      "Reduce the 'Preacher-Persona' theatricality in the conclusion.",
      "Clarify the 'Second Day' section to avoid theological ambiguity."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A solid, traditional sermon that achieves communicative congruence through passionate personal testimony and a clear focus on the central Christian promise."
