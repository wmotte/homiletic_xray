  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon treats two distinct passages as separate reflections rather than a single unified exposition. While it focuses on the specific wording of the Trinitarian blessing and the 'depths' of the Psalm, it leans toward general biblical themes of love and sin rather than identifying what is unique to these specific verses that cannot be found elsewhere.",
      "quotes": [
        "The one that we read today is the longest, richest, and fullest of all his valedictory blessings.",
        "The depth of which the psalmist is actually speaking here is the depth of the knowledge that he and everyone else is a 'miserable offender.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Isolate the specific 'new, current word' of the pericope. Avoid merging two distinct liturgical dates into one analysis; focus on the singular logic of one text."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is thin. There is a brief mention of Paul's 'agonized' letter to Corinth, but no engagement with the Greek text or the specific theological history of Israel regarding Psalm 130. The preacher relies more on the Book of Common Prayer (liturgical history) than on biblical exegesis.",
      "quotes": [
        "The last four chapters of 2 Corinthians form the most agonized portion of the New Testament.",
        "It is called De Profundis, 'out of the depths.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the original languages and the specific historical context of the Corinthian conflict to ground the 'exposition' in scholarly rigor as Dekker requires."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete in its imagery (addiction, anorexia, the 'gulags'), which Dekker values. However, it occasionally slips into 'general truths' about love and mercy that could apply to any text. The use of the 'zeitgeist' is present in the critique of modern prayer books removing the concept of sin.",
      "quotes": [
        "Maybe he is hooked on drugs and failing in school, maybe she is anorexic and starving herself...",
        "The removal of this line has robbed us of a powerful buttress to the biblical concept of sin..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond psychological analogies (the parent/child) to the concrete 'politics, society, or church' reality of the current congregation."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a pattern of 'illustration then explanation.' While the hearer is drawn in, the exposition of the text often feels like a secondary justification for the initial psychological illustration.",
      "quotes": [
        "Imagine for a moment that you are the parent... This is the position in which the apostle Paul finds himself..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the text itself 'expounds' the hearer, rather than using the hearer's experience to expound the text."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Strong alignment here. The sermon explicitly tackles 'misery' (the depths, miserable offenders) and 'redemption' (plenteous redemption). It avoids being 'too Christocentric' by grounding the Trinity in the relational misery of the human condition.",
      "quotes": [
        "The depth... is the depth of the knowledge that he and everyone else is a 'miserable offender.'",
        "deliverance and new life are to be found in the confession that before God there is something fundamentally... wrong with all of us."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The 'gratitude' part is somewhat underdeveloped; the transition to 'joyous knowledge' is brief compared to the focus on misery."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on the seriousness of being 'lost' and 'self-destruction.' It critiques the modern tendency to ignore the 'miserable' state of man, which aligns with Dekker's 'two ways.' However, the 'eternal loss' is mentioned but not fully realized as a choice.",
      "quotes": [
        "...on the verge of self-destruction.",
        "The less we deserve, the more merit is in his bounty."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'destination of man' more explicit. Address the 'ultimate possibilities of life design' more sharply."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is presented as the source of grace and the incarnation of God's love. The sermon affirms the 'three-personed God,' which implies the two-natures doctrine Dekker demands, but Christ as the 'telos' is sometimes overshadowed by the psychological parent-analogy.",
      "quotes": [
        "God’s love spends itself to the very last drop of the blood of the Son.",
        "the love that has become incarnate in history through Jesus Christ."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure Christ is not just a 'hint' of human love, but the specific 'telos' that detaches man from himself."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The estimated duration is approximately 14-15 minutes. According to Dekker's Thesis 8, a sermon under 20 minutes cannot be a sermon because 'depth needs breadth.'",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical and dogmatic breadth to reach the 20-minute threshold required for substantive depth."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text falls short of Dekker's formal definition primarily due to its insufficient length and the fragmented focus on two separate liturgical occasions. It relies heavily on psychological analogies and liturgical history rather than rigorous linguistic and contextual exegesis. However, it succeeds in addressing the 'misery' of man and the concrete reality of sin, avoiding the 'liberal' trap of making everything safe.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete imagery regarding human misery and social breakdown.",
      "Sharp critique of the modern 'zeitgeist' that seeks to minimize sin.",
      "Clear movement from the 'depths' of human experience to the 'heights' of Trinitarian grace."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (under 20 minutes) prevents the necessary 'breadth' for depth.",
      "Lack of specific Hebrew/Greek exegesis and historical-critical grounding.",
      "The use of two distinct Bible passages weakens the 'specific pericope' requirement."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate homiletical reflection, but it is not yet a 'sermon' by Dekker's strict standards. It lacks the exegetical depth and the formal duration necessary to truly 'recreate' the Bible into a current, proclamatory word."
