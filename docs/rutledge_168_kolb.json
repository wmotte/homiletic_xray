    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively utilizes 'slices of life' to ground abstract theological concepts. The preacher connects the darkness of the tomb to the literal experience of burial and the metaphorical 'deaths' of careers or health. However, the movement into these experiences is often brief before returning to biblical commentary, limiting the depth of identification.",
      "quotes": [
        "Have you buried someone? If you haven’t, you will. You will come to know the cold clasp of death.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength. The preacher pauses significantly at the 'why' of human suffering and the nature of doubt. The sermon resists providing easy answers, instead exploring the tension between the silence of God and the human demand for explanation.

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides solid theological frameworks, particularly regarding the 'theology of the cross' (finding God in wounds). It moves from the concrete to the dogmatic (e.g., the Creed, the nature of Revelation). However, the exegesis is occasionally more descriptive than analytical, summarizing the plot rather than deepening the theological mechanics.",

    "overall_kolb_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of visionary and reflective preaching, particularly suited for the liturgical gravity of the Easter season. It excels in naming the human condition ('night') and interpreting it through a robust theology of the cross. It avoids the pitfall of easy moralism, choosing instead to dwell in the 'ambiguity and pain' of the human experience. However, it falls short of completing the Kolb cycle by failing to provide concrete, active experimentation for the hearer. The 'Active Experimentation' phase is subsumed into the 'Abstract Conceptualization' phase—where 'believing' is treated as the only necessary action. This leaves the 'converging' and 'accommodating' learners with few handles for daily life. The sermon is intellectually and emotionally stimulating but practically thin.",

      "Use more 'Guide/Coach' language to move from 'Who is God' to 'How do we live with this God?'"
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a high-quality liturgical reflection that effectively moves the hearer through the first three phases of Kolb's cycle. Its strength lies in its 'Visionary' and 'Reflective' depth, providing a sober and intellectually honest diagnosis of the human condition in light of the Resurrection. However, its lack of 'Active Experimentation' prevents it from being a truly holistic learning experience. It serves the 'Assimilating' and 'Diverging' learners well but leaves the 'Converging' learner without a clear path forward. The priority for improvement is the development of concrete, ethical, and practical applications that translate the 'Big Idea' into lived reality."
