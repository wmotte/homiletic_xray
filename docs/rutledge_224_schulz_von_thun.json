    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The 'Sache' is the Pauline doctrine of the simul iustus et peccator, framed through the metaphor of the two wolves. The preacher correctly identifies the anthropological tension in Romans 7. However, the exegetical depth is sacrificed for the sake of the eight-minute limit. The transition from the Cherokee legend to the Pauline 'law of sin' is smooth but risks a moralistic misunderstanding where the 'wolves' are seen as psychological states rather than theological realities. The 'blue' side remains largely functional: it provides a framework for the human predicament but skims over the complex transition between Romans 7 and 8. The theological content is orthodox but leans heavily on the illustrative power of the 'Crash' movie and the legend rather than a deep dive into the Greek 'nomos'.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a high degree of urgency and self-awareness. By quoting Whitefield ('as a dying man to dying men'), the preacher signals a rejection of professional distance. There is a palpable sense of pastoral weight. The preacher does not exempt themselves from the 'wretched man' diagnosis, though the 'I' is used more as a rhetorical device for the human condition than as a personal confession of specific sins. The tone is sober, almost somber, reflecting a deep concern for the spiritual state of the listeners. The preacher reveals a worldview that is skeptical of human progress and 'fatuous slogans,' showing a Barthian distrust of liberal optimism.",
      "quotes": [
        "I preached as one never to preach again …, as a dying man to dying men.",
        "Why is the service of God only one thing among many things in your life?",
        "We have no power of ourselves to help ourselves."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Schizoid blend. The preacher seeks structural correctness and dogmatic clarity (Compulsive) but maintains a certain 'dying man' distance that avoids 'depressive' harmony-seeking (Schizoid).",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is diaconal; it serves the gravity of the message rather than seeking personal admiration.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined by a 'teaching' authority. The preacher speaks 'to' the congregation with a series of sharp, interrogative 'Why' questions. This creates a 'paternalistic' distance. While the preacher uses 'we' and 'us,' the rhetorical structure often places the listener in the position of the 'neglectful' party. The 'yellow' signal is one of urgent confrontation. In the context of a National Cathedral, this serves as a 'prophetic' stance, but it risks creating 'relationship noise' where the listener feels lectured rather than accompanied. The 'we-definition' is one of shared captivity, which is theologically sound but psychologically heavy.",

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the strongest side of the sermon. The preacher navigates the Law/Gospel (Anspruch/Zuspruch) tension with precision. The 'Appeal' initially seems to be 'feed the good wolf,' but the preacher then performs a brilliant 'theological pivot.' He asks 'Who is going to feed the good wolf?' and concludes that *we cannot*. The appeal thus shifts from a moral demand (Law) to a call for surrender to the Good Shepherd (Gospel). This prevents the sermon from falling into moralism. The final appeal is not 'do better,' but 'behold what has been done for you.' It is a classic Barthian move: the human 'No' is swallowed by the Divine 'Yes'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The wolf that will win is the wolf that is fed.",
        "Who is going to feed the good wolf? Are you?",
        "We cannot deliver ourselves... we have been delivered by the self-offering of the Good Shepherd."

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Excellent. The demand is shown to be impossible, making the promise (Zuspruch) the only viable resolution.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Low. The preacher explicitly deconstructs the moralistic interpretation of the wolf legend.",

    "disruptions": "The main disruption is the '8-minute' constraint, which forces a density that might overwhelm the listener's 'Factual Ear'.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7,
    "summary": "This is a robust, theologically disciplined sermon that excels in its refusal to offer easy moralistic exits. By using the 'Two Wolves' legend as a foil, the preacher effectively highlights the 'Law' (our inability) before pivoting to the 'Gospel' (Christ's provision). Psychologically, the sermon operates on a high-pressure 'Yellow' side (Relational) to break down the listener's ego-defenses, which is a common homiletical strategy in the tradition of Whitefield and Barth. The 'Green' side (Self-revelation) is characterized by a 'dying man' urgency that lends the sermon authority but perhaps lacks the 'Depressive' warmth that some congregants need to feel safe. Theologically, it avoids the trap of psychologization by making Christ the 'Acting Subject' (Immink) who feeds the sheep, rather than making 'feeding the wolf' a human psychological task. It is a 'Satisfactory-Plus' to 'Good' sermon, limited only by its brevity and its somewhat stern relational posture.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon successfully avoids unhealthy psychologization by explicitly stating 'we have no power of ourselves.' God remains the Subject.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological precision in the Law/Gospel distinction.",
      "Urgent and authentic 'Green' presence.",
      "Effective subversion of cultural moralism."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Relational 'Yellow' side could be less accusatory.",
      "The transition to the Gospel (Romans 8) feels slightly rushed due to time.",
      "Could bridge the gap between the 'Cherokee legend' and 'Christ' with more exegetical connective tissue."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively sharp and theologically sound sermon that prioritizes the 'Promise' over the 'Demand' despite its initial sternness."
