It utilizes the Adult ego state to analyze the 'Critical Parent' tendencies of religious morality and the 'Adapted Child' tendencies of social fear. By framing Providence as a 'playful' and 'generous' reality, it promotes autonomy and the 'I'm OK, You're OK' life position through the lens of mercy.",
