    "summary": "This sermon fragment is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It avoids the common 'Critical Parent' traps of religious discourse. Instead of using the Passion narrative to induce guilt (NIGYSOB) or fear (Adapted Child), the preacher uses an Adult-Adult transaction to explore the psychological and moral implications of non-violence and integrity. The listener is treated as a peer capable of reflection.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to address the congregation as autonomous Adults. To deepen the impact without entering a game, ask open-ended questions that allow the listener's Adult to apply the 'moral integrity' concept to their own 'here-and-now' reality."
