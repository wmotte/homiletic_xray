    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "While theologically rich and poetically expressed, the sermon relies heavily on a Parent-Child dynamic that infantilizes the listener. By insisting that 'there is no health in us,' it potentially bypasses the Adult ego's capacity for healthy self-assessment and growth, replacing it with a 'miserable offender' identity that requires constant external validation (Rescue). The use of the 'desperate parent' metaphor for God is emotionally evocative but reinforces a 'Victim' position for the believer.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as 'Adults' who are capable of choosing the good, rather than 'self-destructive children.' Balance the 'no health' doctrine with the Adult reality of human agency and the 'Free Child's' inherent worth as a creation of God."
