    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. While it begins with an Adult-level exploration of human value, it quickly descends into a Parent-Child dynamic fueled by 'Ain't It Awful' and existential terror. By painting the world as an 'ugly doomed' disorder, it strips the listener of Adult agency, pushing them into an Adapted Child state of fear. The 'Rescuer' payoff provides temporary relief but reinforces a dependency on external religious safety rather than internal spiritual growth.",

      "Over-reliance on 'Scare Tactics' (nuclear war, flames) to bypass Adult reasoning.",
      "Reduction of the world to a 'nervous disorder,' which discourages healthy Adult engagement with reality."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Shift from 'Ain't It Awful' to an Adult-Adult dialogue. Instead of telling the congregation they are 'selling out' (Persecutor), ask them to reflect on how they choose to invest their 'infinite value' in the here-and-now. Replace the 'hiding place' (Rescuer) imagery with 'empowerment' imagery that encourages the Free Child's creativity and the Adult's responsibility."
