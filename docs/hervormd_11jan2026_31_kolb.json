    "sermon_start_end": "Gemeente, ik zet boven de preek: ‘Honeymoon’. Drie gedachten voor de preek. Allereerst letten we op de honing voor de bruiloft. In vers 8 en 9 daar staat dat Simson terugkeerde naar het kadaver van de leeuw [...] Maar eenmaal zie ik al uw luister. Als ik in uw hemel kom. Amen.",
    "notes": "The sermon makes extensive use of visual aids (paintings by Rembrandt) and direct interaction with children, creating a narrative-heavy atmosphere."

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience through vivid storytelling and visual aids. The preacher uses the 'Honeymoon' theme as a recognizable hook and identifies strongly with the characters' emotions—the parents' grief and the bride's manipulation. However, it lacks a contemporary 'slice of life' outside the biblical narrative to ground the experience in the hearer's modern daily reality.",

        "Ik heb weer een paar plaatjes voor de kinderen. Nou, dat is dat is de leeuw, en hij gaat er met zijn hand in.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Reflection is present primarily through existential questioning regarding the 'why' of suffering and spiritual decline. The preacher pauses at the human condition of 'falling away' and the mystery of God's providence. It falls short of a deep cultural or psychological analysis, remaining mostly within the theological-narrative framework.",

    },
    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Theological depth is achieved through Christological typology (Samson as a type of Christ). The preacher formulates the 'big idea' around the victory of the 'Lion of Judah'. However, the exegesis is more allegorical than strictly analytical, and logical connections between the text and the dogmatic conclusions are sometimes associative rather than argumentative.",

      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. The sermon remains largely descriptive and visionary. While there are warnings (e.g., about manipulation and choosing partners), there are few concrete action steps for the hearer's coming week. The application is mostly 'internal' (believing/tasting) rather than 'external' (doing).",

    "summary": "The sermon is a narrative-driven exploration of Judges 14 that succeeds in engaging the imagination and emotions of the hearer. It effectively uses visual aids and a central metaphor ('Honeymoon') to create a 'Concrete Experience'. It pauses for 'Reflective Observation' by addressing the modern pain of parents whose children leave the faith. However, the sermon falls short in 'Active Experimentation'. While it points to the 'Abstract Conceptualization' of Christ's victory, it fails to provide the hearer with concrete, practical handles for daily life. The transition from the biblical story to the Christological application is often associative rather than logically argued, which may leave 'Assimilating' learners seeking more depth. It is a strong example of 'Visionary-Narrative' preaching but lacks the 'Pragmatic' balance required for a full learning cycle.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a well-crafted narrative piece that effectively touches the 'heart' and 'eyes' of the congregation. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'Diverging' sermon that excels in inspiration but lacks in implementation. The priority for improvement is the 'Active Experimentation' phase; the preacher should aim to bridge the gap between the 'sweetness of the Gospel' and the 'bitterness of Monday morning' with specific ethical and spiritual exercises. While the Christological typology is comforting, it needs a more robust logical foundation to satisfy the 'Head' (Abstract Conceptualization) as much as it satisfies the 'Heart' (Concrete Experience)."
