      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in sensory imagery by contrasting the 'glorified body' of art with the 'ugly, bald, miserable' reality of death. Rutledge uses concrete, everyday images—face-lifts, plastic bags, satin-lined coffins—to ground the metaphysical mystery of the Resurrection. She follows Paul Scott Wilson's 'show, don't tell' by describing the women at the tomb as performing 'cosmetic surgery for the corpse.' This vividness prevents the sermon from becoming a dry dogmatic lecture. The imagery of the New Yorker cartoon and the 'scythe' provides a sharp, visual entry point into the human condition of wanting 'control.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The glorified body of the Lord emerging with the banner of victory and a blaze of light.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Rutledge practices 'stewardship of language' by avoiding 'Canaanite' jargon. When she uses theological terms like 'Resurrection' or 'Faith,' she re-contextualizes them through the lens of 'powerlessness' and 'gift.' Her word choice is deliberate—using 'pitiless advance of dissolution' instead of just 'getting old.' However, the list of social ills (NRA, prisons, immigration) feels slightly like a catalog, bordering on generalization, though it serves the purpose of showing the 'movement toward death.' The precision in quoting her dying friend ('Everything can be fixed except death') provides a sharp, unvarnished truth that cuts through religious sentimentality.",
      "quotes": [
        "Hoping to gain mastery over the pitiless advance of dissolution.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The section on social issues (NRA, prisons) is broad; more precise linguistic focus on one might be more effective than a list.",
        "The phrase 'sphere of reality' is slightly vague/jargon-heavy compared to the rest of the text.",
        "The parenthetical '(I do it about ten times a day)' is charming but slightly disrupts the precision of the argument."

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a distinct oral cadence, moving between witty anecdotes and solemn proclamations. There is a rhythmic repetition in the 'looking for the living among the dead' refrain. The use of staccato sentences for emphasis ('And then they knew.') creates a dramatic 'happening' in the sense of Immink. The ending builds a liturgical crescendo using scriptural parallelisms and hymn fragments. It avoids 'paper language' by maintaining a conversational yet authoritative tone, though some of the longer quoted articles slightly interrupt the natural flow of the preacher's own voice.",
      "quotes": [
        "He is risen: he is not here.",
        "Death is ugly, bald, miserable, the last Enemy.",

      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of the 'refrain' from Luke 24 to anchor the rhythm.",

        "The long quotation from the Wall Street Journal slows the rhythmic momentum.",
        "The transition into the 'side comment' about New England breaks the cadence.",
        "The middle section on social issues feels more like a list than a rhythmic movement."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Oral language; the text is clearly designed for the ear, with pauses and emphasis built into the syntax."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' that rejects religious kitsch in favor of visceral reality. Rutledge uses imagery not to decorate, but to 'reframe' the human condition of powerlessness. Her precision in naming the 'ugliness' of death creates a stark canvas upon which the 'mystery' of the Resurrection can appear without becoming a cliché. The rhythm is oratorical and engaging, successfully moving from the humor of a New Yorker cartoon to the 'grim grandeur' of the gospel."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by upsetting the equilibrium: the Resurrection was never seen. This creates an immediate 'mystery' and tension. The movement then descends into the 'dead places' of our culture (cosmetic surgery, death industry, social violence), building a sense of 'fury and frustration.' The turning point (peripeteia) occurs with the women at the tomb—realizing they too were looking in the wrong place. The resolution is not a 'happy ending' but a 're-empowering' in the midst of powerlessness. It is a dynamic journey from the 'wrong places' to the 'right direction.'",
      "quotes": [
        "We search the New Testament in vain for a description of the Resurrection itself.",
        "They were looking for the living among the dead, as we all do.",
        "Now they knew they could turn away from death toward the source of the only true and eternal life."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition from the 'death industry' to 'social violence' is a bit of a jump in the narrative arc.",
        "The conclusion, while powerful, becomes slightly more 'static' as it moves into a string of scripture quotes.",
        "The 'psychoanalyst colleague' anecdote feels like a second 'mini-plot' that slightly competes with the main arc."

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. Rutledge 'reframes' (Cilliers) the biblical text through the lens of modern 'control' culture. The connection between the women's spices and modern 'cosmetic surgery for the corpse' is a brilliant aesthetic synthesis. She honors the 'strangeness' of the text by emphasizing that the Resurrection is 'out of our range of understanding.' The context (NRA, Dr. Kevorkian, New York Times) is not just 'pasted on' but used to show the 'movement in the direction of death' that the text critiques. It is a true 'inter-esse' between the ancient Word and the contemporary world.",

        "They were carrying perfumes and spices—cosmetic surgery for the corpse, so to speak.",

        "The 'New England' joke, while funny, is a bit of a 'weak integration' that leans toward local color rather than the core message.",
        "The transition to the Colossians text feels a bit more 'traditional' and less 'surprising' than the Luke integration."

      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing; reality is seen through the lens of 'powerlessness vs. re-empowerment' rather than 'control'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "As an 'open work of art' (Stark), the sermon is a mixed bag. It is open in its insistence on 'mystery' and its refusal to provide 'saccharine words' or easy fixes. It acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (the friend with cancer). However, it becomes 'closed' in its moralizing tone regarding assisted suicide and social issues. The preacher's voice becomes quite prescriptive ('I'm telling my children...'), which might close the space for hearers struggling with those specific complexities. While it invites trust, it occasionally uses a 'coercive schema' regarding how a 'believer' must respond to death.",
      "quotes": [
        "The manner in which the Resurrection occurred remains a mystery.",
        "I'm telling my children that when I am an old lady they had better not come at me with any plastic bag.",
        "Faith in the Resurrection comes to us as a pure gift."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Honors the mystery of God's action (it was 'hidden from our eyes').",
        "Leaves room for the 'powerlessness' of the hearer.",
        "The ending is an invitation to 'trust' rather than a checklist of duties."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The section on assisted suicide is quite 'closed' and leaves little room for the 'polyvalence' of suffering.",
        "The 'Nigerian refugee' example is presented as a moral imperative ('should cause the whole Christian community to rise up') which, while valid, is rhetorically 'closed'.",
        "The distinction between 'appropriate' and 'not the way of the believer' regarding death could be framed more as an invitation to the 'open work' of faith."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly open in its theology of mystery, but closed in its ethical applications."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is expertly crafted, moving from the 'unseen' mystery of the Resurrection to the 'all-too-visible' death-obsession of modern culture. The 'reframing' of the biblical spices as 'cosmetic surgery' is an aesthetic triumph that bridges the horizon of the text and the hearer. While the sermon occasionally closes the space for grace with strong moral prescriptions, its overall arc sustains the tension between the 'ugly' reality of death and the 'transcendent' power of God."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is a masterclass in anti-kitsch. Rutledge explicitly attacks 'saccharine words,' 'euphemisms,' and the 'back-slapping gum-chewing' attitude toward death. She rejects the 'happy ending' of cosmetic surgery and the 'feeling OK' about death. By insisting that death is 'ugly, bald, miserable,' she creates an authentic aesthetic depth. There is no 'sentiment' here, only 'emotion' grounded in the 'grim grandeur' of the gospel. She refuses to 'fix' death with religious platitudes, which is the hallmark of true homiletic aesthetics.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'saccharine words' and 'euphemisms' she critiques in others.",

      "The description of Jesus being 'deeply troubled' at the tomb of Lazarus."

    "recommendation": "Continue to lean into the 'grim grandeur' and avoid the prescriptive 'I'm telling my children' asides to maintain the highest level of authentic depth."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened by the insistence that the Resurrection is a 'pure gift' and 'out of our control.' By removing the burden of 'mastery' and 'taking charge,' Rutledge opens a space for the 're-empowering' work of the Spirit. However, the space is slightly narrowed by the preacher's strong personal stances on social/ethical issues, which can feel like 'moralization' rather than 'grace.' Nevertheless, the central theme—that we cannot 'fix' death but God has 'overcome' it—sustains the vertical dimension of revelation (Thurneysen) while remaining grounded in human 'powerlessness.'",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between the 'already' of the victory and the 'not yet' of the 'ugly' death are well-sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "High respect for mystery; the 'unseen' nature of the Resurrection is the sermon's foundation.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the theology, but moralization occasionally dominates the application.",
    "recommendation": "Frame the ethical responses (suicide, social justice) more as 'signs of the Resurrection life' rather than 'requirements for the believer' to keep the space for grace fully open."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.7,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'Reframing' (Cilliers) and 'Stewardship of Language' (McEntyre). It avoids the trap of religious kitsch by staring directly into the 'ugliness' of death, thereby making the 'mystery' of the Resurrection more than just a seasonal cliché. The preacher uses the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed tradition—focusing on the Word and the 'strangeness' of God's action—while employing modern narrative techniques to engage the hearer's imagination. The synthesis of the 'cosmetic surgery' of the women at the tomb with the modern 'death industry' is a brilliant aesthetic move that makes the ancient text feel immediate and urgent. While the sermon's ethical prescriptions occasionally border on the 'closed,' its fundamental commitment to the 'uncontrollable' nature of grace creates a powerful space for an encounter with the Holy.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Brilliant 'reframing' of biblical spices as modern 'cosmetic surgery' for the corpse.",
      "Total rejection of religious kitsch and saccharine sentimentality.",

      "Experiment with ending on a more 'open' question to invite the hearer further into the mystery.",
      "Use more 'show' and less 'tell' when addressing social justice issues.",
      "Maintain the sharp, unvarnished quotes from 'real life' which are the sermon's aesthetic backbone."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A high-quality sermon that demonstrates how the 'aesthetic turn' does not have to mean 'beautification,' but can mean a deeper, more honest engagement with the 'form' of the Gospel. By refusing to 'fix' death with language, Rutledge allows the 'uncontrollable' beauty of the Resurrection to emerge with authentic power. It is a model of how to preach the 'strangeness' of the Word in a culture of 'control.'"
