  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Parental' homiletics. It effectively uses the Nurturing Parent to provide comfort, but it balances this with a heavy Critical Parent that equates human relational failure with divine wrath. This creates a 'double bind' where the listener is encouraged to hope for heaven while being told they are currently experiencing 'hell' and 'the curse.' The psychological impact is likely a mixture of relief and heightened guilt/anxiety regarding family dynamics.",
    "strengths": [
      "High empathy for the reality of human suffering.",
      "Strong use of Adult data to ground the sermon in liturgical tradition."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on the 'Wrath'/Critical Parent framework to create tension.",
      "The equation of 'Family Conflict' with 'Hell' is a potent 'Gimmick' that can trigger deep-seated AC shame."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation from an Adult-to-Adult position. Instead of labeling their conflicts as 'the wrath of God' (Parental judgment), invite them to observe their conflicts as 'Adults' and explore the 'Hope of Glory' as a present reality they can choose to participate in through agency, rather than just waiting for 'unassisted nature' to be rescued."
