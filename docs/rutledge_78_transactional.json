    "communicative_purity_score": 9,
    "purity_explanation": "10 = Completely transparent. The preacher admits to 'working on a chapter about evil' for a year and failing to find an answer, which is a high-Adult transparency move.",
    "risk_explanation": "The only risk is a slight 'Nurturing Parent' smothering if the promise of 'Beulah' is used to bypass the 'Adult' reality of ongoing pain, but the preacher largely avoids this by referencing Ecclesiastes."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It avoids the common 'Critical Parent' trap of religious discourse. Instead of demanding compliance (Adapted Child), it validates the listener's 'Adult' reality of suffering and 'Free Child' need for identity. By refusing to explain away evil, the preacher avoids the 'ITHY' game and maintains a high level of communicative purity.",
    "strengths": [
      "High Adult transparency regarding the limits of theology.",

      "The transition to the 'Redemption' section could risk a 'Bait & Switch' if not careful, though here it feels like a continuation of the NP promise rather than a demand."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to model 'Adult' vulnerability by admitting what you do not know. This prevents the 'Parent' ego from becoming 'Critical' or 'Smothering'."
