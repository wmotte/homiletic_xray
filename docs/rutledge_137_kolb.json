      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a strong 'hook' into the hearer's life world by discussing family secrets and the universal tendency to hide failure. It effectively facilitates identification with Peter by translating his ancient denial into modern equivalents of broken promises and moral lapses. The emotional weight of 'the look' is emphasized to create a visceral connection.",

      "analysis": "The preacher pauses significantly at the human condition, asking 'why' the story was preserved.

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of narrative-theological preaching that effectively engages the hearer's imagination and emotions. It begins with a relatable entry point regarding family secrets and shame, successfully drawing the hearer into Peter's experience of denial. The theological work on 'justification' versus 'forgiveness' provides necessary intellectual depth. However, the sermon falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase of Kolb’s cycle. While it provides a beautiful vision of restoration, it offers little in the way of concrete, practical steps for the hearer to implement this 'resurrection life' in their daily relationships or ethical choices. It addresses the 'Diverging' and 'Assimilating' learners well but leaves the 'Converging' learner without a clear application.",

    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Develop a 'Pragmatic' section that occupies at least 20% of the sermon time.",

      "Experiment with a more 'Converging' structure (e.g., 'Three ways to strengthen your brethren')."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a well-crafted piece of homiletical art that excels in the first three phases of Kolb's cycle. It successfully moves the hearer from the concrete reality of shame to a reflective understanding of self-deception, culminating in a clear theological conceptualization of justification. Its primary deficiency lies in its pragmatic application; it inspires the heart and informs the mind but fails to fully equip the hands. To move from a 6.5 to an 8.0, the preacher must provide the 'how' to match the 'what' and 'why' of the gospel message. It is an excellent example of 'Visionary' preaching that needs a stronger 'Pragmatic' anchor."
