    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It avoids the common pulpit trap of the Critical Parent demanding submission. Instead, it utilizes the Adult ego state to process the 'severe contradiction' of human existence. By acknowledging the 'unsettling' nature of the theology and the reality of suffering, the preacher validates the listeners' experience without falling into the Drama Triangle. The use of military metaphors is carefully managed to ensure they represent spiritual 'active resistance' rather than Parent-led aggression.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'I don't pretend to have a grasp' stance; it models intellectual honesty and invites the listener to take responsibility for their own faith journey."
