    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. While it offers comfort, it does so by first infantilizing the listener (Adapted Child) and then positioning the preacher as the sole possessor of 'true vision' (Parent). It utilizes the 'I'm Only Trying to Help You' game by presenting a harsh reality and then shaming the listener if they find that reality discouraging, ultimately creating a dependency on the 'Seer' figure rather than fostering Adult resilience.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as 'Adults' who have their own spiritual agency. Instead of 'opening their eyes' for them (Rescuer), provide tools for them to process their own reality and find their own 'fire' without shaming their very real fears."
