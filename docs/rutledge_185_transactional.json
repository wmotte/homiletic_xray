While it speaks beautifully of love, it psychologically binds the listener to a state of 'Adapted Child' dependency. It suggests that human health and self-regard are obstacles to God's grace, creating a 'Bait & Switch' dynamic where the 'Good News' is only accessible through 'Bad News' about the self.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as 'Adults' who can choose virtue, rather than 'Victims' of a primordial catastrophe. Shift from 'You are broken' to 'We are capable of reflection and change.' Avoid the 'Bait & Switch' of offering grace only after enforced self-abasement."
