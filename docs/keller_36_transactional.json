    "psychological_health_score": 7,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically sophisticated, using Adult ego state analysis to expose the 'Games' people play with religion and morality. It identifies the 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' (ITHY) dynamic in human relationships and religion. However, by defining even 'being nice' as a 'vicious' attempt to control, it risks creating a 'Double Bind' where the listener feels every impulse is tainted, potentially inducing a state of 'Learned Helplessness' that only the preacher's Gospel can solve.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'incurvatus se' analysis is extremely heavy on the Critical Parent, potentially crushing the Free Child.",
      "The transition to the 'solution' relies on a dramatic Switch that may feel like a psychological trap."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward a 10/10, provide more space for the 'Free Child' to respond to God's love without first having to accept a totalizing diagnosis of 'wickedness.' Allow for the possibility of authentic human goodness that isn't purely manipulative."
