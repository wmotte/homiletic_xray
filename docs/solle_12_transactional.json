    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is intellectually stimulating (Adult) but psychologically heavy (Critical Parent). It effectively uses the 'Prophetic Game' to induce systemic guilt. While it avoids individualistic moralism, it risks creating a 'learned helplessness' in the listener by painting a picture of total, inescapable idolatry. The shift to a feminine, nurturing God at the end feels slightly disconnected from the preceding 90% of systemic condemnation.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward a 10/10 health score, provide more 'Adult' agency—concrete steps for the listener to exercise autonomy within the system, rather than just feeling 'Ekel' (disgust) or 'Scham' (shame)."
