This story was associated with the season following the Feast of the Epiphany from the earliest centuries of the church. We have already quoted the key verse that identifies the marriage feast [...] The church, however, in its observance of Epiphany, is to take care of its calling: to point to Christ’s glory, and let his glory take care of itself."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon stays close to John 2, but it tends to treat the text as a theological locus for 'Epiphany' rather than a unique word. It identifies the 'hour' and 'glory' as specific Johannine themes, yet it leans heavily on cross-referencing Isaiah and Paul, which risks diluting the specificity of the Cana pericope itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "The story of the wine at the wedding in Cana is unique to the Gospel of John.",
        "There is a different reference that holds a key to John’s narrative. The image of a great feast... is prominent in the Old Testament."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more on the unique dialogue between Jesus and Mary. What is in this specific interaction that can be found nowhere else? Avoid letting the 'Epiphany season' dictate the theme more than the text itself."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates academic competence, referencing Greek terms (semeion, doxa, telos) and scholarly perspectives (Bultmann). The connection to the Near Eastern wedding context and the eschatological expectations of Israel is adequate.",
      "quotes": [
        "Rudolf Bultmann observes that Jesus’ doxa... is in fact twofold",
        "no other feast in the ancient Near East excelled a wedding feast, which could go on for days"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond 'scholarly commentary' style. Dekker requires that exegesis 'sleeps' in the sermon; here it is too much on the surface, making it feel like a lecture."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The application is almost entirely absent. The sermon remains in the realm of 'general truths' about God's generosity and the 'calling of the church' without ever landing in the concrete life of the hearer. There is no mention of the zeitgeist, modern misery, or specific ethical/spiritual situations.",
      "quotes": [
        "Clearly this is meant as an appeal... to listeners throughout the ages and to this day",
        "The church... is to take care of its calling: to point to Christ’s glory"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify a concrete contemporary 'lack of wine' (misery). How does this specific glory manifest in a world of dechristianization or personal despair? Replace 'listeners throughout the ages' with 'you, here, today'."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "There is no interweaving because there is no application. The text is explained, but the hearer is not 'expounded' together with the text. The sermon remains an objective analysis of a biblical story.",
      "quotes": [
        "John’s purpose, as throughout his Gospel, is theological.",
        "There are many directions to go in preaching and teaching this 'sign' at Cana."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Stop talking *about* the text and start speaking *from* the text to the congregation. Use the 'you' more than the 'they' (the disciples/guests)."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Redemption is present as 'prodigal generosity,' but misery is treated as a biblical theme (Isaiah 24) rather than a human reality. Gratitude is absent. The sermon is too 'objective' and 'Christocentric' in a way Dekker warns against; it forgets the human subject.",
      "quotes": [
        "release from the curse that has been 'cast over all peoples'",
        "the Lord will reign on Mount Zion and 'he will manifest his glory'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The 'outcry for lack of wine' must be made psychological and existential. What is the 'misery' of the wedding guests (and the hearer) that only this wine can heal?"
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The sermon is 'safe.' While it mentions that some do not recognize Him, it immediately softens this with a universalist nod to Romans 11. There is no sense of the 'narrow way' or the possibility of being lost.",
      "quotes": [
        "There will always be those who do not recognize him, but they will nevertheless be in his sight and have a part in his eternal plan"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the crisis of faith. If the 'sign' is for 'beholding and believing,' what is the consequence of turning away? Take the hearer's choice seriously."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Strongest point. Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon correctly links the miracle to the Cross (the 'hour') and the divine nature of Jesus. Grace is presented as 'inexhaustible bounty.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The central purpose is... to reveal the glory of Jesus",
        "to point ahead to the hour of glory, that is, the cross."

      "improvement_point": "Ensure that this Christology is not just a 'doctrine of the two natures' but a living encounter for the hearer."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1350 words, the sermon would take about 13-14 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for 'depth.' It feels more like a theological essay than a full sermon.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the application and the 'misery' section to reach at least 20 minutes. Depth requires more than just theological definitions."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "This text functions more as a theological commentary or a lecture on Johannine motifs than a sermon. It fails Dekker's primary requirement of 'application.' While the Christological focus is adequate and the exegesis is grounded in academic tradition, the human subject is entirely missing. There is no contemporary urgency, no confrontation with the zeitgeist, and no concrete address to the congregation's spiritual life.",
    "strengths": [
      "Clear Christological telos linking Cana to the Cross.",
      "Adequate use of original biblical languages and theological concepts (doxa, semeion).",
      "Strong connection between the New Testament sign and Old Testament eschatological promises."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Total lack of concrete, contemporary application.",
      "Insufficient length (approx. 14 minutes) to achieve homiletic depth.",
      "Avoidance of the 'two ways'; the seriousness of being lost is neutralized by vague universalism.",
      "The tone is too objective/academic, failing to 'expound' the hearer."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker’s definition. It is an 'exposition' but lacks the 'application' necessary to be a 'proclamatory word.' It is a bicycle mechanic who has described the wheel perfectly but failed to mount it on the bicycle."
