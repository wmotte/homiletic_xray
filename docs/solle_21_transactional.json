  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust because it avoids the common 'Parent-Child' trap of religious discourse. The preacher’s high level of self-disclosure (Free Child) invites the listener into an authentic encounter with their own reality. While there is a slight tendency toward 'Ain't it Awful' regarding the darkness of God and the world, it is balanced by the call to 'Israel'—the one who struggles and gains a name. It promotes autonomy by insisting that 'the wrestling, we must do ourselves.'",
    "strengths": [
      "High authenticity and vulnerability (Free Child).",
      "Avoidance of moralistic coercion (Critical Parent).",
      "Promotes personal responsibility in faith."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to political 'nurturing' (Soweto, peace) feels slightly like a 'Switch' in the Drama Triangle.",
      "Could benefit from more 'Adult' processing of how to practically 'wrestle' in daily life."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to monitor the 'Ain't it Awful' dynamic; ensure that the shared pain leads to 'Adult' agency rather than just 'Child' melancholy."
