        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "The CP is present only when describing the 'Law' or the reality of sin, but it is directed at the biblical character or the human condition generally, rather than a finger-pointing exercise at the congregation.",

        "presence": "High",
        "analysis": "The Nurturing Parent is strong, focusing on restoration and healing. It encourages autonomy by suggesting the listener 'go to their own fires' with Jesus.",

          "Nothing equips you more for the right kind of leadership than your failure plunged into a sea of my grace.",

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The preacher avoids ITHY (I'm Only Trying To Help You) by emphasizing that the 'help' comes from the Risen Christ, not the preacher's own expertise. He avoids NIGYSOB by including himself and all humanity in the 'failure' of Peter."

  "drama_triangle_analysis": {
    "preacher_roles": {
      "rescuer": "Low. He points to Jesus as the Rescuer, refusing the role himself.",

    "congregation_position": "The congregation is invited into the 'Adult' role of observer and then 'Free Child' recipient of grace.",

  },
  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' By utilizing a strong Adult ego position, the preacher respects the listener's intellectual autonomy. The use of the Nurturing Parent position is balanced, offering comfort without creating dependency. The preacher successfully avoids the Drama Triangle by placing the 'Rescuer' role solely on the figure of Jesus and inviting the listener into a reality-testing Adult state regarding their own failures.",
    "strengths": [
      "High intellectual honesty (Adult ego).",
      "Use of humor and vulnerability to deconstruct the 'Perfect Preacher' persona.",
      "Clear distinction between moralism (Parent) and grace (NP/Adult)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the 'hard work' of belief could be more Adult-specific (providing more resources).",
      "Slightly more 'Free Child' energy could enhance the 'dancing' metaphor."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'surrogate failure' technique (using Peter or personal stories) to address sensitive moral issues; it prevents the listener from moving into a defensive 'Rebellious Child' state."
