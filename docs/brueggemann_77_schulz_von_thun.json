    "sermon_start_end": "Jesus tells his disciples, in our Gospel reading, that they must have a “righteousness” that surpasses any punctilious moralism. And then Jesus intensifies the commandments of Sinai in the Sermon on the Mount to trace the way his followers are to give themselves over to the command of God [...] The adulthood of the gospel toward which we grow is to become truly human, to slough off the indifference, and to be gracious, unflappable, compassionate, to care about justice in the world, to love the world in God’s way of love. That is why we eat and drink here.",
    "notes": "The sermon employs a socio-ethical lens, redefining 'righteousness' as 'true humanity' and 'adulthood'."

  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a clear exegetical framework by linking the Old Testament (Psalm 112, Isaiah 58) with the New Testament (Matthew 5). The 'Sache' is the definition of righteousness not as moralism, but as social-economic justice. The theological depth is found in the reinterpretation of 'perfection' as 'integration/wholeness.' However, the sermon stays largely on a horizontal level. While the 'blue' side is comprehensible, it risks reducing the 'living Christ' (Barth) to a model for human behavior. The exegesis of Isaiah 58 is historically grounded but leans heavily toward a socio-political lecture rather than a dogmatic exploration of God's holiness. The factual content is solid but lacks the 'vertical' dimension of grace that precedes the act.",
      "quotes": [
        "The poetry comes from a time when the Jews are having a big argument about what constitutes authentic worship.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a self-aware, intellectually honest persona. There is a conscious attempt to be non-threatening while remaining firm on the text's demands. The preacher admits to being an outsider ('I do not know any of you') and a fellow-struggler ('I assume you are like me... resisting'). This creates an authentic 'green' signal of humility. However, there is a slight 'Compulsive' tendency in the structured, point-by-point delivery (I, II, III, IV) which suggests a need for order and control over the message's reception. The 'I' is largely diaconal, serving the text, though the preacher’s own socio-political preferences are clearly 'leaking' through the choice of contemporary parallels.",
      "quotes": [
        "I am sensitive to the fact that I do not know any of you and my mandate is not to provoke.",
        "I assume you are like me in front of these texts, knowing and hoping and resisting.",
        "I always wonder about the ads for 'adult movies'..."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Depressive mix. Compulsive in the rigid structural numbering and focus on 'correct' social behavior; Depressive in the desire for harmony and the explicit statement of not wanting to 'provoke'.",
      "diaconal_quality": "High. The preacher uses personal experience to bridge the gap between text and hearer without overshadowing the Word.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Solidary' but slightly 'Teaching' from a distance. By stating 'I do not know any of you,' the preacher creates a protective barrier that prevents a deep relational 'we'. The tone is polite and respectful, yet there is a subtle 'paternalistic' undertone in the definition of 'authentic adulthood.' The preacher defines the congregation as people who might be 'having the wrong conversation.' This creates a 'Yellow' signal of: 'I am the one who re-focuses you.' The relationship noise is low, but the lack of local familiarity makes the connection feel more like a guest lecture than a pastoral encounter.",

        "I suggest that in biblical rhetoric...",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This is the most problematic side. The sermon is heavily weighted toward 'Anspruch' (Demand). The 'Red' side dominates: be generous, be unflappable, be an adult, care for the neighbor. While these are biblical themes, the 'Zuspruch' (Promise/Gift) is thin. The Gospel is presented as a 'notion of being human' rather than the 'event of God's grace'. The appeal to 'be integrated' and 'slough off indifference' puts significant pressure on the listener. In a Barthian sense, the 'Gift' (the meal at the end) feels like an afterthought to fuel the 'Demand' rather than the foundation of it. The risk of moralism is high because the 'righteousness' described is something the human must 'grow toward' rather than something imputed by Christ.",
      "quotes": [
        "God wills and the world needs authentic adults who can take responsibility.",
        "Be more like the God of mercy...",
        "The adulthood of the gospel toward which we grow..."

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Heavily tilted toward Anspruch. The Gospel is framed as a 'summons' more than a 'rescue'.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "High. The listener is left with a checklist of social virtues to achieve 'authentic adulthood'.",
      "strengths": [
        "The appeal is concrete and socially relevant.",
        "Correctly identifies 'indifference' as a modern vice."

    "disruptions": "Incongruence between the radicality of the text (Isaiah 58) and the cautious, almost apologetic relational signals of the preacher.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 5.8,
    "summary": "The sermon is a clear, well-structured, and socially conscious exposition. It succeeds in making ancient texts relevant to contemporary socio-economic realities. However, from a homiletical-psychological perspective, it suffers from an 'Appeal-overload'. The preacher attempts to soften the blow of the 'Red' side (the demand) with a cautious 'Yellow' side (the relationship), but this creates a communicative tension. Theologically, the sermon leans toward a 'fides quae' (doctrine of works/ethics) rather than a 'fides qua' (living trust in God's action). It risks turning the Gospel into a program for human maturity ('adulthood') rather than a proclamation of God's sovereign grace. The Barthian warning is pertinent here: God is described more as a model to imitate than as the Acting Subject who justifies the ungodly. The 'healing disruption' is present but muted by the preacher’s own hesitation to 'provoke'.",
    "barthian_warning": "High psychologization of 'righteousness' into 'human maturity'. God becomes the 'standard' for human adulthood rather than the 'Lord' who creates new life out of nothing.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Excellent contemporary contextualization of 'fasting' and 'righteousness'.",
      "Intellectual clarity and logical progression.",
      "Authentic humility in the preacher's self-revelation."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Increase the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) to balance the heavy ethical 'Anspruch' (Demand).",
      "Reduce the apologetic relational language to allow the Word's authority to stand.",
      "Shift the focus from 'human growth' to 'God's enabling grace'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A satisfactory, ethically sharp sermon that functions well as a call to social responsibility but lacks the theological 'rest' and 'freedom' of the Gospel's promise."
