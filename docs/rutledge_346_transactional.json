    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'theological gaslighting.' It uses Good Friday to systematically dismantle the listener's Adult ego (competence, self-help, agency) and replace it with a compliant Adapted Child state. While theologically 'orthodox' in its focus on grace, it achieves this by inducing a state of psychological helplessness. The 'maturity' of the listener is defined by their willingness to accept a 'Persecutor' (The Law/Wrath) so they can be saved by the 'Rescuer' (The Cross).",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Address the congregation as Adult subjects capable of choosing the good, rather than 'dead' objects. Distinguish between 'selfishness' and 'self-efficacy'. Avoid using 'maturity' as a hook to lure the Adapted Child into a guilt-cycle."
