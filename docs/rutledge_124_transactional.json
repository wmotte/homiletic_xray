  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is intellectually stimulating (Adult) but psychologically heavy (Critical Parent). It effectively deconstructs comfortable myths but replaces them with a high-pressure demand for performance. The use of the 'investment banker' analogy is a clever Adult-to-Adult hook, but the subsequent shift to the 'darkness outside' is a classic Parent-to-Child fear tactic. The ending attempts to move into a Free Child 'joy,' but it feels somewhat forced after the preceding 'wallop.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult engagement with biblical context.",
      "Clear deconstruction of the 'Adapted Child' passivity (the third servant).",
      "Avoids the 'Ain't It Awful' game by demanding personal agency."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "High reliance on Critical Parent 'shoulds' and 'musts'.",
      "The use of shame (via the Mrs. Winston story) to motivate behavior.",
      "Potential to create dependency on the preacher's 'correct' scholarship."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward a 10/10 health score, the preacher could present the 'joy of giving' as a spontaneous Free Child response to grace, rather than a Parent-mandated requirement to avoid judgment. Ask more Adult-Adult questions that allow the congregation to reach the conclusion of generosity themselves without the 'wallop' of the Persecutor role."
