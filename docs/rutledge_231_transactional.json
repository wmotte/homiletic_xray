    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exceptional example of psychologically healthy homiletics. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, inviting the listener into a reality-based faith rather than a regressive, Parent-Child dependency. By defining 'denial' as a theological and psychological hurdle, the preacher promotes autonomy and personal responsibility. He successfully navigates a national tragedy without falling into the 'Ain't It Awful' game, instead highlighting Adult agency and Free Child resilience (humor).",

      "Use of humor (Free Child) to process suffering."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the Andrew Young section relies heavily on external reporting, which briefly shifts the energy from personal Adult reflection to a more 'Nurturing Parent' civic narrative."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to model vulnerability and the 'Adult' processing of scripture. The distinction between 'All things work for good' and 'God works for good' is a vital Adult intervention that prevents the 'Bait & Switch' game common in many pulpits."
