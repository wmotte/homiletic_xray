  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on one specific pericope. It treats the trial of Jesus as a general narrative theme, jumping between John, Matthew, Mark, and Isaiah. It lacks the 'nowhere else' specificity Dekker demands, treating the text as a springboard for sociological categories.",
      "quotes": [
        "Good Friday, Years A, B, and C",
        "He said, 'All who exalt themselves...' (Matt. 23:12)",

      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one specific text (e.g., John 18:33-38) and extract its unique theological claim rather than harmonizing multiple books into a general theme."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of Greek/Hebrew study or engagement with the religious history of Israel. The 'original context' is reduced to a generic power struggle. The preacher imposes modern political categories onto the first-century context without exegetical grounding.",
      "quotes": [
        "He is a stand-in for Caesar and for Roman power.",
        "This is the God who showed up as the emancipator in the slave camps of Egypt."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Analyze the specific legal and theological tension between the Sanhedrin, Pilate, and Jesus' Messianic claim within the historical-critical framework of the chosen pericope."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "While the application is concrete, it borders on 'general truths' of a political nature. It identifies the zeitgeist through the lens of power dynamics (race, gender, money) but risks turning the sermon into a political speech rather than a word from God.",
      "quotes": [
        "He stands in, among us, for white power in its supremacy.",
        "Did he mean that Blacks would be first and whites would be last?",
        "I suppose for us the like mantra, for either party, is 'Lock him up, lock him up.'"

      "improvement_point": "Ground the contemporary application in the specific theological movement of the text rather than applying a pre-set sociological grid to the narrative."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon is well-structured in its movement between the biblical characters and their modern counterparts. However, because the exposition is thin, the interwoveness feels more like a thematic comparison than a text-driven actualization.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus confused the governor. Finally the governor must ask, 'What is truth?'... The governor has lived so long with fake news..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'exposition' side of the movement is deeper so the 'application' feels like a necessary consequence of the Word, not an external addition."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is present as social injustice and the 'mob' mentality. Redemption is hinted at through the 'broken bread.' However, the 'misery' is largely external (the system, the mob) rather than the hearer's own misery before God.",
      "quotes": [
        "The crowd is like a mob . . . boisterous, blood-thirsty, and thoughtless.",
        "It was food unlike that of Pilate... and it tasted to them like new life."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by addressing the hearer's personal lostness and complicity, moving beyond the 'mob' as an external object."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon presents a choice between two 'kingdoms' or ways of being. It takes the decision seriously ('The verdict will not be long in coming'), though it leans heavily toward 'being lost in time' (social/collective) rather than eternal loss.",
      "quotes": [
        "We wait for a verdict this time. Or if you like, we get to decide the verdict.",
        "The verdict will not be long in coming."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Christ is the subject, but He is portrayed primarily as an 'advocate' or 'stand-in' for social causes. The 'two natures' and the ontological necessity of Christ being God are absent. Grace is mentioned but functions as a social alternative to greed.",
      "quotes": [
        "He was like an advocate for widows, like a guard for orphans, like an attorney for immigrants.",
        "Through Christ as the goal of the sermon, man is ultimately detached from himself... [Dekker Criterion]"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address Christ not just as a moral example or social advocate, but as the Savior who is 'God with us,' providing a salvation man cannot achieve through social reform."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1,100 words, the sermon would last roughly 11 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for theological depth.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical and dogmatic sections to reach at least 20 minutes, allowing the text to breathe and the complexities of the Gospel to be unfolded."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily due to its lack of a specific pericope focus and its brevity. It functions more as a thematic reflection on power and social justice than an exposition of a specific Word of God. The exegesis is replaced by modern sociological categories, and the duration is significantly below the 20-minute threshold for 'depth.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Clear structure using the four players in the drama.",
      "Strong contemporary relevance and concrete language regarding the zeitgeist.",
      "Effective use of the 'two ways' motif through the contrast of Pilate and Jesus."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (11 minutes) prevents theological depth.",
      "Lack of specific biblical focus; uses the Bible as a source for general themes.",
      "Absence of original language engagement or historical-critical depth.",
      "Christology is primarily functional/ethical rather than ontological/soteriological."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is a thematic speech about the gospel and social ethics. It lacks the specific textual grounding, the exegetical rigor, and the necessary length to be considered a 'recreation of the Bible into a new, current, proclamatory word.'"
