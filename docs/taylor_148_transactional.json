        "presence": "High",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Pastoral Nurturing' that borders on psychological regression. It masterfully uses the 'Ain't It Awful' game to build rapport with a frightened audience. While it provides significant emotional validation (NP), it reinforces a 'Victim' stance in the Drama Triangle by emphasizing powerlessness against 'worldwide forces.' The theological payoff is 'rest' and 'waiting,' which, while comforting, may bypass the 'Adult' ego state's need for agency and problem-solving in the face of 1975's realities.",
    "strengths": [
      "High empathy and validation of the listeners' emotional state.",
      "Strong Adult-level analysis of the historical context.",
      "Avoids the Critical Parent 'shame' trap."

      "Over-reliance on the 'Scared Child' ego state.",
      "Lack of 'Adult' application—what can a person actually *do* besides wait?",
      "Potential to foster passivity through the 'Ain't It Awful' game."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Incorporate more 'Adult-to-Adult' transactions. Instead of only promising future rest (NP->AC), ask the congregation how they, as empowered subjects, can 'live in the image of God' (A->A) within their current 'dungeon of lions.'"
