    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon lacks a primary, immersive narrative or a singular 'slice of life' hook. It relies on generalized experiences (breathing, eating) rather than specific, evocative stories that allow for deep emotional identification. While it mentions 'raging cancer' or 'terrorists,' these remain categories rather than lived experiences. The connection to the hearer's world is intellectualized through the lens of the Psalm's imagery rather than felt through a concrete situation.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon is strong in analyzing the human condition, specifically the 'destructive pathologies' of modern autonomy. It pauses to ask why we feel unsafe and identifies the root as a false belief in our own self-sufficiency. It offers a cultural critique of modern science and psychology as attempts to view the world as an autonomous system, effectively exploring the 'problem' of anxiety.",

The 'big idea'—that the Spirit is the life-force of all creation, not just the church—is logically developed and theologically robust. The movement from 'Leviathan' as chaos to 'rubber ducky' is a clear conceptual shift that redefines the hearer's theological framework.",

        "What interests us here is the double use of the same Hebrew term ruah that is rendered as 'breath' in verse 29 and as 'spirit' in verse 30.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of theological reframing, focusing heavily on Abstract Conceptualization and Reflective Observation. It falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase, leaving the practical implications of a 'safe world' largely to the hearer's intuition. The preacher excels as an 'Advocate' and 'Artist,' using memorable metaphors to dismantle the modern myth of autonomy. However, the lack of concrete, specific application (the 'Pragmatic' task) means the learning cycle is not fully closed. The sermon effectively addresses the 'Assimilating' and 'Diverging' learning styles but offers little for the 'Converging' learner who requires practical utility. The exegesis is solid and the cultural critique is sharp, but the movement toward 'public practice' remains an unillustrated ideal.",

      "Develop one 'Pragmatic' point as thoroughly as the 'Declarative' points.",
      "Use a 'Narrative' structure to carry the theological insights through a plot."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a well-crafted theological argument that successfully challenges the hearer's worldview. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'Head-heavy' sermon that provides excellent conceptual tools but lacks the 'Hands' to put them to work. The priority for improvement is the integration of concrete application. While the 'Visionary' and 'Declarative' elements are strong (scoring 7-8), the 'Pragmatic' elements (scoring 3-4) prevent the sermon from being a model of holistic experiential learning. It is an effective piece of 'Prophetic Discernment' that requires more 'Servant Leadership' to help the congregation navigate the transition from insight to action."
