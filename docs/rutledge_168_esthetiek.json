    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes strong, elemental imagery, particularly the dialectic between light and darkness. The preacher effectively 'paints' the scene of the tomb, the linen cloths, and the 'black waters of the river Styx.' There is a successful attempt to ground abstract concepts of death in sensory reality, such as the 'cold clasp' and the 'stench of corruption' (implied through spices). The imagery of the 1994 tornado—specifically the 'little patent-leather Easter shoes'—is a powerful instance of 'showing' rather than 'telling' the devastation of faith. However, some metaphors remain somewhat traditional (light/darkness), preventing a higher score for originality.",
      "quotes": [
        "The dead must cross over the black waters of the river Styx into the kingdom of darkness.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably precise and exhibits high stewardship. The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' while maintaining theological depth. Words are chosen for their weight—'portentously,' 'obliterated,' 'manifestly.' The distinction between 'why' (explanation) and 'who' (revelation) is a masterclass in linguistic precision. The preacher respects the nuances of the text, such as the detail that Thomas likely never touched the wounds, showing a careful handling of the Johannine narrative. The prose is economical; there is little 'fluff,' and each sentence serves the progression of the thought.",
      "quotes": [
        "The kind of doubt that is on view today... is not trendy disaffection.",
        "Ultimately the divine answer does not come in the form of a 'why.' It comes in the form of a 'Who.'",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a dignified, liturgical rhythm. The repetition of 'It was night' creates a somber cadence that mirrors the 'Tenebrae' tradition. There is a clear variation in sentence length—short, punchy sentences ('Death rules there. Satan rules there.') followed by longer, reflective periods. However, the rhythm occasionally feels slightly 'academic' or 'stilted,' particularly in the transitions between biblical commentary and contemporary application. It reads like a well-crafted essay that would require a very skilled orator to prevent it from sounding like 'paper language.'",
      "quotes": [
        "It was night. This is the night in which Sin and Death reign.",
        "Ashes to ashes. Dust we are, and to dust we return.",

        "Effective use of repetition for emphasis (e.g., 'It was night').",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of language in this sermon are characterized by a sober beauty and high precision. The preacher demonstrates excellent stewardship of language, avoiding clichés and religious kitsch in favor of concrete, often stark imagery. The use of the 'night' motif provides a strong aesthetic thread. While the rhythm is occasionally more academic than poetic, the clarity of the 'show, don't tell' moments—particularly regarding human suffering—elevates the text. It is a language of 'sober-Reformed' aesthetics that values truth over superficial ornament."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon segments follow a clear 'Lowry-esque' plot: they begin with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' (the darkness of the tomb, the tragedy of the tornado, Job's loss). There is a palpable movement from the 'trouble' of death and doubt toward the 'grace' of the Word. The 'turning point' in each segment is well-timed—the discovery of the linens, Jesus's appearance to Thomas, and God's voice from the whirlwind. The energy is sustained, though the three-part structure (if delivered as one) might feel repetitive in its 'problem-solution' cycle.",
      "quotes": [
        "The realm of darkness appears to be victorious. There is nothing left of the Messiah but the grave.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a major strength. The preacher 'reframes' the biblical text by placing it alongside the 1994 Alabama tornado and the universal experience of 'the cold clasp of death.' The integration is not forced; the tornado story serves as a contemporary 'Thomas moment' that respects the 'strangeness' of God's silence. Cilliers' concept of reframing is evident: the preacher doesn't just explain the text but uses it to look at reality (suffering, death) through a new lens—the lens of a God who is 'really God' and not a 'domesticated pet.'",
      "quotes": [
        "If we don’t like the tornadoes and premature deaths... we can absolve our man-made gods.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The mention of evolutionary science is a bit of a 'drive-by' comment; it could be integrated more deeply or left out.",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is an 'open work' in its treatment of doubt and suffering, refusing to offer 'pious platitudes' or 'cheap solutions.' It acknowledges the 'ambiguity and pain' where faith must stand. However, the conclusions of the segments lean toward a more 'closed' dogmatic finish ('Let our answer be hers,' 'receive the gift'). While liturgically appropriate, it slightly shuts down the 'polyvalence' that the middle of the sermon so carefully built. It moves from the 'open' space of the whirlwind to the 'closed' space of a confession of faith quite quickly.",
      "quotes": [
        "Again and again this brings us back to the place where faith must stand... in the place of ambiguity and pain.",
        "God’s answer is no answer at all.",

        "Leave more room for the 'not yet'—the fact that we still live in the 'night' even after Easter.",
        "Allow the 'Why?' of the tornado victims to linger longer before the 'Who' answer."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A mix; the middle is polyvalent and open, the endings are monovalent and dogmatic."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is robust, moving effectively from the 'upsetting' reality of death and doubt to the 'reframing' power of the Word. The preacher excels at integrating contemporary tragedy with ancient texts without being reductive. The structure follows a clear narrative arc that respects the tensions of the human condition. While the endings are somewhat traditional and 'closed,' the overall movement creates a 'space for grace' by honoring the silence of God and the reality of human pain."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It explicitly attacks 'pious platitudes' and 'domesticated' views of God. By including the raw cries of the tornado victims and acknowledging that God's answer to Job is 'no answer at all,' the preacher avoids the 'happy ending' cliché. There is no 'sentiment' here, only 'emotion' grounded in the 'cold clasp of death.' The refusal to offer 'soothing explanations' is a high aesthetic achievement in the sense of Cilliers' 'anti-kitsch.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None present; the preacher actively deconstructs potential kitsch (e.g., 'man-made gods')."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The man looking at the patent-leather shoes in the ruins.",
      "The description of the 'vain effort to fend off corruption' with spices.",
      "The admission that the resurrection was 'truly inconceivable' to the disciples."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this rigorous honesty; it is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace precisely through the acknowledgement of the 'night.' By sustaining the tension of the 'Why?' and the 'darkness,' the preacher allows the 'Who' of God to appear as a genuine gift rather than a logical conclusion. The sermon respects the mystery of God (the whirlwind) and the mystery of the resurrection (happening 'at night' with no witnesses). It avoids moralization, focusing instead on the 'living Word' that creates faith.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained exceptionally well, especially regarding the 'non-answer' to suffering.",
    "mystery_respected": "High respect for mystery; the preacher emphasizes that the resurrection was 'unthinkable' and 'inconceivable.'",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; there is almost no 'must' in this sermon, only 'receive' and 'believe.'",
    "recommendation": "Continue to resist the urge to 'explain' the mystery, as the 'unexplained' God is where grace finds its space."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon series represents a high-quality example of 'Sober-Reformed' aesthetics. It rejects the 'visual excess' of sentimentalism in favor of a stark, linguistic beauty that centers on the Word. The preacher's greatest aesthetic achievement is the 'reframing' of human tragedy (the tornado, the grave) through the lens of a God who is 'baffling' and 'infuriating' yet present. The imagery is concrete and visceral, and the stewardship of language is exemplary. While the structure occasionally leans toward a traditional 'problem-solution' homiletic, the depth of the 'problem' is so honestly explored that the 'solution' (grace) feels earned rather than forced. It creates a genuine 'space for grace' by refusing to fill the 'night' with false lights.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rigorous avoidance of religious kitsch and pious platitudes.",
      "Masterful integration of contemporary tragedy with biblical narrative.",
      "Precise and evocative use of the 'night/darkness' motif."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The rhythmic flow could be more 'oral' and less 'academic' in places.",
      "The conclusions could remain more 'open' to match the polyvalence of the sermon's body.",
      "More varied sensory imagery beyond light and dark (touch, smell, sound)."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Poetic-Imagistic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (reframing, anti-kitsch) and Thomas Long (preacher as witness to a baffling God).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'mature' hearers who are weary of easy answers and seek a faith that can withstand tragedy.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'open ending' that leaves the congregation in the 'whirlwind' for a moment.",
      "Read the text aloud during drafting to break up 'paper' sentence structures.",
      "Incorporate more 'Inter-esse' (Cilliers)—the space between the 'already' and 'not yet' of the resurrection."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This is an aesthetically strong sermon that honors the 'aesthetic turn' by making form inseparable from content. The 'sober beauty' of the prose serves the 'radicality' of the gospel. It is a model of how to handle the 'trouble' of the human condition without falling into kitsch, thereby opening a wide space for the 'grace' of the resurrected Christ."
