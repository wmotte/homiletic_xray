    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative games. By operating from a strong Adult ego state, the preacher validates the listener's lived experience of failure and entropy without resorting to Critical Parent shaming or Rescuer 'quick fixes.' The use of the Free Child in the introduction creates an authentic connection, while the vulnerability regarding his own aging prevents a hierarchical Parent-Child dynamic. The theological move—shifting from human effort to divine initiative—is presented as a reality-test (Adult) rather than a coercive dogma.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Ain't It Awful' section regarding global news could potentially trigger passivity if not carefully balanced with the final call to hope.",
      "The description of David's impotence is visceral and could be perceived as 'Persecutorial' toward the elderly, though it serves a thematic purpose."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I-statements' when discussing theology and aging. This maintains the Adult-Adult connection and prevents the congregation from slipping into an Adapted Child role of mere compliance."
