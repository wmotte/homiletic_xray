    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and supportive. It avoids the common trap of using the Critical Parent to enforce dogma. Instead, it uses a Nurturing Parent position to create a safe space. While it does emphasize human helplessness (Victim role in TA terms), it does so to offer a 'Rescuer' (Jesus) that is framed as loving rather than demanding. The transition to the Adult ego position occurs when the preacher asks the listeners to reflect on their own lives and relationships.",

      "Consistent Nurturing Parent tone provides emotional stability."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Could engage the Adult ego more by allowing for more 'open questions' without providing the theological answer immediately.",
      "Slight tendency to 'smother' the listener with grace, which can lead to passivity."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To further strengthen Adult-Adult communication, try to present the ethical implications of the text as a choice for the listener to process, rather than a predetermined 'beautiful' outcome of the Holy Spirit."
