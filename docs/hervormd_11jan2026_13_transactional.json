    "summary": "The sermon starts with an inviting, Adult-Adult reflection on how people reach decisions. However, it quickly devolves into a Critical Parent mode that uses guilt and the fear of spiritual isolation to ensure institutional loyalty. By equating church attendance and administrative tasks directly with one's relationship with God ('You shortchange God'), it creates a high-pressure environment for the Adapted Child. The psychological impact is a 'duty-based' faith where joy is a requirement rather than a fruit.",

      "The use of 'Moet je niet willen' is a classic coercive CP phrase that shuts down Adult reflection.",
      "The link between 'burnout' and 'wrong attitude' is psychologically dangerous and lacks Adult reality-testing."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Shift from 'Must' to 'Can'. Instead of threatening isolation for those who don't attend, explore the Adult reasons why people might struggle to attend. Allow 'joy' to be a spontaneous Free Child response rather than a duty to be performed."
