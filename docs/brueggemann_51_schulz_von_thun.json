  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates a strong grasp of the narrative arc of Acts 3 and 4. The 'Sache' is the resurrection of Christ, which is not treated as a dogmatic fossil but as a 'living power.' The exegesis connects the trial (Acts 4) with the healing (Acts 3) effectively. However, the theological depth remains somewhat horizontal; the preacher translates 'resurrection' almost entirely into 'empowerment' and 'alternative medicine.' While this makes the content highly comprehensible for a modern congregation, it risks reducing the ontological reality of the Resurrection to a socio-political metaphor. The 'blue' side is clear but leans heavily toward a functional theology of liberation rather than a complex dogmatic exploration of the 'Author of Life.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The text is about a sick man who is healed, who now is present in public in good health.",
        "Resurrection data signifies that the world is under new management.",
        "The story makes a connection between the biggest faith claim of the New Testament and a concrete neighbor act."

      "strengths": [
        "Excellent narrative flow and structural clarity.",
        "Strong contextualization of the biblical 'courtroom' drama."

        "Clarify the distinction between 'magical faith healing' and 'alternative medicine' more rigorously."
      ],
      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The use of modern metaphors like 'regime change' and 'damage control' makes the ancient text immediately accessible."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a personality that is intellectually sharp and socially conscious. There is a sense of 'prophetic distance'—the preacher stands with the apostles against 'the authorities.' The 'I' is used sparingly but decisively to guide the interpretation ('I take it that...', 'I want you to think...'). There is a controlled passion here; the preacher is not seeking the spotlight for personal catharsis but for the sake of the 'cause.' However, the tone is somewhat cerebral. The 'green' side reveals a preacher who finds security in the 'alternative' identity of the church, perhaps showing a slight 'Schizoid' tendency toward the intellectualization of the encounter to maintain a professional, prophetic distance.",
      "quotes": [
        "I take it that the meaning is, by what power do you preach the resurrection of Jesus.",
        "I do not say these things to you because we believe in some kind of magical 'faith healing'.",
        "I submit that the dangerous alternative medicine... is exactly the kind of alternative medicine we embrace."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Schizoid-Compulsive. The preacher maintains a high level of intellectual control and structural logic. There is little 'depressive' warmth or 'hysterical' emotional display; the focus is on the 'truth' of the alternative system.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is diaconal, serving the interpretation of the text and the mission of the health center, though it lacks a certain 'vulnerability' of faith.",
      "strengths": [
        "High degree of professional authority.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching' and 'Exhorting.' The preacher addresses the congregation as 'we,' creating a sense of solidarity in the 'alternative' camp. However, there is a subtle 'paternalism' in the way the preacher directs the listeners' thoughts ('Now I want you not to miss the connection'). The relationship is defined by a shared opposition to 'the authorities' and 'the status quo.' This creates an 'in-group' versus 'out-group' dynamic. While this builds community identity, it can feel like the preacher is 'recruiting' the listener into a specific ideological framework rather than meeting them in their individual spiritual need.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now I want you to think for a moment...",
        "We have reduced health care to money management...",
        "That is what we sign on for on this day with new resolve."

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The appeal is strong and directional: 'Sign on' to this alternative medicine. The preacher successfully avoids crude moralism by rooting the 'Anspruch' (demand) in the 'Zuspruch' (the power of the resurrection). However, the appeal is heavily weighted toward social action and institutional identity. The 'red' side asks the listener to be 'bold' and 'confrontive' like Peter. There is a risk that the 'Gospel' is presented as a 'new law' of activism. The promise of 'walking and leaping' is presented as the result of the church's 'alternative medicine,' which puts a significant burden of performance on the 'faithful.'",
      "quotes": [
        "It is a very old practice to which we sign on...",
        "We cannot keep from speaking about what we have seen and heard.",

    "disruptions": "There is a slight 'noise' disruption where the preacher's critique of 'money schemes' might clash with the reality that even the 'health center' being celebrated likely requires significant financial management.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a robust, professionally crafted sermon that excels in 'homiletical translation.' The preacher successfully bridges the gap between the 1st-century text and a contemporary medical-social context. Theologically, it follows a Barthian emphasis on the 'regime change' of God's kingdom, though it leans more toward the political theology of the late 20th century. Psychologically, the sermon is a 'Compulsive-Schizoid' masterpiece: it is structured, logical, and maintains a clear boundary between the 'truth' and 'sentimentalism.' However, the 'Yellow' side (Relationship) remains somewhat one-dimensional, treating the congregation as a collective to be mobilized rather than a group of individuals with varying spiritual needs. The 'Red' side (Appeal) is the engine of the sermon, which is appropriate for a celebration/dedication but risks overshadowing the 'Blue' side's potential for deeper mystery. The sermon is 'Ample Satisfactory' because it achieves its goal with precision, but it lacks the 'extraordinary' vulnerability or 'healing disruption' of the Spirit that would move it into the highest scores.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a risk of 'horizontal psychologization' where the Resurrection is reduced to 'human empowerment' and 'hope and energy.' God as the 'Acting Subject' is present, but often mediated through the 'alternative medicine' of the church.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Sharp narrative analysis of Acts.",
      "Effective use of contemporary metaphors.",
      "Clear, directional appeal."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Increase personal vulnerability in the 'Green' side.",
      "Deepen the 'Blue' side beyond functionalism.",
      "Address the 'Yellow' ear with more individual empathy."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, intellectually stimulating sermon that serves the institution well, but could benefit from more 'diaconal' humility and theological 'rest'."
