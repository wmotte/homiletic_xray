    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily as a rhetorical tool to illustrate power dynamics rather than for sensory immersion. While it successfully employs the biblical metaphor of the 'apple of the eye' and the 'burning bush,' the original imagery is somewhat sparse. The 'math' metaphor (calculus, seven and one) serves as a strong conceptual image that organizes the text, but it remains more intellectual than sensory. There is a missed opportunity to 'paint the picture' of the Sadducees' world or the tactile reality of the burning bush. The imagery is effective in its simplicity but lacks the 'cinematic' quality advocated by Paul Scott Wilson.",

        "How could seven be one in heaven? How could one accommodate seven? How could we do that math for the next age?",

    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and demonstrates high stewardship. The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' in favor of sharp, contemporary sociopolitical and psychological terms like 'status quo,' 'power arrangements,' and 'management.' Every word feels intentional, particularly the repetition of 'control' and 'certitude' to diagnose the human condition. The precision in defining resurrection as 'narrative-breaking' rather than mere 'revivification' shows a deep commitment to clarity. This aligns with McEntyre’s 'caring for words' by refusing to let theological terms remain vague or sentimental.",
      "quotes": [
        "They recognized that Jesus, in his subversive way, was a threat to their power arrangements.",
        "Resurrection is not a stabilizing assertion; it is rather a summons to new possibility out beyond all of our management.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "There is a palpable cadence in the sermon, characterized by short, punchy sentences followed by longer, explanatory sweeps. The use of parallelism ('What then of... What then of...') creates a liturgical rhythm that builds tension toward the conclusion. The 'staccato' nature of the opening creates a sense of urgency. However, some sections feel slightly academic, which disrupts the oral 'flow.' It is clearly written for the ear, utilizing repetition as a rhetorical device to hammer home the theme of 'control' versus 'fidelity.'",
      "quotes": [
        "They asked him a trick question. They appeared to probe his wisdom, but in fact they were trying to catch him out.",
        "What then of our old patterns of control? What then of our old categories of explanation? What then if our old math fails?",

        "Effective use of rhetorical questions to drive the rhythm.",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by a sober, intellectual beauty. The language is precise, avoiding kitsch and jargon in favor of a sharp, contemporary vocabulary of power and management. While the imagery is more conceptual than sensory, the 'math' metaphor is highly effective. The rhythm is strong, utilizing parallelism and rhetorical questions to maintain engagement. It is a text that values clarity and 'stewardship of the word' over baroque decoration, fitting a Reformed aesthetic of 'sober beauty'."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' as described by Lowry. It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with the trick question of the Sadducees. The tension is maintained through the exploration of Jesus' 'cagey' answers. The movement from the ancient conflict (Gospel) to the personal plea (Psalm) and finally to the contemporary crisis (Application) creates a sense of progression. The 'turning point' occurs in the transition from the 'old math' of control to the 'new math' of fidelity. However, the energy dips slightly during the detailed exposition of the Psalm before rebounding in the final section.",
      "quotes": [
        "They asked him a trick question.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength of the sermon. The 'reframing' (Cilliers) is masterful: the Sadducees are not just ancient figures but 'Deans' and 'tenured professors'—the institutional elite of any age. The connection between the 'old math' of the 1st century and the 'old categories' of modern economy and healthcare is surprising yet feels organic. The sermon respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the seven brothers) but uses it to shed light on our own desperate attempts to manage the future. It offers a genuine new frame: the future as a 'narrative-breaking' event rather than an extension of the present.",
      "quotes": [
        "“They” are the Sadducees... perhaps the Dean of the Cathedral and a tenured theological professor or two.",
        "We are like these old Sadducees; we would like to imagine that the future will be like the past.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is an 'open work of art' (Stark) in its refusal to offer easy, 'how-to' solutions. It leaves the hearer in the 'dazzled and grateful' space of the mystery. However, the rhetorical style is quite authoritative and declarative, which can sometimes feel 'closed.' The preacher tells the hearer what they are feeling ('The truth is that we are all now at a risk point') rather than inviting them to discover it. While the *content* is about openness and mystery, the *form* is a series of strong assertions. It ends with an invitation to the Table, which is an open liturgical act, but the interpretation of that act is quite defined.",
      "quotes": [
        "For now we need not ask. We need only to be dazzled and grateful.",
        "The future is in the hands of the narrative-breaking God.",
        "We are free enough... to get on with the new life."

        "Avoids moralistic 'three steps to fidelity'.",

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Theologically open (mystery), but rhetorically somewhat monovalent/declarative."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are strong, particularly in the integration of text and context. The sermon moves dynamically from the ancient trick question to a contemporary crisis of control. The 'reframing' of the Sadducees as modern institutional managers is a highlight. While the narrative arc is clear and the conclusion in the liturgy is effective, the rhetorical tone is highly declarative. It successfully avoids a 'closed' moralistic ending, instead pointing toward the 'open' mystery of God's fidelity, though it does so with a very certain and authoritative voice."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a powerful antidote to religious kitsch. It explicitly rejects 'cheap comfort' and 'business as usual.' There are no clichéd happy endings or sentimental stories. Instead, it deals with 'pressure,' 'assault,' and the 'risk point' of existence. It sustains the tension of the 'inscrutable leap' without resolving it through easy piety. The move to the Table is not a sentimental 'sweet Jesus' moment but a radical act of 'broken bread' in a world of 'mastery.' It distinguishes between 'sentiment' and the 'authentic' weight of God's bottomless love.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None present; the sermon actively deconstructs the 'stabilizing assertions' that usually lead to kitsch."

    "authentic_moments": [

      "The admission that our old categories for the church and economy simply do not work anymore."

    "recommendation": "Maintain this rigor; the strength of the sermon lies in its refusal to offer 'kitsch' solutions to 'narrative-breaking' problems."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a textbook example of Cilliers' 'Space for Grace.' It creates space by systematically dismantling the 'patterns of control' and 'meticulous assumptions' that block grace. By declaring the 'irrelevance' of human management in the face of God's future, it opens a 'space of the between'—between the old age and the new. It honors the mystery of the 'narrative-breaking God' and positions the hearer as the 'apple of God's eye'—a position of receiving rather than achieving.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between 'old certitudes' and 'new waves of faithfulness' is sustained until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "Highly respected; the sermon concludes that we 'need not ask' but 'be dazzled.'",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the 'new life' is presented as a gift received at the Table, not a moral burden.",
    "recommendation": "To further open space, the preacher could acknowledge the *fear* of losing control more empathetically, making the 'space' even more inviting for the anxious hearer."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon exhibits a high level of aesthetic quality, particularly in its intellectual precision and its ability to 'reframe' ancient texts for a contemporary audience. It avoids the common pitfalls of religious kitsch and moralism, opting instead for a 'sober-prophetic' aesthetic. The 'math' metaphor is a brilliant structural device that bridges the gap between the Sadducees' trick question and the modern obsession with management and control. While the imagery is more conceptual than sensory, and the rhetorical tone is quite authoritative, the sermon successfully creates a 'space for grace' by pointing toward the narrative-breaking power of God. It is a work that values the 'beauty of the truth'—even when that truth is subversive—over the 'beauty of the form.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the Sadducees as modern institutional managers.",
      "Absolute avoidance of religious kitsch and easy sentimentality.",
      "Strong, rhythmic language that builds a compelling case for God's 'narrative-breaking' future."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase sensory 'showing' to complement the strong conceptual 'telling'.",
      "Soften the declarative tone to allow for more 'polyvalence' and hearer appropriation.",
      "Integrate the Psalm more tightly into the primary narrative arc of the Gospel."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Diagnostic (Sober-Reformed)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Walter Brueggemann (Prophetic imagination/Reframing), Johan Cilliers (Space for Grace/Anti-kitsch).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'seekers of depth' and those disillusioned with institutional clichés; intellectual hearers who value precision and social critique.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more narrative 'cinematic' scene to open the sermon.",
      "Use more 'vulnerable' language to balance the 'authoritative' prophetic voice.",
      "Explore the 'musicality' of silence or pause within the written structure."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust piece of homiletic work. It excels in the 'aesthetic of the word' through precision and stewardship of language. By refusing to 'seal' the sermon with easy answers, it honors the 'open work' of the Spirit. It is a model of how to use rhetoric not for manipulation, but for the 'unmasking' of false certitudes to reveal the 'bottomless' love of God. Its primary achievement is the creation of a 'space for grace' in a culture of control."
