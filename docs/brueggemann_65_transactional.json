    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and remarkably free of common homiletical games. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, providing a realistic analysis of human 'vicious cycles' without resorting to Critical Parent shaming. By framing the Gospel as 'news' rather than 'advice,' the preacher avoids the Rescuer trap and respects the listener's autonomy. The transition from the 'ache' of the Child to the 'assurance' of the Adult creates a stable psychological platform for the listener.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The concept of 'submission' could be further deconstructed to ensure it isn't heard as a call to the Adapted Child.",
      "Slightly more Free Child energy could enhance the 'joyous unburdening' section."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to distinguish between 'advice' (which often triggers the Child) and 'news' (which engages the Adult). Ensure that the 'Nurturing Parent' voice always points toward the listener's future autonomy rather than a permanent dependency on the 'Rescuer' role."
