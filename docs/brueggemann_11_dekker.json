After almost every play, some lineman rises out of the debris, waves his fist and gestures to the crowd in triumph. If it is a sack of the quarterback, we watch an extra big act of self-assertion. [...] New power, new glory, new dominion, new kingdom, world without end."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Exodus 14 as a springboard but quickly dissolves into a general thematic discussion about 'glory'. It fails Dekker's requirement of finding what is in THIS text that is nowhere else. Instead, it imports a modern sports metaphor that dominates the biblical logic.",
      "quotes": [
        "In this Exodus-Passover reading, Yahweh is not unlike these football linemen.",
        "A good source analysis of Exodus 14 distinguishes between P and J."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus on the specific mechanics of the Red Sea deliverance in Exodus 14 rather than using source criticism (P vs J) as a philosophical framework for 'types' of glory."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates academic awareness of source criticism (P and J sources) and Hebrew terms (hesed, emeth), which meets Dekker's requirement for scholarly preparation. However, the exegesis is used to serve a psychological/thematic point rather than letting the text's own historical-theological weight speak.",
      "quotes": [
        "P is the place where Yahweh twice asserts, 'I will get glory over Pharaoh.'",
        "Full of hesed and ‘emeth. Full of fidelity and reliability."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the 'labels' of source criticism to explain the actual religious history of Israel's crisis at the sea."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete in its imagery (football, parenting, caring for the elderly), which aligns with Dekker's demand for 'true truth' being concrete. However, it borders on the 'general truth' of being a 'nice person' or 'connected,' which Dekker warns against.",
      "quotes": [
        "It means less than nothing to sack Pharaoh or Saddam or any other biggie.",
        "The glory to which we are invited in the gospel is of another sort . . . committed, caring, vulnerable, engaged."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the application more to the specific 'misery' of the congregation rather than general moral categories of 'vulnerability'."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is highly interwoven, but perhaps to a fault. The biblical text and the football metaphor are so fused that the 'present of revelation' is obscured by the 'present of the metaphor'. The hearer is drawn into the metaphor more than the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Yahweh’s behavior would be like an NFL lineman rising in triumph... and then hurrying off the field because he must take his beloved three-year-old to the bathroom."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'exposition' of the Word remains the primary driver, so the application feels like a necessity of the text, not just a clever analogy."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on redemption (rescue) and gratitude (the connected life), but the 'misery' is significantly softened. The 'fear' of the Israelites is mentioned but quickly pivoted to a psychological 'connection' model. It lacks the depth of 'misery before God'.",
      "quotes": [
        "In great fear, the Israelites cried out to Yahweh",
        "Yahweh goes to be with these folks, because they are Yahweh’s true, beloved folks."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect. The threat of Pharaoh and the sea is a matter of life and death, not just a lack of 'connection'."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "This is the weakest point. There is no sense of being 'lost' in time or eternity. The choice is presented as a 'new notion of glory' versus a 'football notion,' which feels like a lifestyle preference rather than a matter of ultimate destination.",
      "quotes": [
        "The glory to which we are invited in the gospel is of another sort.",
        "And if the crowd doesn’t like that, that’s too bad."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Introduce the gravity of the 'two ways'. What happens if we choose the 'glory of the crowd'? Dekker insists on the possibility of being lost."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, specifically through the lens of the Incarnation (John 1:14). The sermon correctly identifies that God's glory is found in the 'cross-shaped' vulnerability of Christ. However, it leans toward a 'theology of the cross' as a moral example rather than Christ as the sole source of life outside ourselves.",
      "quotes": [
        "This glory comes cross-shaped, hurt-shaped, driven by vulnerability",
        "We have indeed beheld God’s glory. It is filled with grace and truth."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Emphasize that man has 'no life in himself' (Thesis 7) and must receive it from Christ, rather than just 'imitating' Christ's vulnerability."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "At approximately 950 words, the sermon would last less than 10 minutes. According to Dekker (Thesis 8), this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for 'depth'. It is a meditation or a speech, not a sermon.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the biblical exposition and the theological implications of the 'two ways' to reach at least 20 minutes (approx. 2000 words)."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text functions more as a theological essay or a 'speech about a biblical idea' (glory) than a sermon as defined by Dekker. It fails the length requirement significantly and lacks the existential gravity of the 'two ways'. While it uses exegesis (source criticism), it subordinates the Word to a dominant sports metaphor, risking the 'generalization' Dekker forbids.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete imagery that avoids abstract 'churchy' language.",
      "Clear attempt to link Old Testament (Exodus) and New Testament (John) through a single theological theme.",
      "Strong focus on the character of God (Trinitarian background) as 'connected' and 'faithful'."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (under 10 minutes) precludes necessary depth.",
      "The 'two ways' and the seriousness of being lost are entirely absent.",
      "The specific 'uniqueness' of the Exodus 14 passage is lost in favor of a general discussion on the nature of glory."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the strict sense of Dekker's definition. It is an insightful theological reflection, but it lacks the proclamatory weight, the specific scriptural rootedness, and the temporal breadth required to be the 'right proclamation of the Gospel'."
