    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust, moving from a Nurturing Parent opening to a strong Adult analysis of history and social ethics. It avoids the trap of 'smothering' the listener in piety, instead using the 'Free Child' energy of song and radiance to fuel Adult responsibility. While it uses a 'Bait and Switch' technique, it does so transparently to challenge the 'Adapted Child's' need for safe, conventional religion. The impact is one of empowerment and autonomy rather than dependency.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-Adult engagement with history and politics.",
      "Challenges the 'Adapted Child' (compliance/respectability) in favor of authentic action.",
      "Uses the 'Free Child' (joy/radiance) as a source of resilience."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Bait and Switch' could feel coercive to those seeking genuine grief-support.",
      "The 'Critical Parent' tone regarding the nation's 'arrogance' may trigger defensiveness (Rebellious Child) in some listeners."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To remain game-free, ensure the 'Switch' from comfort to hardship is presented as an invitation to Adult partnership rather than a Parent-driven 'must' that shames the listener's need for peace."
