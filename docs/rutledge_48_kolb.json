      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively utilizes the 2008 financial crisis as a concrete touchstone.

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of narrative-theological preaching that successfully bridges a specific historical crisis (2008) with biblical text. It falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase, as it provides little guidance for ethical or practical living beyond the liturgical act of communion. The analysis of the human condition (Reflective Observation) and the theological synthesis of God's glory (Abstract Conceptualization) are the sermon's greatest strengths. It addresses the 'Assimilating' and 'Diverging' learners well but leaves the 'Converging' learner without a clear path for application. The tone is intellectually engaging and pastorally sensitive, though it remains somewhat detached from the specific daily struggles of the congregation, focusing instead on broader cultural figures like CEOs.",

      "Use more 'Converging' language: 'Here are three ways we can shield others this week...'"
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a well-crafted theological reflection that excels in interpretation and biblical narrative. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'half-cycle' sermon: it brings the hearer to a place of deep insight and vision but stops short of facilitating the transition into new behavior in the world. The priority for improvement is the development of the Pragmatic quadrant—converting the profound 'mercy-shield' theology into concrete, lived-out practices for a congregation facing economic and spiritual tremors."
