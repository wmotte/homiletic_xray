    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust. It utilizes Transactional Analysis principles by addressing the listener's Adult ego to process the reality of internal conflict (Romans 7) while using the Nurturing Parent to provide the security (Predestination) necessary for the Free Child to act. It avoids the common 'Religious Game' of making the listener feel like a 'bad child' for failing to have a 'stronger will.' Instead, it validates the experience of the 'bound will' as a universal human condition, thereby reducing shame and promoting authentic action.",
    "strengths": [
      "High Adult-to-Adult engagement through relatable examples.",
      "Deconstruction of the 'Critical Parent' voice in religion (the 'musts' of self-help).",
      "Use of the Free Child's imagination (Tolkien) to explain complex dogma."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'mustard' analogy, while funny, could be seen as trivializing the deeper 'bondage' for those with severe addictions.",
      "Slight risk of 'Smothering Parent' by presenting predestination as only 'sweet' without addressing the Adult's logical 'Why?' regarding those not chosen."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use self-disclosure of your own 'Adult' processing (e.g., being bored with sermons) to maintain a level playing field with the congregation."
