    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The factual content is dominated by a socio-political hermeneutic. The preacher correctly identifies the historical and theological context of Luke 4/Isaiah 61 but immediately shifts from exegesis to ideological application. The 'Sache' (the living Christ) is presented not as a person but as a principle of partisan liberation. While the logic is consistent within the framework of Liberation Theology, it lacks dogmatic breadth. The distinction between 'universal' and 'particular' promise is the central factual claim. However, the theological depth is sacrificed for socio-economic categories, potentially reducing the Gospel to a sociological phenomenon (Barthian risk).",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a high degree of intellectual conviction and a clear partisan stance. There is little 'involuntary' leakage of personal vulnerability; instead, the 'I' is presented as a mouthpiece for a global movement. The self-revelation is largely controlled and ideological. One senses a certain 'moral superiority' in the critique of the 'Bourgeoisie,' which suggests the preacher identifies with the enlightened critic rather than the 'rich' who are being criticized. The authenticity is tied to political passion rather than spiritual testimony.",
      "quotes": [

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The relationship to the hearer is confrontational and educational. The preacher speaks 'from above'—not necessarily from a clerical height, but from an ideological one. The congregation is addressed as 'we, the rich,' which creates a collective guilt-association. The tone is provocative. There is a significant 'relationship noise' because the preacher accuses the typical listener's perspective of being a 'trick of the Bourgeoisie.' This can lead to immediate defensive reactions (P.O.Z.), as the listener feels judged before being invited.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is almost entirely 'Appell' (Demand). The 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is strictly conditional: it is only available through solidarity and 'Parteilichkeit.' This turns the Gospel into a new Law (Nomism). The directional force is high: the listener must change their political stance, engage in institutional critique, and abandon their 'class-neutral' exegesis. The theological 'Gift' is buried under the 'Task.' While the appeal is ethically grounded, it risks leaving the listener in a state of 'work-righteousness' (Werkgerechtigkeit) regarding political activism.",

        "Nur wenn wir solidarisch mit denen werden... dann gilt sie auch uns.",

    "healing_disruption": "Yes. It disrupts the 'cheap grace' of a middle-class congregation by forcing a global perspective. However, it borders on 'human clumsiness' due to its ideological rigidity."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 5.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a classic example of 'Kerygma as Social Critique.' From a communication psychology perspective, it is highly polarized. It succeeds in creating a 'Healing Disruption' by challenging the Eurocentric, middle-class monopoly on biblical interpretation. However, it fails the 'Barthian Test' by potentially making God a prisoner of the 'Klassenkampf.' The theological 'Zuspruch' is made strictly conditional upon political 'Parteilichkeit,' which psychologically places the hearer under immense pressure. The 'Yellow' side is fraught with potential for rejection due to the polemical vocabulary. While the preacher's intent is diaconal (serving the poor), the execution is 'Compulsive' in its ideological rigor, leaving little room for the 'Self-Acting Subject' of God's grace to reach the 'rich' sinner as a sinner, rather than just as a political entity.",
    "barthian_warning": "High risk of psychologization/sociologization. God is at risk of becoming an 'Object' used to justify a specific political struggle, rather than the 'Acting Subject' who judges and justifies both the poor and the rich.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Uncompromising focus on social justice.",
      "Sharp analysis of 'class-neutral' exegesis.",
      "Strong sense of historical urgency."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Balance the political 'Anspruch' with the unconditional 'Zuspruch' of the Gospel.",
      "Reduce ideological jargon to lower 'Relationship Noise'.",
      "Allow for a more 'Diaconal' self-revelation that includes the preacher's own struggle with wealth."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A sharp, provocative sermon that functions well as a political manifesto but lacks the pastoral and theological balance required for a holistic communication of the Gospel."
