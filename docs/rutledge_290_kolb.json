    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a highly relatable, concrete childhood image (beans in ears) to illustrate the lure of the forbidden. It effectively connects the biblical narrative of Israel's rebellion to the hearer's own experience of failure and 'cowardly inactions.' The use of two specific, modern stories of bereaved mothers provides a strong emotional anchor in the latter half.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength of the sermon. Rutledge pauses significantly to explore the 'why' of human disobedience, utilizing St. Paul and St. Augustine to analyze the human condition. She explores the 'acute dilemma' of the exiles, forcing the hearer to look at the problem of the 'paralysis of the human will' without offering a quick moralistic exit.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a robust theological framework. It traces the 'New Covenant' from Jeremiah through the Gospels and Pauline epistles.

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon provides powerful examples of the New Covenant in action (the two mothers), the 'how-to' for the hearer is primarily limited to 'prayer' and 'receiving mercy.' It emphasizes that this is 'not our own doing,' which is theologically consistent but leaves the 'Active Experimentation' phase feeling more like 'Passive Reception.'",

    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of a 'complete' homiletic cycle that prioritizes theological depth and reflective analysis. It begins with a relatable concrete experience (the 'beans' song) and moves into a sophisticated analysis of human rebellion using Pauline and Augustinian frameworks. The theological core—the 'Abstract Conceptualization' of the New Covenant—is handled with precision, successfully correcting common misunderstandings about the 'easiness' of the New Testament. The sermon's greatest strength lies in its ability to bridge ancient text with modern narrative, particularly through the two stories of forgiveness in the face of racial violence. However, it is slightly imbalanced toward the 'Assimilating' learning style; the 'Active Experimentation' phase is theologically consistent (emphasizing that change is a gift from God) but may leave some hearers desiring more concrete ethical handles beyond the call to prayer and sacrament. The tone is consistently sober and analytical, avoiding sentimentality while achieving deep emotional resonance.",

      "Experiment with a more 'Pragmatic' structure when dealing with ethical texts."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a high-quality homiletical work that successfully navigates the Kolb cycle. It excels in moving the hearer from a simple experience of 'rebellion' to a deep theological understanding of 'grace.' While it leans heavily on the intellectual and reflective quadrants, the inclusion of powerful modern stories ensures that the 'Concrete Experience' is not lost. The priority for improvement would be to further develop the 'Pragmatic' task, helping the congregation bridge the gap between the 'impossible' gift of a new heart and the 'possible' daily steps of Christian discipleship. Overall, it is an effective model of kerygmatic preaching that respects the hearer's intelligence and emotional depth."
