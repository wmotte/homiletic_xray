    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes vivid, culturally grounded imagery that bridges the ancient world of Thyatira with the contemporary African American experience. The preacher effectively 'paints' the scene of the ancient guilds, translating them into the modern concept of labor unions and 'office Christmas parties.' This 'reframing' (Cilliers) allows the congregation to visualize the temptation of prestige. The imagery of the 'powder underneath the steps' provides a visceral, sensory connection to the theme of internal threat and superstition. While the biblical imagery of 'eyes like a flame of fire' is present, the preacher excels more at creating contemporary sociological images (General Motors, US Steel) than purely poetic biblical landscapes. The 'show vs. tell' balance is generally healthy, though the middle section leans heavily into sociological 'telling' regarding Black history.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is characterized by a 'sober-Reformed' precision mixed with the rhetorical flourishes of the Black Church tradition. The preacher is careful to distinguish between biblical fact and conjecture (e.g., the name of Jezebel). However, there is a noticeable shift from precise homiletical exposition to a more conversational, almost polemical tone in the middle section. The use of 'Canaanite language' is minimal, as the preacher favors direct, earthy vocabulary. The precision is highest when discussing the 'ecclesia visibilis' vs. 'invisibilis,' showing a commitment to theological nuance. Yet, the language regarding gender roles ('women enjoy a sensitivity... men lack') lacks modern nuance and relies on generalizations that, while rhetorically sharp, lack precise stewardship of language in an ethical sense (McEntyre).",
      "quotes": [
        "I do not believe that this passage in Revelation refers to any woman in Thyatira actually named Jezebel.",
        "The black church is our General Motors. Did you get that? I'm going to give it to you straight this morning.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a masterful use of rhythm and cadence, particularly in the 'peroration' (the conclusion). The repetition of 'The Lord is coming' and 'Hold fast' creates a liturgical 'flow' (Immink) that moves the text from a lecture to a performance. The preacher uses staccato sentences for emphasis ('It was a labor town. It was a town of labor unions.') and longer, flowing sentences for narrative. The musicality is not merely decorative; it serves the 'dramaturgy of the word,' building tension and then releasing it in the rhythmic repetition of the final appeal. This is clearly 'oral language' designed for the ear, not 'paper language' for the eye.",
      "quotes": [
        "Whatever the trouble, hold fast. Whatever others do, hold fast. Whatever fate you might find all around you, hold fast.",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon's language is a robust blend of historical exposition and rhythmic, oral performance. It excels in creating 'living metaphors' that bridge the gap between 1st-century Asia Minor and 20th-century America. While it occasionally lapses into sociological 'telling' and gendered generalizations, the overall 'stewardship of language' is high. The musicality, especially in the conclusion, transforms the sermon from a document into a 'happening,' utilizing repetition and cadence to sustain the tension between the 'already' and the 'not yet' of Christ's return."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'homiletical plot' (Lowry) that begins with a geographical and historical orientation, moves into the 'complication' of internal church rot, and concludes with a 'resolution' of holding fast. However, the arc is interrupted by a lengthy digression on Black History. While this digression is rhetorically powerful, it creates a 'double climax' that threatens the structural unity. The 'upsetting of the equilibrium' occurs when the preacher identifies the problem as 'internal' rather than 'external.' The movement toward the end is a classic 'ascent' in the Black preaching tradition, shifting from the 'trouble' of Jezebel to the 'grace' of the coming Lord. The energy is sustained, but the path is somewhat circuitous.",
      "quotes": [
        "The paramount problem in Thyatira seems to have been internal.",
        "I'm not interested in whether you like this sermon, frankly, it doesn't make one particle of difference...",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. The preacher 'reframes' (Cilliers) the ancient text through the lens of the African American experience with startling efficacy. The comparison of the Thyatira guilds to modern professional prestige and the 'General Motors' of the Black Church is a brilliant synthesis. It respects the 'strangeness' of the ancient text (the guilds, the meat offered to idols) while making it immediately relevant to a congregation struggling with identity and institutional pride. The sermon does not just 'apply' the text; it allows the text to 'read' the contemporary context, challenging the hearers to reconsider their own 'heroes' and 'guilds.'",
      "quotes": [
        "For better or for worse, the black church is our General Motors.",
        "Many Christians came to feel that their little house church... was a little something off to the side.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward a 'closed' structure. While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (the struggle to belong to the guild vs. the church), the preacher's tone is highly authoritative and prescriptive ('You do not make your own heroes'). The conclusion, while rhetorically 'open' to the mystery of the Second Coming, is dogmatically 'sealed' regarding the fate of the church ('he has nothing to do with this church'). There is little room for the hearer to interpret the 'Jezebel' figure differently; she is a clear-cut warning. The sermon functions more as a 'witness' (Long) and a 'warning' than an 'open work of art' (Stark) that invites multiple entries.",
      "quotes": [
        "I'm not interested in whether you like this sermon, frankly, it doesn't make one particle of difference.",
        "You will never be a great people until you make your own heroes and your own heroines.",

    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon's structure is a dynamic, albeit interrupted, journey. Its strength lies in the creative 'reframing' of the biblical text within the socio-economic reality of the Black Church. While the narrative arc is somewhat fractured by a long historical digression, the preacher successfully builds a sense of 'event' (Immink) through rhythmic repetition and a clear movement from the 'trouble' of internal seduction to the 'grace' of Christ's return. It is a 'closed' work in its authoritative tone, but 'open' in its final eschatological hope."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'cheap comfort' and 'pre-chewed emotions.' Instead, it confronts the 'pain of suffering' and the 'stench' of moral decay (using the crack epidemic as a contemporary marker). The preacher refuses to offer a 'happy ending' for the church at large, warning that God may 'remove the candlesticks.' This 'sober beauty' (Cilliers) is the opposite of kitsch. The emotions evoked—indignation, pride in heritage, and eschatological longing—feel authentic rather than manufactured. The only slight risk of kitsch is the 'Maranatha' conclusion, which could be seen as a 'cliché' ending, but here it is earned through the preceding tension.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The somewhat stereotypical 'sensitivity of women' section borders on sentimental kitsch.",

    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon creates a 'space for grace' by sustaining the tension between the 'already' of the church's failure and the 'not yet' of Christ's return. Cilliers' concept of 'inter-esse' is visible here: the sermon moves between the 'despair' of a church losing its power and the 'hope' of the faithful few. While the middle section is heavily moralistic and identity-focused, the final movement 'opens space' by shifting the focus from human effort ('you must make your own heroes') to divine action ('The Lord is coming'). The 'mystery' of the invisible church is respected, and the 'sober beauty' of the 'hold fast' command allows grace to appear as the power to endure rather than a quick fix.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between secular prestige and sacred identity are sustained throughout the sermon.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of God's judgment (removing the candlesticks) is presented with appropriate gravity.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Moralization prevails in the middle section, but the sermon ultimately resolves in the 'grace' of the Second Coming.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that the 'moral' call to honor Black heroes is more explicitly rooted in 'grace' as the source of that dignity."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of the 'aesthetic turn' within the African American homiletic tradition. It excels in 'reframing' (Cilliers) ancient biblical realities into contemporary sociological and psychological frames. The preacher uses language not as a 'superficial beautification' but as a 'stewardship of truth' (McEntyre), particularly in the sharp, unsentimental critique of the congregation's identity. The aesthetic power is most palpable in the 'musicality' of the conclusion, where the sermon becomes a 'performance' (Immink) of eschatological hope. While the structure is somewhat fragmented by a thematic detour into Black History, the 'form follows the text' (Long) in its movement from specific warning to universal promise. It avoids 'religious kitsch' by refusing to offer cheap solutions to the 'internal rot' of the church, instead pointing to the 'sober beauty' of perseverance. The sermon successfully opens a 'space for grace' by sustaining the tension of the Lenten journey toward the 'Maranatha' of Christ's return.",

    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust 'event' that honors the Reformed emphasis on the Word while embracing the rhetorical beauty of the Black Church tradition. It is not 'beautified writing' but a 'form that is content,' where the very rhythm of the speech communicates the urgency of the message. By avoiding kitsch and sustaining existential tension, the preacher creates a space where the 'holy happens' in the intersection of ancient text and modern context."
