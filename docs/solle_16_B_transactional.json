It relies heavily on the 'Critical Parent' ego state to create a bond of indignation with the listeners. By framing the 'Other' (the Church hierarchy) as purely pathological ('male neuroses', 'system of death'), it prevents Adult reflection and keeps the listeners in a Drama Triangle. The payoff is a feeling of moral purity at the expense of communal reconciliation or personal introspection.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the 'System' not as a monolithic monster, but as a collection of humans. Move from 'Why do YOU want to die?' (Persecutor) to 'How can WE live?' (Adult). Reduce the use of shaming language to allow the congregation to find their own response rather than just adopting your anger."
