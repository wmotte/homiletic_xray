    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, utilizing historical and cultural data to build a case for a theological 'New Thing.' It specifically targets and dismantles the 'Adapted Child' position (the religious ledger of sins vs. deeds) that many congregants carry. By framing the Gospel as 'creation out of nothing,' it bypasses the typical manipulative games of guilt and 'self-improvement' (ITHY). The use of the Port Authority anecdote serves as a powerful Adult-to-Free Child bridge, evoking empathy without descending into smothering Nurturing Parent dynamics.",
    "strengths": [
      "Dismantles the performance-based Adapted Child ego state.",
      "Maintains Adult-to-Adult respect throughout.",
      "Avoids the 'Bait & Switch' of law and grace."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the 'idols of New York' to the 'new thing' could be even more Adult-processed to avoid a slight 'Ain't It Awful' vibe regarding the city."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize the 'unilateral' nature of grace, as this is the most effective way to prevent the congregation from slipping into 'Adapted Child' compliance or 'Victim' roles."
