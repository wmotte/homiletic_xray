    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The 'Sache' is the focus of this discourse. The preacher provides a dense, exegetically informed exploration of 'glory' (kavod/doxa). There is a clear Barthian influence in the insistence on God's aseity and the distinction between God's essence and His manifestation. The theological depth is significant, moving from the Tome of Leo to the Westminster Shorter Catechism. The 'blue' side is handled with academic precision, ensuring the congregation understands that 'glory' is not a human sentiment but a divine attribute. However, the high level of abstraction and the reliance on Latin terms (aseitas) and Greek etymology risks intellectualizing the mystery of the Incarnation, potentially distancing the 'fides qua' (the act of believing) in favor of the 'fides quae' (the content of faith).",
      "quotes": [
        "In the biblical languages, the word for glory is kavod in Hebrew, doxa in Greek.",
        "God shields his essence from us precisely with its manifestation.",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher's 'I' is largely hidden behind the 'We' of the church or the authority of the 'Text'. There is a conscious effort toward 'diaconal' self-revelation—the preacher serves the doctrine. However, what 'leaks' is a certain aristocratic intellectualism and a palpable frustration with modern 'minimalist' or 'sentimental' theology. The preacher reveals themselves as a guardian of orthodoxy. There is little vulnerability; the faith presented is robust and structural rather than personal or struggling. This creates a distance that, while theologically 'safe' in a Barthian sense (avoiding psychologization), may feel cold to a listener seeking a fellow traveler in faith.",
      "quotes": [
        "We need to remember, in proclaiming Jesus, that our gospel makes no earthly sense.",
        "Perhaps the very word glory seems bombastic to some...",
        "I tell you this, brethren: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive (Zwanghaft). The preacher seeks security in correctness, tradition, and structural integrity. There is a strong emphasis on 'immutable' and 'eternal' truths to counter the 'ephemeral' nature of the world.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is subservient to the text, but the persona is more 'Teacher' than 'Witness'.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teacher-to-Student'. The preacher uses the 'We-definition' to include the congregation in a shared liturgical and creedal tradition ('We all...'). However, there is a subtle paternalism in phrases like 'Most of us don’t realize what we are singing'. The preacher positions themselves as the one who corrects the congregation's 'minimalist notions'. While this is done with 'pastoral warmth' (referencing the Heidelberg Catechism), the non-verbal charge is one of authority. The relationship is 'at eye level' only insofar as we are all 'unclean' before God, but the preacher remains the expert guide through the 'burning bush'.",

        "Most of us don’t realize what we are singing when we toss off the familiar hymn...",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily 'directional' toward a change in perception and worship. The preacher demands a 'recommitment' to the concept of glory. Crucially, the sermon succeeds in the 'Zuspruch vs. Anspruch' test: the 'Anspruch' (the demand to glorify God) is rooted in the 'Zuspruch' (the gift of God's glory in Christ). The appeal is not to 'do' more, but to 'behold' more. It is a call to 'enjoy' God. However, there is a risk of 'moralism of the mind'—the demand to think correctly about God. The red side is strong but remains largely in the realm of cognitive/spiritual orientation rather than concrete ethical action.",
      "quotes": [
        "The body of Christ needs to recommit to this concept of the glory of God.",
        "God’s glory needs to be recovered as a preaching theme.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a robust, 'high-church' homiletical exercise that prioritizes the 'Theological Sache' (Barth) over psychological experience. It is a masterclass in the 'Blue' side, providing the congregation with a necessary dogmatic framework for the Epiphany season. The preacher successfully navigates the tension between Law and Gospel by framing the 'glory' of God as a gift that both judges (Isaiah) and saves (Paul). However, the sermon leans heavily toward the 'Compulsive' Riemann type, seeking security in tradition and correct terminology. This creates a 'Yellow' (relational) distance; the preacher speaks as a herald of a distant King rather than a shepherd among the sheep. The 'Appeal' is rightly centered on worship and 'enjoyment', but the path to that enjoyment remains somewhat abstract. It is a 'Satisfactory to Ample' performance that avoids the pitfalls of modern psychologization but risks losing the 'Relationship Ear' of a modern congregation through its intellectual rigor.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon avoids psychologization admirably. God remains the 'Acting Subject'. There is no 'pinning down' of revelation to mere human 'Erlebnis'.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological and exegetical depth.",
      "Clear distinction between human and divine glory.",
      "Strong Christocentric focus (Theology of the Cross)."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Increase relational warmth to balance the intellectual weight.",
      "Translate abstract concepts (aseity, effulgence) into more accessible imagery.",
      "Include more 'diaconal' personal witness to bridge the gap between pulpit and pew."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A theologically superior sermon that requires more 'psychological bridge-building' to be truly transformative for a diverse congregation."
