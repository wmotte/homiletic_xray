It isn't automatic or obvious. Like the people who are present on Maundy Thursday and Good Friday, those who come today tend [...] Tell them even if you stumble over the words, because the Holy Spirit will be in your words. God raised Jesus on the third day. He is alive. He is here with us at this moment. This is the power from on high. May God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit be praised for ever. AMEN."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon identifies a specific tension in Acts 10:40-41 regarding the 'manifestation' of the Risen Lord only to chosen witnesses. It attempts to find a unique angle by linking this 'limited' manifestation to the phenomenon of 'Low Sunday'. However, it frequently drifts into other texts (2 Cor, 1 Cor, Acts 3, Luke 24) which dilutes the specificity of the Acts 10 passage.",
      "quotes": [
        "Not to all the people, but to those who were chosen by God as witnesses. I never particularly thought about those words before... they jumped out at me."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more exclusively on the 'eating and drinking' aspect of Acts 10:41 as the unique mode of post-resurrection fellowship, rather than using it as a springboard for a general theology of the Cross."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is thin. There is no mention of the original Greek or the specific context of Peter's speech to Cornelius (a Gentile). The 'exposition' is more of a thematic reflection than a rigorous historical-theological analysis of the Lucan perspective.",
      "quotes": [
        "This fact is one of several indications in the New Testament that Jesus' risen body... was of a different order from his earthly body."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the significance of Peter speaking these words to a Roman centurion, which provides the necessary 'religious history' Dekker requires."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the 'zeitgeist' of church attendance and the psychological reality of 'Low Sunday'. It addresses the modern preoccupation with 'income tax and renting the beach house' effectively.",
      "quotes": [
        "After all, the real business of the season is the filing of the income tax and the renting of the beach house, isn't it?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the 'church attendance' application to more concrete ethical or social implications of being a 'witness' in the public square."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon avoids the 'lecture then moral' structure. It moves back and forth between the biblical narrative and the congregation's presence in the pews. However, the 'exposition' parts are often replaced by personal anecdotes.",
      "quotes": [
        "I wondered if this might not be relevant to the discrepancy between the numbers of people who have the opportunity to hear the message... and those who actually believe it."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is present as 'bondage to sin' and the 'perishing', but it feels somewhat secondary to the 'specialness' of the congregation. Redemption is clearly outside man (God raised Him). Gratitude is framed as 'telling others', but the psychological depth of misery is under-explored.",
      "quotes": [
        "...we are all in bondage to sin (Romans 3:22-23), but here he does not hesitate to divide humanity into two groups."

      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by exploring why the 'unbelievers' do not see the Risen Lord—is it blindness, hardness of heart, or divine sovereignty?"

      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Stronger than most modern sermons. It explicitly mentions the 'perishing' versus 'being saved' and the 'two groups' of humanity. It takes the hearer seriously as a responsible being.",
      "quotes": [
        "The word of the Cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God."
      ],

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "Christ is the clear telos. The sermon emphasizes that the Resurrection is God's act and that salvation is in 'no other name'. The doctrine of the two natures is implicit in the discussion of the 'different order' of the risen body.",
      "quotes": [
        "Christ is the one ordained by God to be judge of the living and the dead.",
        "There is salvation in no one else."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At roughly 19 minutes (1950 words), it narrowly misses Dekker's 20-minute minimum. While it has some breadth, the reliance on personal anecdotes (the healing story) takes up space that could have been used for deeper exegetical 'breadth'.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section to reach the 20-25 minute mark, providing more 'depth' through 'breadth' of biblical theology."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily in its exegetical rigor and its failure to meet the minimum length for 'depth'. It relies heavily on personal narrative and anecdotal evidence rather than the 'Hebrew and Greek' scholarship Dekker demands. However, it succeeds in maintaining a sharp distinction between the 'two ways' and keeps Christ as the central telos.",
    "strengths": [
      "Clear Christocentric focus with Christ as the judge and savior.",
      "Courageous handling of the 'two ways' (saved vs. perishing) which is often avoided.",
      "Effective contemporary application regarding the 'zeitgeist' of casual Christianity."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient exegesis of the original context of Acts 10.",
      "Duration is slightly below the required threshold for 'depth'.",
      "Over-reliance on personal anecdotes (the healing of the woman) which risks making the preacher, rather than the Word, the focus."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate attempt at a sermon, but it lacks the scholarly 'exposition' required to be a 'recreation of the Bible into a new, current, proclamatory word' in the strict Dekkerian sense. It is more of a 'thematic address' with strong application than a rigorous 'exposition and application' of a specific passage."
