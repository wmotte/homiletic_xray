    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and promotes autonomy. It successfully navigates the tension between human limitation (Child) and divine sovereignty (Parent) by utilizing a strong Adult ego state to mediate the two. By encouraging 'contentious' prayer, the preacher dismantles the 'Adapted Child' syndrome common in religious settings, where listeners feel they must suppress real emotions to please a Critical Parent deity. The transition from 'rest' to 'work' provides a healthy movement from Nurturing Parent comfort to Adult responsibility.",

      "Validation of the listener's right to question and 'demand' from God.",

    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The definition of 'the work' in Point III could be more open-ended to allow the listener's Adult ego to define their own 'neighborly policy'.",
      "Slightly more 'Free Child' imagery could balance the 'stately fugue' of the Adult rhetoric."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' language to maintain the Adult-Adult contract. Ensure that the 'summons away from pride' remains an invitation to reality rather than a descent into shaming (CP)."
