  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 7,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically complex. It successfully utilizes the Adult ego state to bridge racial and class divides, but frequently retreats into a Critical Parent role to shame the affluent congregation. While the 'Parent' voice is used for social justice, it risks triggering 'Adapted Child' guilt rather than 'Adult' responsibility. However, the preacher's self-inclusion in the 'victimizer' category prevents the sermon from becoming a pure game of NIGYSOB.",
    "strengths": [
      "Self-disclosure of the preacher's own ego-state history.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Heavy reliance on 'must' and 'should' language in the middle section.",
      "The rapid switch from 'victimizer' indictment to 'joyful' payoff can feel like a psychological whiplash."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To increase Adult-Adult transactions, ask more open-ended questions that allow the congregation to process their own 'denial' rather than providing the Parent's conclusion for them. Reduce the 'Bait and Switch' by being more transparent about the shift from empathy for others to self-examination."
