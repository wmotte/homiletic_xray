    "sermon_start_end": "Last month, a certain highbrow critic wrote in a certain highbrow journal that the “central myth” of Christianity is “now being discarded.” [...] whatever spiritual dryness or physical death may threaten you, it is no match for the Holy Spirit of God. Submit to him this day, with joy, and know in your heart that the words will sound for you as they did for that other sinner of Bethany so long ago: “Lazarus, come forth.” AMEN.",

  "kolb_phases_analysis": {
    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively establishes concrete experience by utilizing a specific, emotionally resonant narrative from Jay McInerney’s memoir. It avoids abstract 'everyman' scenarios in favor of a detailed account of a dying woman’s fear and her son's anger. This facilitates empathy and identification with the human condition of guilt and mortality. However, it relies heavily on a literary source rather than direct congregational experience, which may create a slight distance for some hearers.",
      "quotes": [
        "She confessed to her son that years before, she had had an extramarital affair with a married man, a close family friend. As she lay dying, she disclosed that she was afraid.",

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher pauses to explore the 'why' behind the woman's fear and the son's anger, analyzing the cultural tension between 'intellectual superiority' and the reality of sin. It resists premature solutions by validating the woman's fear as a legitimate response to the human condition. The sermon effectively explores the problem of 'righteous peace of mind' versus the reality of transgression.",

        "It seemed like poor economy to have to deal with the b—s— of religion most of your life and then be unable to collect some righteous peace of mind at the end.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a clear theological 'big idea': salvation is not based on human merit but on God's nature ('for the sake of my holy name'). The exegesis of Ezekiel is solid, moving from the literal dry bones to the theological concept of the Holy Spirit as the sole source of life. It successfully formulates a biblical truth that challenges both moralism and cheap grace. However, the connection between the Old Testament 'Spirit' and the Johannine 'Spirit' is stated rather than logically developed.",

      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. The sermon concludes with a call to 'submit to him this day' and 'know in your heart,' which remains largely internal and general. There are few concrete action steps or ethical calls regarding how this 'transformation in the present' manifests in daily life. The implementation of the truth is left to the hearer's intuition rather than being facilitated by the preacher.",
      "quotes": [

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of theological and cultural reflection that fails to reach the point of concrete application. It begins by engaging the hearer's 'Concrete Experience' through a sophisticated cultural critique and a poignant literary narrative. This leads into a deep 'Reflective Observation' on the nature of guilt and the human condition. The 'Abstract Conceptualization' is clear and orthodox, providing a solid theological foundation for grace. However, the 'Active Experimentation' phase is notably thin, offering only general calls to 'submit' and 'trust.' The sermon effectively addresses the 'Diverging' and 'Assimilating' learning styles but leaves the 'Converging' and 'Accommodating' learners without specific handles for action. The language is evocative and the exegesis is responsible, but the lack of pragmatic 'servant leadership' (Osmer) limits its transformative potential for the congregation's daily life.",
    "strengths_top_5": [
      "Sophisticated integration of contemporary literature (McInerney) with biblical text",

      "Dedicate the final third of the sermon to specific, lived-out applications of the theological 'big idea.'",

      "Explicitly ask and answer the question: 'What does this look like in our town this Tuesday?'"
    ],
    "conclusion": "From a Kolb perspective, this sermon is a 'half-cycle' success. It excels in taking the hearer through the phases of feeling, watching, and thinking, but it stops before the phase of doing. It is intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant, making it an excellent example of the 'Visionary' and 'Declarative' structures. However, its diagnostic value for a homiletics class would be to demonstrate how a sermon can be biblically and culturally 'strong' yet practically 'weak.' The priority for improvement is the development of the Pragmatic quadrant to ensure that the 'life' promised by the Spirit finds concrete expression in the life of the hearer."
