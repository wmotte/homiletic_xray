    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and health-promoting. It avoids the common trap of using the 'Critical Parent' to shame the congregation into 'Adapted Child' submission. Instead, it utilizes a strong 'Nurturing Parent' to awaken the 'Free Child's' sense of possibility and joy. By grounding the message in the 'Adult' reality of historical progress (civil rights) and personal biography, the preacher provides a reality-test for the hope he offers. The focus on the 'If' promotes autonomy rather than dependency.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The critique of 'television Christians' borders on Critical Parent elitism.",
      "The 'Morning Star' imagery, while beautiful, could be more clearly defined by the Adult ego to avoid being purely emotional."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize the 'If' as a tool for Adult responsibility. Ensure that the 'power over nations' promise is interpreted through the Adult lens of character and service rather than a Child's fantasy of omnipotence."
