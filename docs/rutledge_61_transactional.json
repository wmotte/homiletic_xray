    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The preacher actively deconstructs common religious games. He explicitly rejects the 'Bait & Switch' (whipping up sin to sell mercy) and avoids 'NIGYSOB' by placing himself in the same 'community of sinners' as the congregation."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exemplary model of psychologically healthy homiletics. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, inviting the listener into a reality-testing exercise regarding their own life. By rejecting the 'Bait & Switch' game and the Drama Triangle, the preacher fosters an environment of safety and authenticity. The focus on 'self-knowledge' and the removal of 'pretense' aligns with the TA goal of Autonomy (freedom from script and games).",
    "strengths": [
      "Deconstruction of manipulative 'guilt-mercy' cycles.",
      "High use of Adult data-processing to explain theological concepts.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the 'storm of the wrath of God' at the end briefly touches on a more Critical Parent tone, though it is mitigated by the substitutionary context."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'we' pronoun to maintain the Adult-Adult communal standing. The use of secular literature and art is an excellent way to keep the Adult ego state engaged."
