    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, engaging the listeners' cognitive faculties to bridge ancient history with modern ethics. By framing the gospel as 'dangerous' and 'radical,' the preacher avoids the trap of the Nurturing Parent who smothers the congregation with easy comfort. Instead, the preacher promotes autonomy by suggesting that the 'task' of interpretation belongs to the 'gospel people,' not just the experts. The lack of 'must/should' imperatives prevents the activation of the Adapted Child's guilt or rebellion.",
    "strengths": [

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Could incorporate more 'Free Child' imagery to balance the heavy 'Adult' intellectualism.",
      "Slight risk of being overly academic, which can sometimes be a 'Parental' distance-keeping mechanism."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' and 'our task' to maintain the Adult-Adult horizontal relationship. Ensure that the 'rage' mentioned in the text doesn't inadvertently trigger a 'Persecutor' role in the pulpit."
