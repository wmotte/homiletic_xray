          "To my ears this sounds something like saying to the astronaut... 'Have a nice trip.'",

        "analysis": "The preacher does not speak from a place of fear or a need to please a demanding deity. He admits to his own 'depressing' and 'bummed' feelings, which is a sign of a Child ego that is not overly adapted to 'perfect' religious expectations.",

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The sermon avoids games like ITHY (I'm Only Trying to Help You) because the preacher identifies with the 'doubter' rather than positioning himself as the superior solver of the problem.

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' The preacher uses his Adult ego to process reality and his Free Child to share authentic emotion, creating a transparent connection with the audience. By identifying with Thomas’s 'congenital pessimism,' he levels the playing field, moving away from a hierarchical Parent-Child dynamic. The sermon promotes autonomy by acknowledging that faith is a personal choice made in the absence of 'magical proofs,' thus avoiding the Drama Triangle.",
    "strengths": [
      "Vulnerable and authentic self-disclosure.",
      "Avoidance of shaming language regarding doubt.",
      "Strong Adult ego presence in biblical and cultural analysis."

      "The critique of 'Have a nice Easter' could be perceived as a minor Critical Parent moment, though it is softened by humor."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements and personal narratives that mirror the listener's struggle. This maintains an Adult-Adult transaction where the preacher is a fellow traveler rather than a moralizing Parent."
