    "risk_explanation": "The only risk is a slight 'Bait and Switch' regarding 'Magic,' but the preacher explicitly deconstructs the term, moving from social magic to theological 'intervention.'"

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and game-free. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state that integrates the reality of suffering (the 'monsters') with the Nurturing Parent's capacity for hope. By validating the 'jaded' perspective and the 'protest' of Ivan Karamazov, the preacher creates a safe space for the listener's own Adult ego to function. It avoids the common homiletical trap of 'smothering' the listener with false cheer or 'persecuting' them with moral demands. The result is an authentic invitation to faith that respects the listener's autonomy and intelligence.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of transparency and vulnerability.",
      "Avoidance of the Drama Triangle; the preacher does not play the Rescuer.",
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement with difficult theological and worldly realities."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from 'no magic' to 'real magic' (theology) could be seen as a semantic shift that might confuse the Adult ego's data processing.",
      "A slight risk of 'Ain't It Awful' when discussing the 'monsters,' though it is redeemed by the call to 'stand for humanity.'"
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name the 'objections' to the text within the sermon itself; this prevents the listener from feeling 'crossed' when their own Adult ego raises those same objections."
