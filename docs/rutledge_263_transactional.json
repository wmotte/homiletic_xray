    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of Nurturing Parent homiletics. It uses Adult-level cultural commentary (Dalai Lama, Richard Gere, Gallup polls) as a 'Con' to engage the listener before switching to a Critical Parent theological framework (Nicene Creed). While it avoids direct shaming, it fosters dependency by framing the human experience as a 'desperate fix' that only the preacher's specific dogma can resolve. The personal anecdote about the aunt provides a touch of Free Child authenticity, but it is quickly recruited back into the service of the Parent ego state.",

      "High reliance on 'Ain't It Awful' to create a need for the Gospel.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to maintain the Adult-Adult 'real conversation' throughout. Instead of using the 'desperate fix' of the world to force a 'Savior' conclusion, invite the congregation's Adult to reflect on how they experience 'The Master' in their own reality-testing."
