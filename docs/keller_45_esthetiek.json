    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The imagery is functional and serves the didactic purpose of the sermon. While the preacher uses the biblical image of 'broiled fish' effectively to ground the historical reality of the resurrection, the sermon often leans into conceptual metaphors (the 'receipt', the 'on/off switch') rather than sensory-rich biblical 'painting'. It follows Wilson's 'show, don't tell' only partially; it 'shows' the fish and the Costco receipt but 'tells' much of the theology through logical argumentation. The imagery of the eroded beach at Lake Erie provides a rare, poignant sensory moment that connects the abstract concept of 'irretrievability' to a felt reality. However, compared to a truly poetic-imagistic sermon, the language remains somewhat utilitarian.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and demonstrates high 'stewardship of language' in the vein of McEntyre. The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' almost entirely, or when using theological terms like 'Messiah' or 'Atonement', he defines them through historical and narrative context. There is a clear effort to do justice to the nuance of the 'modern paradigm' versus the biblical one. The word choice is economical; there is little 'fluff'. The precision is found in the way the preacher anticipates and articulates the hearer's objections ('I can't be a Christian because...'). This linguistic care creates a sense of intellectual honesty and respect for the listener.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a strong oral cadence, clearly written for the ear rather than the page. It uses a 'staccato' rhythm in its logical questioning ('Huh?', 'Why is that?', 'Really?') which creates an engaging, conversational flow. However, it lacks the 'legato' poetic quality or the rhythmic beauty found in more liturgical or contemplative preaching. The musicality is that of a skilled debater or teacher—rhythmic in its logic, but not particularly 'poetic' in its sound value. There is a repetitive structure in the three-point delivery that provides a predictable, steady beat, which aids memorability but limits aesthetic surprise.",

    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' and intellectual precision. It excels in stewardship of language by avoiding jargon and translating complex ideas into clear, contemporary idioms. While it lacks high poetic musicality or dense sensory imagery, its strength lies in its clarity and the 'rhythm of thought.' It is a pedagogical aesthetics: the beauty of an idea clearly expressed. The imagery used is strategic and illustrative rather than evocative or atmospheric, serving to ground the 'paradigm-shattering' claims of the text in the everyday reality of the hearer."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' as described by Lowry. It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with the claim that the resurrection is a historical fact, not a symbol, which creates immediate tension for the modern hearer. The 'turning point' is the shift from the historical/intellectual (Point 1 & 2) to the personal/existential (Point 3). The movement from 'inconvenient fact' to 'unimaginable hope' provides a satisfying arc. However, the structure is a traditional three-point model, which can feel somewhat static. The energy is sustained through the 'climax' of the Lake Erie illustration, which successfully moves the sermon from the head to the heart.",

        "Emmaus Never Happened; Emmaus Always Happens. See that? ... Okay. Let’s take that theory.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. It exemplifies Cilliers' 'reframing'. The preacher takes the ancient text (the fish, the Law, the Psalms) and uses it to reframe the modern secular paradigm (Epicureanism, The Lion King, secular skepticism). The integration is not forced; the 'broiled fish' becomes a direct answer to modern 'symbolic' readings. The connection between the 'receipt' at Costco and the 'justification' of Christ is a masterclass in contextualization. It honors the 'strangeness' of the biblical claim while making it hit home in a contemporary urban setting. It doesn't just apply the text; it lets the text 'shatter' the context's frames.",
      "quotes": [
        "If Jesus was raised from the dead, your feelings about those parts of the Bible are not relevant.",
        "One version of saying you do continue is The Lion King.",

        "The 'Law of Moses, Prophets, and Psalms' section is a bit dense for a general Easter audience.",
        "The transition to the 'Costco' example is effective but slightly lowers the 'sacred' tone of the Easter event."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing; it forces the hearer to look at their own life and death through the lens of the empty tomb."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward a 'closed' work of art. It is highly persuasive and apologetic, aiming to 'prove' and 'convince'. While it acknowledges the 'marvelous' nature of Easter, it quickly moves to resolve tensions with logical arguments. There is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or the 'holy mystery' that Stark or Cilliers advocate for. The preacher 'answers' the doubts rather than letting them sit in the space of the 'between'. However, the very end offers a slight opening: 'even if you don't believe... you should wish he were raised.' This invites the hearer into a space of desire rather than just intellectual assent, but the overall structure remains monovalent and prescriptive.",
      "quotes": [
        "The answer is it doesn’t symbolize anything. It couldn’t symbolize anything like that.",
        "If Jesus was raised from the dead then you’re just going to have to deal with the things the Bible says you don’t like.",
        "You should want that he was raised from the dead, and if you don’t want it, I don’t think you are in touch with your own heart."

      "strengths": [
        "Provides a clear, firm foundation for faith in a skeptical age.",

        "Allow more room for the 'startled and frightened' emotion of the disciples to linger before 'explaining' it.",
        "Reduce the 'logical necessity' language ('The answer is...', 'You have to...') to allow for more polyvalence.",
        "End with a more evocative image or question rather than a definitive psychological diagnosis of the hearer's heart."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A relatively closed, monovalent work of art focused on persuasion."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is robust and intellectually compelling. It follows a clear trajectory from historical evidence to theological significance to existential hope. The integration of text and context is superior, using 'reframing' to challenge modern secular paradigms. However, the structure is quite 'closed'; it functions more as a brilliant lecture or a legal defense than an 'open work of art'. It prioritizes clarity and conviction over mystery and polyvalence. The movement is logical and cumulative, leading the hearer to a 'forced' but hopeful conclusion."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by acknowledging that historical facts are 'inconvenient' and 'discouraging'. It doesn't offer 'immediate comfort' but forces the hearer to grapple with the 'nasty, brutish, and short' reality of life and the 'stench' of irretrievability (the eroded beach). The emotions evoked—especially regarding the loss of the childhood cottage—feel authentic rather than sentimental. By framing the resurrection as a 'paradigm-shattering fact' rather than a 'lovely story', the preacher bypasses the typical Easter kitsch of 'springtime and flowers'.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The mention of 'The Lion King' could border on kitsch, but it is used critically to deconstruct a cliché rather than to promote one.",
      "The final 'Hallelujah' is slightly conventional, but supported by the preceding 20 minutes of rigorous thought."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'irretrievability of life' as a 'death in the midst of life'.",
      "The intellectual honesty regarding 'parts of the Bible I just don’t accept'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of intellectual rigor; it is the best defense against kitsch. Continue to use 'secular' sources (Poe, Epicurus) to ground the sermon in real-world gravity."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'weak Messiah' theology. By emphasizing that the resurrection is for those who 'admit they are weak' and 'admit they are sinners', the preacher creates a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) that is not dependent on human virtue. However, the 'dogmatic sealing' of the argument (the 'receipt' metaphor) slightly closes the space by making grace seem like a transaction rather than a mystery. The sermon sustains the tension between 'already' and 'not yet' through the imagery of restoration, but the 'Space' is more of a 'Courtroom for Grace' than a 'Space for Wonder'.",
    "tension_sustained": "Sustains the tension between the 'inconvenience' of the Bible and the 'hope' of the resurrection.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery is somewhat subordinated to logical explanation, but the 'marvelous' nature of Easter is acknowledged.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails strongly; the sermon explicitly argues against a 'strong Messiah for the strong' (moralism).",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'marvelous' and 'startling' elements of the text to breathe more. Not every 'Why?' in the text needs an immediate 'The answer is...'"
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'Apologetic-Didactic' preaching. Its beauty lies in its clarity, its logical architecture, and its profound 'stewardship of language'. It avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by refusing to sentimentalize the resurrection, instead presenting it as a disruptive historical fact. The 'reframing' of modern secular life through the lens of the 'broiled fish' and the 'suffering servant' is masterfully executed. While it lacks the poetic density of a Wilson or the liturgical mystery of a Cilliers, it possesses a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that is highly effective for its target audience. The sermon functions as a 'witness' (Long) that uses the form of a logical argument to deliver a message of radical grace. The aesthetic experience for the hearer is one of 'intellectual relief'—the feeling of a complex puzzle finally clicking into place.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of secular paradigms using biblical historical markers.",
      "Authentic, non-kitsch treatment of human loss and 'irretrievability'.",
      "Exceptional clarity and precision in translating theological concepts for a modern audience."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Over-reliance on 'closed' logical structures; could benefit from more 'open' poetic spaces.",
      "The imagery is often mechanical (receipts, switches) rather than organic or sensory.",
      "The 'teacher' persona occasionally overshadows the 'witness' or 'poet' persona."

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Apologetic-Didactic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Thomas G. Long's 'Preacher as Witness' and Johan Cilliers' 'Reframing', though it lacks Ciska Stark's 'Openness'.",
    "audience_analysis": "Skeptical professionals, urban intellectuals, and those weary of sentimental 'kitsch' religion.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves a central question for the hearer to carry home.",
      "Incorporate more 'legato' passages of pure praise or lament to balance the 'staccato' logic.",
      "Use one central, recurring sensory image instead of multiple illustrative metaphors."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A high-quality sermon that achieves its aesthetic goals through precision and reframing. It is a model of how to avoid kitsch in a holiday setting. While it could risk being 'too closed' for those seeking mystery, its intellectual integrity creates a unique 'space for grace' that respects the modern hearer's struggle. It is aesthetically 'good' (7/10) because the form (logical, shattering, clear) perfectly matches the content (the resurrection as a paradigm-shattering fact)."
