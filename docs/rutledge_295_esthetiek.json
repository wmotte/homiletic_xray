    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating 'cinematic' moments, particularly in the New York vignette. The preacher follows Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' by describing the 'iron gates pulled down... like mausoleums.' This sensory detail grounds the theological concept of 'lifelessness' before the Resurrection. The imagery of the 'dazzlingly silhouetted' usher provides a visual 'reframing' of reality. However, the biblical portion relies more on traditional narrative retelling than fresh sensory expansion of the upper room, though the 'brushfire' metaphor for the Gospel's spread is effective. The use of newsmagazine covers as a visual starting point successfully bridges the gap between secular 'seeing' and sacred 'believing.'",
      "quotes": [
        "rows and rows of antique stores locked and bolted with iron gates pulled down over their fronts like mausoleums",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise and avoids heavy 'Canaanite' jargon. The preacher exhibits 'stewardship of language' by critiquing sloppy greetings like 'Have a nice Easter,' contrasting them with the weight of the Resurrection. There is a clear effort to define faith not as 'intellectual assent' but as a 'stance of the whole person.' The word choice is sophisticated yet accessible, fitting the academic context of Sewanee. However, the use of 'bummed' and 'hey, your man made it' leans toward a casualness that occasionally threatens the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed/Episcopal tradition, though it serves to humanize the preacher.",
      "quotes": [
        "To my ears this sounds something like saying to the astronaut leaving for Venus, 'Have a nice trip.'",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a conversational cadence that works well for an oral event. There is a nice use of parallelism in the conclusion ('no legal arguments, no signs, no stigmata'). The rhythm of the NYC story builds well toward the 'irresistible impulse' of the shout across Broadway. However, the middle section regarding Thomas's biblical history (Chapter 11, Chapter 14) feels more like a lecture or a commentary, slowing the rhythmic momentum. The 'Alleluia! Amen' provides a standard liturgical 'legato' finish, but the overall structure is more narrative-driven than poetically rhythmic.",
      "quotes": [
        "I got up by myself, dressed by myself, drank my Carnation Instant Breakfast by myself, and drove into the city by myself.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 6.67,
    "summary_language": "The sermon demonstrates a high degree of linguistic care, particularly in its narrative 'showing.' The NYC vignette is a masterclass in using sensory detail to mirror internal spiritual states. While it occasionally dips into casual colloquialisms ('bummed'), it maintains a 'stewardship of language' by challenging empty religious clichés. The imagery is vivid and grounds the abstract theology of the Resurrection in the 'iron-bound' reality of the world. It is more narrative than poetic, prioritizing the 'witness' of the story over the musicality of the prose."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a sophisticated 'Lowry Loop' or narrative arc. It begins with a modern 'upsetting of equilibrium' (the depressing NYC Easter), moves into the biblical 'trouble' (Thomas’s obstinacy), and finds its turning point in the 'boundless graciousness' of Jesus meeting Thomas's demands. The structure is not a static three-point list but a journey from the 'mausoleum' of Broadway to the 'open door' of faith. The preacher successfully maintains tension by delaying the resolution of Thomas's doubt until the final beatitude, which reframes the entire congregation as the 'blessed' ones.",
      "quotes": [
        "I was beginning to feel really bummed.",
        "Thomas stayed away, and he missed it!",
        "the Lord looks up and out and across the generations into the future... speaking to you and to me"

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The integration is strong, particularly through the concept of 'reframing' (Cilliers). The preacher uses the 'iron gates' of Broadway to reframe the 'locked doors' of the disciples. The context of 1996 skepticism (the newsmagazines) is integrated as a modern version of Thomas’s 'show me' attitude. The synthesis is organic: the preacher doesn't just 'apply' the text at the end; he lives the text through his own story. The 'strangeness' of the Resurrection is maintained by contrasting it with the 'nice trip' banality of modern greetings.",
      "quotes": [
        "consisting as they do of rows and rows of antique stores locked and bolted... like mausoleums",
        "Thomas was a believer in Murphy’s law, so to speak. He sensed that Jesus was going to die",

      "strengths": [
        "The 'locked doors' of the upper room are brilliantly mirrored in the 'iron gates' of NYC.",

      "reframing_present": "Yes; reality is reframed from a 'lifeless Sunday' to a 'Day of Resurrection' through the liturgical greeting."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is largely an 'open work of art' (Stark) because it invites the hearer into the 'space of the between'—between seeing and not seeing. By identifying the congregation with the 'last beatitude,' the preacher leaves the 'completion' of the sermon to the hearer's own faith. However, the middle section becomes somewhat 'closed' when it provides a definitive psychological profile of Thomas ('congenital pessimist'). While helpful for the narrative, it slightly limits the polyvalence of the biblical character. The ending is invitational, though the final paragraph summarizes the point a bit too neatly.",
      "quotes": [
        "What would it take to convince you? What would it take?",
        "the Lord looks up and out and across the generations into the future",
        "Magical proofs have I none, but what I have I give you"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The use of direct questions ('What would it take?') creates interpretive space.",
        "The preacher admits his own 'bummed' state, allowing room for the hearer's own struggle.",
        "The focus on 'trust' rather than 'proof' keeps the work from being dogmatically sealed."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The psychological labeling of Thomas ('congenital pessimist') is a bit reductive.",
        "The final paragraph 'explains' the sermon's mechanism (the 'bond of trust') rather than letting it linger.",
        "The 'Happy Easter' vs 'Blessed Feast' section is a bit prescriptive/moralistic about language."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly open; it functions as an invitation to a 'bond of trust' rather than a logical proof."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon possesses a very strong dramaturgical arc, moving from a bleak, modern 'mausoleum' to the expansive grace of the Resurrection. It avoids the 'three-point' trap by weaving a continuous narrative that integrates the preacher's biography with the biblical text. The 'reframing' of the congregation as the subjects of Jesus' final beatitude is a powerful structural move. While it occasionally over-explains its themes toward the end, it successfully creates a 'happening' where the ancient greeting becomes a present reality."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by starting in the genuine 'dreary and depressing' reality of a lonely NYC morning. The preacher does not offer 'cheap comfort'; he acknowledges the 'shameful death of a condemned criminal.' The emotion feels authentic because it is rooted in concrete, unglamorous details (Carnation Instant Breakfast, iron gates). It avoids the 'sentiment' of Easter by critiquing the 'Have a nice Easter' culture. The 'space for grace' is earned through the recognition of 'obstinate disbelief.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'secular friend' saying 'Hey, your man made it!' feels slightly like a 'preacher's story' cliché.",
      "The 'brushfire' metaphor is a standard religious trope."

      "The description of drinking Carnation Instant Breakfast alone on Easter morning.",
      "The visceral 'shout' across Broadway as a moment of genuine, unscripted joy."

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by emphasizing that Jesus meets Thomas 'all the way and from beyond all the way.' The sermon avoids moralism by stating that 'grace goes before knowledge of sin.' It sustains the tension of 'not seeing' without resolving it through 'magical proofs.' However, the space is slightly narrowed by the preacher's firm psychological categorization of Thomas, which leaves less room for the 'mystery' of Thomas's own heart. Overall, the sermon successfully creates a 'space for grace' by moving the focus from human effort (seeing/proving) to the divine gift (the beatitude).",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'iron-bound' world and the 'risen' Lord is sustained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the Resurrection is respected as a 'bond of trust' rather than a solved puzzle.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the sermon is about what Jesus says to us, not what we must do for Him.",
    "recommendation": "Allow Thomas to remain more of a mystery; don't 'solve' his personality so quickly."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of narrative homiletics that successfully employs the 'aesthetic turn.' Its primary strength lies in its 'reframing' of the Resurrection through a gritty, urban lens, avoiding the saccharine kitsch often associated with Easter. By using the 'iron gates' of Manhattan as a metaphor for the 'locked doors' of the heart and the tomb, the preacher creates a visual and emotional resonance that bridges the 2000-year gap. The language is 'stewarded' well, with a sharp eye for the sound and impact of liturgical greetings. While the middle section leans slightly toward a teaching mode that slows the 'event,' the overall arc is dynamic and leads the hearer to a surprising and gracious conclusion. It respects the 'sober beauty' of the tradition while being fully present in the modern world. It is a 'witness' (Long) that creates a 'space for grace' (Cilliers) by refusing to offer easy proofs, instead offering the 'gift of faith' as a communal 'happening.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "The cinematic 'NYC Easter' narrative that grounds the theology in sensory reality.",
      "The structural 'reframing' of the congregation as the recipients of the final beatitude.",
      "The absence of religious kitsch and the critique of 'cheap' liturgical language."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The rhythmic dip in the middle section caused by academic citations.",
      "The slight over-explanation/summarization in the final paragraph.",

    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Thomas Long's 'Witness' model and Paul Scott Wilson's 'Four Pages' (Trouble/Grace balance).",
    "audience_analysis": "Appeals to 'modern Thomases'—intellectually skeptical but spiritually hungry hearers who appreciate honesty over sentiment.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with ending on the biblical text itself to increase 'openness'.",
      "Use more sensory language in the biblical retelling to match the quality of the personal anecdotes.",
      "Reduce the use of 'preacher-isms' like 'don't you think?' to maintain the dramatic fourth wall."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically successful sermon that honors the 'aesthetic turn' by making the 'holy happen' in the intersection of Broadway and the Gospel. It avoids the pitfalls of kitsch and moralism, offering instead a sophisticated, 'sober' beauty that invites the hearer into a living bond of trust. It is a strong model of how to use personal narrative not as an end in itself, but as a window into the 'Space for Grace.'"
