  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'theological weight' used to create psychological dependency. While it uses Adult-level data (news, history) to engage the mind, its primary psychological movement is to dismantle the listener's Adult ego ('you have no free will') and replace it with a binary of total failure vs. total rescue. This reinforces a Parent-Child dynamic where the listener is discouraged from personal responsibility in favor of a passive 'rectification'.",
    "strengths": [
      "High intellectual engagement and Adult-level data processing.",
      "Effective use of self-disclosure (procrastination) to lower defenses."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The total dismissal of 'Free Will' can lead to psychological passivity and learned helplessness.",
      "The 'War' metaphor creates a high-anxiety environment (Critical Parent)."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the listener's Adult ego as a partner in the Spirit rather than a 'defector' in a war. Acknowledge that while 'grace' is a gift, the Adult ego plays a role in the 'here-and-now' application of that grace, moving from dependency to autonomy."
