        "analysis": "Coercion is absent in the traditional religious sense. However, there is a strong moral imperative regarding social justice that borders on a 'Nurturing Parent' becoming a 'Critical Parent' toward those who don't act.",

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The sermon avoids 'ITHY' (I'm only trying to help you) by refusing to offer a simple solution to grief or doubt. It avoids 'NIGYSOB' by identifying with the doubters rather than judging them. It avoids 'Ain't it Awful' by moving from the description of suffering to 'Insurrection' (action)."

    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This is a remarkably healthy sermon from a TA perspective. It avoids the 'Parental' trap of religious certainty and the 'Child' trap of emotional manipulation. By validating doubt and 'not-knowing,' the preacher strengthens the listener's Adult ego. The shift from 'Resurrection' to 'Insurrection' moves the listener from a passive 'Victim' of fate to an 'Adult' agent of change.",
    "strengths": [

      "The critique of 'Glaubensversicherten' could be perceived as a Critical Parent 'NIGYSOB' toward more conservative listeners.",
      "The jump to global politics at the end is very fast, potentially overwhelming the Adult ego's capacity to process."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I-messages' when discussing faith. To stay game-free when discussing social justice, ensure the 'must' remains a personal conviction shared Adult-to-Adult rather than a Parental command."
