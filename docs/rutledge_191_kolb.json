    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively utilizes high-stakes human scenarios to ground abstract concepts. The opening imagery of a parent's desperation for a self-destructing child provides a visceral 'hook'. It successfully invites the hearer to inhabit a specific emotional state before introducing the biblical text. However, the transition from the parent metaphor to the Trinitarian formula is somewhat abrupt, relying on the metaphor to do the heavy lifting for a complex theological doctrine.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher pauses to examine the human condition, particularly the nature of sin and the 'depths'. There is a clear attempt to analyze why the Trinitarian blessing matters by looking at the 'crabbed, tumultuous' nature of Paul's letter. The analysis of the removal of 'miserable offenders' from the prayer book serves as a cultural/liturgical critique. However, the 'why' behind human resistance to God's love could be more deeply explored beyond liturgical changes.",

      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher moves from the 'feeling' of the parent to the 'logic' of the Trinity. The definition of the Trinity as 'self-giving love' and 'dynamic interrelatedness' provides a clear theological framework. The exegesis of Psalm 130, specifically the paradoxical relationship between forgiveness and the 'fear of the Lord', offers significant intellectual depth without becoming overly academic.",

The application remains largely internal and dispositional. The hearer is told to 'think' and 'worship', but the 'How should we respond?' in a practical, ethical, or social sense is missing.

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of theological and liturgical preaching that prioritizes Abstract Conceptualization and Reflective Observation. It begins with a compelling Concrete Experience (the parent metaphor) that successfully bridges the gap between the hearer's life and the complex doctrine of the Trinity. The preacher excels at 'Normative' tasks, bringing Scripture into a deep dialogue with the human condition. However, the sermon lacks a developed 'Active Experimentation' phase. It provides the 'what' and the 'why' with clarity and poetic force but leaves the 'how' largely to the hearer's imagination. The result is a sermon that is intellectually and emotionally stimulating but practically thin. It addresses the 'Assimilating' and 'Diverging' learning styles effectively but may leave the 'Converging' learner without a clear path forward.",

      "Balance the theological depth with a 'Converging' element to engage action-oriented learners."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a well-crafted theological reflection that successfully navigates the first three phases of Kolb's cycle. It is particularly strong in its 'Normative' and 'Interpretive' tasks, offering the congregation a robust vision of God's character. Its primary diagnostic failure is the lack of a 'Pragmatic' landing. While it effectively moves the hearer to 'feel' and 'think', it stops short of helping them 'do'. For a congregation seeking intellectual and spiritual depth, this sermon is effective; for a congregation seeking guidance on Christian living in a complex world, it requires more practical 'handles'."
