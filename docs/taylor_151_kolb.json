      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience through specific, vivid illustrations and physical markers of history. It moves beyond abstract theology by grounding the 'name' in the physical geography of Asia Minor and the preacher's personal travels. However, it lacks a direct 'slice of life' contemporary narrative involving the congregation's daily struggles, relying instead on historical and artistic anecdotes to create feeling.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Reflective observation is present but somewhat underdeveloped. The preacher pauses to consider the human condition—specifically the limitations of human language and the reality of temptation—but often moves quickly to theological answers. The 'problem' of the sermon (the impossibility of describing Christ) is more of a rhetorical framing than a deep exploration of a human or social struggle.",

It successfully grounds the 'name of Jesus' in both historical reality and theological depth. However, it falls short of a complete Kolb cycle by failing to provide concrete 'Active Experimentation.' The preacher functions primarily as an Advocate and an Artist, providing a rich 'Declarative' and 'Visionary' experience. While the sermon addresses the 'Assimilating' and 'Diverging' learners effectively through logical frameworks and poetic imagery, the 'Converging' learner—who asks 'How does this work for me tomorrow?'—is left with few specific handles. The movement through the 'Homiletic Window' is strategically sound but remains largely in the upper quadrants of theory and inspiration, neglecting the lower quadrants of practical application.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a robust theological exploration that succeeds in its primary goal: exalting the name of Jesus Christ. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'Head and Heart' sermon that provides excellent conceptual frameworks and visionary inspiration. Its diagnostic priority for improvement is the 'Hands'—the conversion of high theology into low-altitude, daily practice. While the preacher's role as Advocate and Artist is well-executed, the role of Guide/Coach is nearly absent. To move from a score of 6 to an 8, the sermon would need to bridge the gap between the 'grand theme' and the 'gritty reality' of the hearer's specific, daily ethical choices."
