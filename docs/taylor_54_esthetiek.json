    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes strong, archetypal imagery to ground abstract concepts of 'searching.' The preacher moves from the biological (the 'thin spinal column' of a baby) to the cultural (the 'Louisiana swamp country'). The imagery is particularly effective when describing the physical space of the church, using the 'sixty-five-foot arch' and 'forty rows of pews' to visualize the temptation of pride. However, some images lean toward the traditional or expected (the 'Good Shepherd', 'Lamb of God'), which, while biblically grounded, borders on the conventional. The strength lies in the 'painting' of the Camelot scene, which provides a cinematic backdrop for the theme of mortality. The preacher follows Wilson's 'show, don't tell' by describing the 'barge draped in black' rather than just discussing grief abstractly.",
      "quotes": [
        "The crawling baby standing up or falling down is searching for the posture of standing erect, supported by that thin spinal column that carries so much weight.",
        "Up and down the cool corridors with their floor-to-ceiling banners, they had walked and bantered and laughed and talked.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally careful and exhibits high 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre). The preacher avoids modern jargon, opting instead for a dignified, almost Victorian vocabulary ('cavorting', 'intermediary', 'suppositions'). There is a clear precision in the way human development is categorized (infant, toddler, teenager, young adult). The use of the Creole neighbor's quote provides a sharp, linguistic contrast that highlights the theme of 'ambition' without being condescending. The preacher demonstrates 'loving language' by acknowledging the 'infirmities' of his comrades in Harlem with dignity rather than pity. The precision here is not academic but poetic, ensuring each word carries weight.",
      "quotes": [
        "The teenager — the adolescent — blushing and stammering, is searching for identity.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is highly musical, characteristic of the African American pulpit tradition. It utilizes 'legato' for the descriptions of Camelot and 'staccato' for the repetitive refrain: 'Get hold of him right there.' The rhythm is built through parallelism and anaphora ('We would see Jesus...'). There is a palpable cadence that suggests an oral performance designed to build toward a crescendo. The sentence structure is varied, using short, punchy declarations to punctuate longer, flowing narrative passages. The repetition of 'Gone, gone, gone!' serves as a percussive beat that emphasizes the finality of death before the 'musical' resolution of the resurrection.",
      "quotes": [
        "The bawling infant... The crawling baby... The toddling kindergarten child... The teenager...",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The language is a sophisticated blend of high-literary rhetoric and soulful, concrete imagery. It avoids the 'Canaanite' jargon of the academy while maintaining a 'stewardship of words' that feels both dignified and accessible. The imagery is cinematic, particularly in the use of the Arthurian legend to illustrate mortality. The musicality is the sermon's greatest micro-aesthetic strength, using repetition and rhythmic parallelisms to create a sense of inevitability and emotional resonance. It is 'sober beauty' that remains transparent toward the subject: the person of Jesus."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a thematic 'plot' rather than a strict narrative arc. It begins with the 'search' (the upsetting of equilibrium) and moves through the various stages of human life. The 'turning point' is the realization that human ambition and mortality cannot be satisfied by the self, leading to the need to 'see Jesus.' However, the structure is somewhat episodic—moving from ambition to brokenness to mortality. While each section is strong, they feel like 'beads on a string' rather than a single, driving narrative. The energy remains high, but the 'conflict' is resolved multiple times in different categories rather than building to one singular dramatic climax.",
      "quotes": [
        "All of life is a search, sometimes a painful one.",
        "The preacher needed to see that! Never mind your skill of oratory.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The integration is handled through the lens of 'reframing' (Cilliers). The preacher takes the ancient search of the Greeks and reframes it as the universal human search for meaning, identity, and security. The 'context' of the 10th anniversary is woven in naturally, using the church's name and history as a springboard. The 'strangeness' of the Greeks is acknowledged but quickly translated into a psychological archetype of the 'searcher.' The synthesis is most successful when the preacher places the biblical text ('Sir, we would see Jesus') literally onto the floor of his own pulpit, bridging the gap between the 1st-century text and the 20th-century task of preaching.",
      "quotes": [
        "You were, and we all are, a pilgrim people.",
        "I asked that there be put down on the floor of the pulpit the words, 'Sir, we would see Jesus.'",
        "What is wrong in our nation would be set right if people who name his name could get hold of his Spirit."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'nation' reference is a bit general; a more specific 'reframing' of a contemporary social issue would strengthen the context.",
        "The connection between the Greeks' philosophy and modern 'theories of life' could be more sharply drawn.",
        "Spend more time on why the Greeks *specifically* wanted to see Jesus to honor the 'strangeness' of the text."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes, it reframes the 'church anniversary' not as a celebration of success, but as a continuation of a primal, human search."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward a 'closed' structure in its theological resolutions, but maintains 'openness' in its emotional honesty. By addressing the 'brokenness' and 'mortality' of the hearers, it acknowledges the ambivalence of existence (Stark). However, the resolutions ('Thy sins are forgiven', 'I am the resurrection') are delivered with a dogmatic certainty that leaves little room for the hearer's own struggle with these truths. It is a 'witnessing' sermon (Long) that presents Christ as the answer to every category. While comforting, it risks being 'sealed shut' by providing immediate answers to the deep tensions of the 'Round Table' being dissolved.",
      "quotes": [
        "You do not have to wait to follow the Lord until you understand everything about him. You never will.",
        "Who can say a truly comforting word to us? ... 'Sir, we would see Jesus!'",
        "I rest your dearest hope upon the integrity of my word."

      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges that we will never fully 'comprehend the Lord Christ'.",
        "Honest treatment of the 'darkening days' and 'strange faces' of aging.",
        "The ending is an invitation to hope rather than a moralistic command."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Allow the questions of the 'Bedivere' section to linger longer before providing the 'Resurrection' answer.",
        "Use more 'open' metaphors for grace that allow the hearer to imagine how it applies to their specific 'brokenness'.",
        "Avoid the 'happy ending' feel by acknowledging that the 'search' continues even after seeing Jesus."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent; it is a 'proclamation' that seeks to provide a definitive answer to the human search."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is a thematic journey that effectively links the biblical narrative to the universal human experience. While it lacks a singular, driving 'Lowry-esque' plot, it maintains momentum through a series of emotional movements—from the optimism of ambition to the despair of the grave. The integration of the 10th-anniversary context is seamless. The sermon is more 'closed' than 'open,' acting as a powerful witness that offers Christ as the definitive resolution to the tensions raised, though it does so with enough poetic depth to avoid feeling like a 'coercive schema'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids religious kitsch by grounding its comfort in the 'pain of suffering.' The description of the 'Louisiana swamp country' and the 'infirmities' of the friends in Harlem feels authentic rather than sentimental. The use of the Arthurian legend to discuss death provides an aesthetic distance that prevents the sermon from becoming 'saccharine.' However, some of the 'Jesus-answers' (e.g., 'Thy sins are forgiven. Your slate is wiped clean.') border on the clichéd 'happy ending' that Cilliers warns against. The depth is saved by the preacher's willingness to sit with the 'darkened days' and 'strange faces' of Bedivere's lament.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'one hundredfold in this life' section feels slightly like a 'pre-chewed' prosperity promise.",
      "The 'slate is wiped clean' metaphor is a common religious cliché."

      "The description of the 'thin spinal column' of the baby.",
      "The honest admission of the preacher's own potential for vanity in the new sanctuary."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To increase depth, the preacher could explore the 'silence' of Jesus or the 'unanswered' parts of the search, avoiding the move to 'total resolution' too quickly."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened primarily through the admission of human limitation. By stating that 'Nobody fully comprehends the Lord Christ,' the preacher creates a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) that is not dependent on human intellect. The sermon moves between the 'already' of the church's success and the 'not yet' of the members' mortality. The 'mystery' is respected in the acknowledgment that we are 'more than what we were, but not what we want to be.' The sermon avoids heavy moralization, focusing instead on the 'gift' of seeing Jesus.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained well in the mortality section, though resolved quickly in the ambition section.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, specifically regarding the incomprehensibility of Christ.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the focus is on 'seeing' and 'receiving' rather than 'doing' or 'achieving'.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'brokenness' to remain a bit more 'broken' before the word of forgiveness, to let the grace feel even more 'unmerited'."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the 'witnessing' style of preaching. Its primary strength lies in its 'Poetics of Language'—the rhythmic, almost hypnotic use of repetition and the high-literary framing of universal human experiences. It avoids the 'kitsch' of easy sentimentality by grounding its hope in the stark realities of the life cycle and the 'chilly winter morning' of grief. While the structure is more thematic than narrative, the 'reframing' of the pulpit as a place where the preacher must also 'see Jesus' is a masterstroke of homiletic aesthetics, creating a sense of shared pilgrimage between the speaker and the hearer. The sermon successfully opens a 'space for grace' by pointing away from the preacher's 'skill of oratory' toward the 'integrity' of the Divine word. It is a 'sober-reformed' aesthetic that has been enriched by the 'musical-dramatic' traditions of the Black Church, resulting in a text that is both authoritative and deeply human.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rhythmic musicality and use of anaphora ('Sir, we would see Jesus').",
      "Sophisticated use of literary 'reframing' (Arthurian legend/Michelangelo).",

      "Tighter narrative arc to move beyond an episodic 'point' structure.",
      "Fresher metaphors for the 'grace' sections to avoid religious clichés.",

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Oratorical (High-Church Black Homiletic)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Thomas G. Long's 'Preacher as Witness' and Paul Scott Wilson's 'Imagery' focus.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who appreciate 'dignified' rhetoric, literary depth, and a sense of historical continuity.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a 'Lowry Loop' structure to increase dramatic tension.",
      "Incorporate more 'sensory' details from the biblical world (the 'feast' in John 12).",
      "Use one less literary illustration to allow more space for the biblical text to 'breathe'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically 'strong' sermon (7.2) that excels in language care and rhythmic performance. It serves as a model for how to use 'secular' literature (Tennyson) to illuminate 'sacred' longing. While it resolves its tensions a bit too neatly for a modern 'open work of art,' its sheer oratorical power and authentic pastoral heart create a compelling 'event' where the holy is invited to happen."
