    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The factual content is built on a clear binary structure: the 'Empire' (Pilate) vs. the 'Kingdom' (Jesus). The preacher utilizes historical-critical and socio-political context to define the 'Sache'. However, the exegesis is heavily filtered through a modern socio-political lens (white power, money power, immigration). While this makes the 'Sache' accessible, it risks reducing the ontological depth of the Christological event to a socio-ethical conflict. The theological 'Sache'—the living Christ—is presented as an advocate for the marginalized. The dogmatic weight of the atonement is largely replaced by the theme of 'truth' and 'justice'. It is comprehensible but leans more towards a sociological lecture than a deep dive into the mystery of the cross.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a strong prophetic-political identity. There is a clear 'Selbstdarstellung' as a socially conscious intellectual who critiques modern systems of oppression. The 'I' is largely hidden behind the 'We' or the 'Observer' role, yet the choice of vocabulary (e.g., 'fake news', 'white power') 'leaks' a specific ideological location. There is little involuntary 'Selbstenthüllung' regarding personal doubt or personal need for grace; the preacher speaks from a position of moral clarity. This creates a distance where the preacher is the 'analyzer' rather than a 'fellow sinner' under the cross.",
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Schizoid-Compulsive. The preacher maintains a cool, analytical distance (Schizoid) while adhering to a very strict, binary structural logic (Compulsive).",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' serves the political interpretation of the text rather than the existential vulnerability of the faith experience.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher to Students' or 'Prosecutor to Jury'. The preacher places the congregation in the role of the 'disciples' or the 'deciders'. There is a subtle paternalism in the way contemporary political labels are applied to the biblical text, essentially telling the congregation how to categorize their world. The 'yellow' signal is one of challenge: 'I am showing you the real truth, and you must decide.' This can feel 'teaching from above', as the preacher has already determined what the 'truth' looks like (justice, mercy, anti-supremacy).",
      "quotes": [
        "It is a trial in which we get to participate.",

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward 'Anspruch' (Demand). The appeal is for the listener to reject 'imperial' values and choose the 'truth' of Jesus. While the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is present in the description of God as the advocate for the widow and orphan, it is framed as a call to align with this God. The Gospel (Gift) is almost entirely subsumed by the ethical requirement to side with the marginalized. The 'red' side dominates the end: 'we get to decide the verdict.' This places the burden of the Good Friday outcome on the human will, which is theologically precarious from a Barthian perspective.",
      "quotes": [
        "We get to decide the verdict.",
        "The verdict will not be long in coming.",
        "He means, rather, that his authority is not derived from Rome."

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Anspruch (Demand) outweighs Zuspruch (Promise). The cross is a 'test' for us rather than a 'finished work' for us.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "High. The sermon risks becoming a moral imperative to be 'on the right side of history'.",
      "strengths": [
        "Strong call to action.",

    "dominant_side": "Red (Appeal)",
    "disruptions": "The primary disruption is the 'Relationship Noise' caused by the injection of modern political buzzwords into the Passion narrative, which may cause the 'Factual Ear' to shut down.",
    "healing_disruption": "The 'Healing Disruption' is the challenge to the 'imperial' way of life, forcing the listener to confront their own complicity in 'power' systems."

  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 5.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a sharp, structurally sound piece of rhetoric that successfully bridges the ancient text with contemporary social concerns. However, from a homiletical and psychological perspective, it suffers from an 'Appeal-overload'. By framing the trial of Jesus as a trial where 'we decide the verdict,' the preacher shifts the focus from God's action (Immink's 'Acting Subject') to human decision-making. Theologically, this leans toward a 'theologia crucis' that is more about our imitation of Christ's social position than about the divine mystery of reconciliation. The psychological 'Riemann' profile suggests a preacher who values clarity and challenge over pastoral warmth or existential comfort. The 'Blue' side is well-developed but serves a 'Red' agenda, leaving the 'Yellow' relationship somewhat strained by the intensity of the political parallels.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is significant 'psychologization' and 'sociologization'. God is at risk of becoming an object/symbol of our social justice movements rather than the Sovereign Lord who judges and saves us.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Strong rhetorical structure.",
      "Vivid contemporary imagery.",
      "High sense of urgency."

    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Balance 'Anspruch' with more 'Zuspruch'.",
      "Reduce the reliance on polarizing political terminology.",
      "Incorporate the 'fides qua'—the personal trust in the Savior."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A provocative sermon that functions well as a prophetic challenge but falls short of the communicative balance required for a holistic Good Friday proclamation."
