    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically complex. It avoids the 'pious trap' of Critical Parent dogmatism but risks falling into 'Ain't It Awful' regarding political structures. Its greatest strength is the movement from the Adapted Child (resignation) to the Adult (counting days/taking responsibility). It uses the preacher's own vulnerability to model an Adult-Child integration.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To further reduce 'Formula G' risks, ensure the transition between personal grief and political critique is more Adult-driven (logical connection) rather than emotional 'Bait & Switch'. Continue to emphasize the 'Co-worker' role to keep the congregation out of the 'Victim' role of the Drama Triangle."
