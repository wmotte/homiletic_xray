Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home. [...] For all its sins, though they be many, the church is still the Body of Christ himself. You are loved by our Lord. There is no limit to the love of Christ which overcomes the sin within his Body. Please come back.",

  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a robust exegetical framework, specifically targeting the Johannine 'Hour' and the symbolic role of the Mother of Jesus. She successfully deconstructs the sentimental 'Mother's Day' misinterpretation, replacing it with a dogmatic ecclesiology. The 'Sache' (the living Christ) is presented as the architect of a new kinship. The transition from the local (Cana) to the universal (the Cross) is handled with intellectual precision. However, the 'blue' side occasionally leans heavily on academic citations (Hoskyns, Cyprian, Stella), which risks turning the pulpit into a lecture hall, though the theological depth remains anchored in the text's 'Hour'—the turning point of the cosmos.",
      "quotes": [
        "In the Fourth Gospel, the mother of our Lord plays a quite different role.",
        "The idea of 'the hour' is the heart and center of the Fourth Gospel.",
        "Hebrew is the language of the Jewish nation, but now... the King of the Jews is revealed as the King of the empire."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong exegetical correction of sentimentalism.",
        "Clear connection between the Greek 'Hour' and the arrival of the Gentiles."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The reliance on multiple secular quotes (Frank Stella, Journey's End) slightly dilutes the biblical 'Sache'.",
        "The distinction between 'Mary' in Luke vs. John could be more concisely integrated."
      ],
      "comprehensibility_check": "Appropriate for an educated urban congregation; uses academic concepts (ecclesia, Johannine drama) without being inaccessible."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals herself as a seasoned, slightly weary but faithful member of the institution. There is a clear 'diaconal' quality to her 'I'; she uses her 60-year marriage and her experience of a 'broken heart' regarding the church not for self-aggrandizement, but to validate the difficulty of the 'yellow' (relational) claim. She reveals a distaste for American individualism and sentimentality. There is a sense of 'controlled passion'—she is not seeking the stage (Hysterical) but rather maintaining the order of the message (Compulsive/Depressive mix). Her self-revelation serves to bridge the gap between the 'horror' of the cross and the 'heedless throngs' of Fifth Avenue.",
      "quotes": [
        "I am a mother, and I definitely want to be taken care of!",
        "The church can break your heart with its sin. It’s broken my heart a few times.",
        "After nearly sixty years of marriage, I can speak to this."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Depressive. She seeks the 'correct' interpretation (Compulsive) while emphasizing the necessity of communal harmony and 'mutual interdependence' (Depressive/Relationship-oriented).",
      "diaconal_quality": "High. The personal anecdotes are brief and serve the larger point of ecclesial community.",
      "strengths": [
        "Authentic admission of the church's failures.",
        "Avoids the 'Hysterical' trap of making the sermon about her own motherhood."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'I am sorry to disappoint anyone' opening carries a slight 'Schizoid' distance, a pedagogical sharpness that could be softened."

    },
    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher speaks from a position of 'Solidary Authority'. She identifies with the congregation ('We Americans', 'many of us') but also acts as a corrective guide. There is a subtle 'teaching' dominance where she corrects the 'sentimental' listener. The relationship is defined by a shared location (the foot of the cross) and a shared struggle against the 'heedless throngs' outside. The 'yellow' signal is one of invitation into a difficult community. However, there is a slight 'relationship noise' in the intellectualizing of the mother-son bond, which might feel cold to a listener seeking comfort in grief.",
      "quotes": [
        "We Americans tend to be a sentimental people.",
        "He is giving you to me and me to you.",
        "Please come back."

      "attitude_indication": "Solidary-Pedagogical; she is a fellow-sufferer in the church but also the one who knows the Greek text better.",
      "strengths": [
        "Strong sense of 'we-identity' in the face of the world.",
        "Direct, warm appeal at the conclusion."

        "The transition from the 'horror' of the cross to 'date night' studies feels like a jarring relational shift.",
        "Could acknowledge the emotional weight of the scene more before deconstructing it."

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily to 'stay' and 'belong'. The 'Anspruch' (demand) is to abandon individualism and embrace the 'interdependence' of the church. Theologically, the 'Zuspruch' (promise) is that Christ creates this family through his blood. However, the sermon leans heavily toward the 'Anspruch' of community—the listener is told they *cannot* be a Christian alone. This creates a 'pressure of duty' toward the institution. The Barthian 'Acting Subject' (God) is somewhat overshadowed by the preacher's sociological defense of the church as a necessary community. The 'red' side is more about 'joining the group' than 'resting in the finished work'.",
      "quotes": [
        "There is no other way to be a disciple of Jesus than to be in communion with other disciples.",
        "You cannot have God as your Father unless you have the Church as your mother.",
        "Please come back."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The demand for community (Anspruch) slightly outweighs the promise of grace (Zuspruch) in the middle section.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Moderate. The insistence on community can feel like a new law for the 'Appeal Ear' who is already exhausted by social obligations.",
      "strengths": [
        "Clear call to move beyond 'Jesus and me' individualism.",
        "The final appeal is rooted in being 'loved by our Lord'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'Zuspruch' of Christ's victory could be more central than the 'necessity' of the church.",
        "The use of secular 'studies' on marriage risks turning the Gospel into a 'helpful tip' for social thriving."

    "dominant_side": "Blue (Factual Content) / Red (Appeal for Community)",
    "disruptions": "The 'noise' of secular citations (Frank Stella, Journey's End) disrupts the 'healing disruption' of the cross by shifting the focus to cultural commentary.",
    "healing_disruption": "The disruption occurs when she forces the listener to look at the 'trash-strewn ground' and 'human waste' of the cross, shattering the sentimental image of Mary."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is a disciplined, intellectually rigorous piece of homiletics that successfully navigates the tension between the 'Third Word' and the broader Johannine theology. Its primary strength lies in its 'Blue' side—the exegetical dismantling of sentimentality in favor of a robust ecclesiology. The preacher avoids the 'Hysterical' trap of personal over-sharing, maintaining a 'diaconal' presence. However, the sermon suffers from an over-reliance on secular illustrations (Frank Stella, British plays, marriage studies) which, while interesting, tend to psychologize the 'Sache' and shift the focus from God as the Acting Subject (Immink) to the church as a sociological necessity. The 'Yellow' side is solidary but carries a pedagogical 'above-ness' that might alienate the 'Relationship Ear'. Theologically, it risks making the 'Church' the object of faith rather than the 'Christ' who founds it. The 'Barthian' warning is relevant here: the sermon occasionally treats the church as a human experience of community rather than a divine miracle of revelation. Nevertheless, the final appeal is moving and restores the focus to the love of the Lord.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a risk of 'ecclesiological psychologization'—defining the church by its communal benefits (e.g., marriage studies) rather than as the 'creatura verbi'.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Rigorous exegetical focus on the 'Hour'.",
      "Effective deconstruction of cultural sentimentality.",
      "Vulnerable yet professional self-revelation regarding the church's sins."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce the number of secular/cultural citations to allow the text to breathe.",
      "Strengthen the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) to ensure the 'Anspruch' (Community) doesn't feel like Law.",
      "Connect the 'interdependence' more directly to the Spirit's work than to social 'thriving'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A solid, 'Ample Satisfactory' sermon that excels in teaching but occasionally loses the 'Healing Disruption' of the Gospel in a thicket of cultural references."
