    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a masterclass in the Nurturing Parent ego state, providing deep emotional resonance and comfort. However, it maintains a high level of psychological dependency. By framing the Bible as a 'stern warning' and himself as the one 'pointing to God,' the preacher reinforces a Parent-Child dynamic that may hinder the congregation's transition to a new leader and their own spiritual Adult autonomy. The 'I shall be satisfied' refrain centers the preacher's emotional payoff as the ultimate goal of the ministry.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of Nurturing Parent to provide comfort during a difficult transition.",
      "Effective use of Adult ego to address social context (Mandela/Constitution)."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Heavy reliance on fear-based Critical Parent language regarding Scripture.",
      "Centering the preacher's satisfaction rather than the congregation's growth."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to move from 'I leave you these promises' (Parent) to 'We have discovered these truths together' (Adult). Encourage the congregation to find their own Adult relationship with the text rather than 'shuddering' in Adapted Child compliance."
