    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating sensory connections between the biblical text and contemporary life. By framing the Kingdom of Heaven as a 'party,' the preacher taps into universal human experiences of inclusion and exclusion. The imagery of the 'A list' and 'B list' provides a sharp, modern lens for the ancient parable. However, while the contemporary imagery is vivid, the biblical imagery (oxen, fat calves) is largely quoted rather than creatively 'painted' for the hearer. The strength lies in the 'showing' of social awkwardness and the 'Siberia' of the opera house, which makes the abstract concept of 'outer darkness' palpable.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Episcopal idea of a party is decidedly pinched in comparison with that of other cultures.",
        "When we arrived, we were unceremoniously escorted to a seat in Siberia, at the very back of the room.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is sophisticated yet accessible, characteristic of high-quality 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre). The preacher avoids 'Canaanite' jargon, opting for clear, descriptive English. There is a precise naming of social classes and cultural nuances (WASP, Pentecostal, working class). The precision is most evident in the self-deprecating story about the Metropolitan Opera, where the preacher admits to 'chagrin'—a nuanced emotional descriptor. The use of 'pinched' to describe an aesthetic of hospitality shows a high level of linguistic care.",
      "quotes": [
        "The misfortunes of the British royal family have taken a lot of the gloss off such weddings lately.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition to 'putting on Christ' becomes slightly more conventional and less precise than the social analysis.",
        "Some generalizations about 'good church people' could be more nuanced.",
        "The ending relies on a string of biblical quotes which, while precise, lacks the preacher's own linguistic stamp."

      "jargon_analysis": "Virtually free of unexplained jargon; 'Eucharist' and 'grace' are used in ways that are contextually clear."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a conversational, rhythmic flow that suggests it was written for the ear. There is a good use of parallelism, especially in the section describing 'a really good party.' The cadence is generally 'legato,' moving smoothly from one thought to the next. However, it lacks the 'staccato' moments of high drama or poetic intensity that would elevate it to a higher score. It feels more like an elegant essay than a rhythmic performance. The repetition of 'It isn't like...' creates a nice rhetorical build-up, but the energy levels remain somewhat plateaued.",
      "quotes": [
        "It isn't like the gala benefits... It isn't like the high school proms... It isn't like the reception...",
        "The wedding is ready, but those invited were not worthy.",
        "Everyone knows all the words of all the songs and has a partner for every dance."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of anaphora (repetition at the start of sentences) in the 'party' description.",
        "Natural, oral cadence that avoids 'paper language' stiffness.",
        "Good variation between short, punchy sentences and longer, descriptive ones."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Increase the use of alliteration or assonance to make key theological points more memorable.",
        "Create more dramatic pauses or rhythmic shifts before the 'stern language' of the parable.",
        "The conclusion is a bit wordy; a more rhythmic, percussive ending would increase impact."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Oral language; the text feels like a transcript of a living voice."
    },
    "average_score_language": 6.67,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by 'sober beauty' and precision. It avoids the trap of religious jargon by grounding theological concepts in sharp social observations. The imagery is effective, particularly when drawing from the preacher's own life or cultural context. While it lacks high-poetic intensity, it achieves a high level of 'stewardship of language' through its clarity and honesty. It is a 'witness' style of preaching (Long) that uses the micro-aesthetics of daily life to illuminate the macro-aesthetics of the Kingdom."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear thematic progression rather than a traditional 'Lowry' plot. It begins with an 'upsetting' of expectations (God loves parties), moves through the tension of the rejected invitation, and addresses the 'problem' of the wedding garment. There is a palpable movement from the 'pinched' reality of the present to the 'glory' of the future banquet. However, the 'turning point' is somewhat diffused across several anecdotes rather than being a sharp, singular event. The energy is sustained, but the resolution (putting on Christ) feels a bit more predictable than the engaging opening.",
      "quotes": [
        "God loves parties. Did you know that?",
        "Realism is not the point. The thrust of the parable lies elsewhere.",
        "Do not be fooled by the stern language of the Parable of the Rejected Invitation."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong opening that immediately challenges the hearer's perception of God.",
        "Logical flow from the 'invitation' to the 'guests' to the 'garment'.",
        "Effective use of personal failure to lower the hearer's defenses."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'wedding garment' section feels a bit like a separate appendix rather than the climax of the arc.",
        "Sharpen the conflict: the 'refusal' of the guests could be made more 'troubling' (Wilson).",
        "The transition to the 'All Saints' party is a bit abrupt."

      "plot_diagnosis": "A thematic journey that borders on a dynamic plot, but leans toward a 'teaching' structure."

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. The preacher masterfully 'reframes' (Cilliers) the biblical parable through the lens of modern social anxiety and class consciousness. By comparing the Kingdom to the 'Grand Tier' of the Opera or a 'WASP wedding,' the preacher makes the ancient text's concerns about status and worthiness immediate and uncomfortable. The integration is organic; the contemporary stories don't feel like 'pasted-on' illustrations but like genuine windows into the text's meaning. The 'strangeness' of the king's violent reaction is acknowledged but reframed as the self-exclusion of the proud.",
      "quotes": [
        "Episcopal idea of a party is decidedly pinched in comparison with that of other cultures.",
        "That’s where the snobs play polo.",
        "The wrong side of the railroad tracks right here in Canaan, Connecticut."

      "strengths": [
        "Excellent 'reframing' of the Kingdom as a party without A-lists or B-lists.",
        "Honest connection between biblical 'unworthiness' and modern 'social sets'.",
        "The use of local geography (Canaan, Bronx) grounds the text in the hearer's world."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could explore the 'violence' of the parable more deeply to avoid 'smoothing' the text too much.",
        "The connection to 'East Timor' feels a bit dated/generic compared to the specific local references.",
        "Ensure the 'grace' of the text isn't lost in the social commentary."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing; reality is seen through the lens of 'the fellowship of human foolishness'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon functions well as an 'open work of art' (Stark). By identifying as a member of the 'fellowship of human foolishness,' the preacher invites the hearer into a shared space of reflection rather than delivering a lecture from on high. The ending is an invitation to 'joy' and 'rejoicing' rather than a list of moral imperatives. While it provides an answer (putting on Christ), it leaves the 'how' of that transformation somewhat open to the hearer's own life context. It respects the 'ambivalence of existence' by acknowledging that even church parties are imperfect and tinged with loss.",
      "quotes": [
        "I tell this little story to illustrate the theme... that we are all members of the fellowship of human foolishness.",
        "Our party won’t be a perfect party.",
        "For those who have ears to hear, it is your own personal invitation to joy."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Avoids a 'moralistic straitjacket' by focusing on grace and invitation.",
        "Acknowledges the pain of loss (missing spouses) within the 'joy' of the party.",
        "The preacher's vulnerability creates an 'open' space for the hearer's own failures."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The definition of the 'wedding garment' could be even more polyvalent.",
        "The conclusion relies heavily on 'rejoice always,' which can feel a bit 'closed' if not careful.",
        "Could leave more room for the 'speechless' guest's perspective."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Polyvalent; it allows for multiple entries through social, personal, and theological doors."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is robust, primarily due to the seamless integration of text and context. The preacher avoids a static 'three-point' sermon in favor of a thematic movement that feels like a journey. The 'reframing' of the Kingdom as a party without a 'pecking order' is a powerful dramaturgical move. While the narrative arc could be tightened in the final third, the sermon successfully creates an 'open' space where the hearer is invited to participate in the 'joy' of the gospel rather than simply obey a command."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully avoids religious kitsch. It does not offer 'immediate comfort' without acknowledging the 'pain of suffering.' By admitting to her own 'chagrin' at the opera, the preacher avoids the 'pretense of feelings' and instead offers authentic human emotion. The 'happy ending' of the eternal banquet is tempered by the reality of 'lost spouses' and 'rat-infested tenements.' It sustains the tension between the 'already' and the 'not yet.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential kitsch of 'God loves parties' is immediately grounded by the harsh reality of the parable's ending.",
      "The 'wedding garment' could have been treated as a 'magic' solution, but is instead linked to the 'risk' of being made new."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission of not enjoying the opera because of a 'bad table' is a moment of profound aesthetic honesty.",
      "Acknowledging that even the best church parties have 'something wrong with them'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of self-deprecating honesty; it is the best antidote to the 'kitsch' of the perfect Christian life."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens a significant 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers). It frames the invitation as 'sheer grace' and emphasizes that God provides the 'garment.' It resists the urge to turn the 'wedding garment' into a list of 'good works,' instead defining it as 'putting on Christ.' The mystery of God's 'no respecter of persons' is allowed to 'cut both ways,' creating space for the holy to disrupt our social categories.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'stern language' of judgment and the 'unimaginable declaration of grace' is held until the end.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'wedding garment' remains a somewhat mysterious 'putting on' of a person (Christ) rather than a fully explained set of rules.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the ethical 'putting on Christ' is framed as a response to an invitation, not a prerequisite for it.",
    "recommendation": "To create even more space, the preacher could dwell longer on the 'speechlessness' of the guest, allowing that silence to speak to the mystery of our own unworthiness."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'reframing' and 'stewardship of language.' Its primary power lies in its ability to translate the ancient, often-violent imagery of Matthew's parable into the recognizable social anxieties of a modern, upper-middle-class congregation. By doing so, it avoids the 'kitsch' of easy piety and instead invites the hearer into a 'fellowship of human foolishness' that is nevertheless invited to a divine feast. The preacher's use of personal anecdote is not merely illustrative but performative—it models the very 'un-dressing' of pride that the text requires. While the musicality of the prose is more 'sober-Reformed' than 'poetic-imagistic,' the precision of the language and the integrity of the structure create a compelling 'open work of art.' The sermon successfully sustains the tension between the 'outer darkness' of self-exclusion and the 'brilliant light' of God's grace, ultimately leaving the hearer with an invitation rather than a demand.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the Kingdom of Heaven through modern social and cultural metaphors.",
      "Authentic, non-kitsch self-disclosure that builds a bridge of 'human foolishness' between preacher and hearer.",
      "Precise stewardship of language that avoids jargon and honors the nuance of human experience."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Strengthen the rhythmic and musical qualities of the prose to move beyond 'elegant essay' to 'oral event'.",
      "Deepen the sensory 'painting' of the biblical imagery to match the vividness of the contemporary stories.",
      "Tighten the narrative arc in the final third to ensure the 'wedding garment' feels like a dramatic climax."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reframed (combining Reformed precision with Cilliers' reframing)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (reframing/anti-kitsch) and Thomas Long (preacher as witness).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to educated, socially-aware hearers who value intellectual honesty and cultural relevance.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'staccato' rhythms during moments of theological proclamation.",
      "Try 'showing' a biblical scene with the same level of detail used for the Metropolitan Opera story.",
      "End with a more 'open' image or question to let the 'space for grace' linger longer."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically 'good to strong' sermon (7.2) that excels in the 'aesthetic turn' by valuing the human factor and the power of metaphor. It avoids the 'vertical' coldness of dialectical theology while also shunning the 'horizontal' shallowness of moralism. It is a well-crafted 'event' that uses the 'sober beauty' of honest speech to open a space for the Holy."
