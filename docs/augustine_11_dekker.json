      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The text fails Dekker's primary formal requirement. It is not an exposition of one specific pericope but a thematic meditation or 'speech about the Spirit.' It uses Scripture as a mosaic of proof-texts rather than allowing a single passage to dictate the sermon's unique logic. There is no 'starting point' found nowhere else in the Bible.",
      "quotes": [
        "I remember, though, how your grace once sufficed to turn an adulterous murderer into a psalmist...",
        "Stay with us; for, unless you do, it will grow late [cf. Lk 24:29]",

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 1,
      "findings": "There is no historical-critical or grammatical-historical exegesis. The original context of the quoted verses is ignored in favor of an immediate spiritualized application. The preacher does not engage with the Hebrew or Greek background or the specific theology of a biblical book.",
      "quotes": [
        "Return to the house of the wretched Martha whom I have become",
        "under your influence, Peter the apostate wept tears of repentance"

    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "While the sermon is psychologically intense, the application remains largely general and internal. It lacks the 'broad knowledge of the humanities' or engagement with the 'zeitgeist' Dekker demands. It focuses on the 'soul' in an abstract sense rather than the hearer's concrete world (politics, society, media).",
      "quotes": [
        "remove the swelling of my pride, clear the rot of my anger",
        "preserve us from any attachment to worldly goods"

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Because there is no sustained exposition of a text, there can be no true interwovenness. The sermon is a continuous stream of application/prayer. The 'present of revelation' where the written Word becomes the proclaimed Word is hindered by the lack of a stable scriptural foundation.",
      "quotes": [
        "speak to yourself for me and listen to yourself within me"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Structure the sermon so that the discovery of the text's meaning (exposition) simultaneously 'expounds' the hearer's life (application)."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is the sermon's strongest point. The movement from misery (sin, corruption, 'torn sack') to redemption (mercy, the Spirit's work) and gratitude (consecration, following Christ) is clearly the background logic. It avoids being 'too objective' by making man the subject of the struggle.",
      "quotes": [
        "See how poor I am, how dire my needs",
        "if you save us, it is not because we have performed righteous deeds, but because you are merciful",
        "consecrate all your powers to him"

    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon takes the possibility of being lost seriously, both temporally (living apart from God) and eternally (damnation). It avoids the 'liberal' trap of safety, though it leans heavily on the individual/internal side of the 'two ways'.",
      "quotes": [
        "one instance you manifest your mercy, and in the other your justice",
        "lest I someday fall asleep in death and my enemy boast, 'I have prevailed!'"

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the goal and the source of mercy, but the sermon is primarily Pneumatocentric. While Dekker allows for Trinitarian focus, the specific 'telos' of Christ as the 'one Lord' is occasionally obscured by the focus on the Spirit's internal operations.",
      "quotes": [
        "rejoice in the glory of Christ",
        "it is Christ who is his life [implied by the focus on grace outside self]"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly ground the Spirit's work in the objective work of Christ (the two natures) to ensure grace is seen as 'salvation outside himself'."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1450 words, the sermon likely lasts 14-15 minutes. According to Thesis 8, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for 'depth'. It lacks the substantive weight Dekker expects from a full ministry of the Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "N/A"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the sermon to at least 20 minutes by deepening the formal exposition of a specific Bible passage."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text fails the fundamental formal definition of a sermon as 'exposition and application of a specific Bible passage.' It is a thematic prayer or spiritual meditation that uses Scripture as a decorative resource rather than a foundational authority. While it strongly reflects the 'three parts' (misery, redemption, gratitude) and takes the 'two ways' seriously, it lacks the necessary exegetical depth, contemporary concreteness, and required length (20+ minutes).",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong psychological awareness of 'misery' and the human condition before God.",
      "Clear emphasis on the necessity of grace and the sovereignty of God's mercy.",
      "Serious treatment of the 'two ways' and the possibility of being lost."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of a single, specific biblical pericope as the starting point.",
      "Total absence of historical-critical or linguistic exegesis.",
      "Insufficient length to achieve the 'breadth' required for theological depth.",
      "Application remains overly internal/mystical, lacking cultural and societal specificity."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "According to Dekker's theses, this is not a sermon. It is a spiritual speech or a 'prayer to the Holy Spirit' that lacks the formal requirements of specific scriptural exposition and the necessary breadth of application to the contemporary world."
