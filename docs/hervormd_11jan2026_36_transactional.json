  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically heavy, characterized by a strong Parent-Child dynamic. While the preacher intends to be encouraging, the frequent use of 'must' and the prescriptive nature of the 'surrender' he demands creates a climate of pressure. The use of the ITHY game suggests a dynamic where the preacher's help actually reinforces the listener's dependency and sense of failure. The 'Adult' ego state is neglected, leaving little room for the listener to integrate the message through their own reality-testing.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of vivid metaphors (the stairs, the current).",
      "Clear attempt to connect ancient text to contemporary experience."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on the Critical Parent ('must', 'should').",
      "Prescribing emotional responses (how to feel, how to pray) which stifles the Free Child."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Shift from 'You must' to 'I invite you to consider.' Engage the Adult ego state by asking open-ended questions that allow the listener to process their own experience without a pre-determined 'correct' answer. Reduce the psychological pressure of the 'payoff' by allowing the gospel to be a gift rather than a performance-based requirement."
