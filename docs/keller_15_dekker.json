By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. [...] His love in time past forbids me to think He’ll leave me at last In trouble to sink … By prayer let me wrestle Then he will perform With Christ in my vessel I smile at the storm."

    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon identifies a specific pericope but struggles to isolate what is unique to *this* text compared to other 'walking on water' accounts. It relies heavily on the preceding feeding of the 5,000 to explain the context, which is good, but the 'nowhere else' factor is weak as much of the content is general Christology.",
      "quotes": [
        "The key to understanding the meaning of this whole incident … is to read the two verses right before this particular account.",
        "This miracle needs to be brought together with the bread miracle... because only together does the message come forward."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more on the specific Johannine vocabulary (e.g., the 'immediately' reaching the shore in v. 21) rather than harmonizing with Mark and Matthew."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates the required linguistic and historical knowledge. The distinction between 'treading' and 'strolling' (peripateō) is used effectively to establish the theological point of divine sovereignty. The connection to the 'I Am' (ego eimi) and the Old Testament (Job/Psalms) is exegetically sound.",
      "quotes": [
        "In Greek there are a number of different words... the word that’s actually used there is a word that means to amble or to stroll.",
        "He doesn’t say, 'It is I.' He says ego eimi. He says, 'I am.' He uses a Greek construction that is extremely unusual."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid relying on other gospels (Mark/Matthew) to fill in 'details'; Dekker demands the exposition of *this* specific text's unique witness."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application is somewhat concrete regarding the 'prosperity gospel' and political reductionism, but it often falls back into general categories of suffering (bereavement, illness). The 'missionary girl' illustration is effective but borders on a general moral lesson about 'using God'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let me just give you four: bereavement, illness, relational betrayal, and financial disaster.",
        "You can’t reduce Christianity to a political program that is put into place by coercion."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'zeitgeist' analysis sharper. Instead of general 'suffering,' address how modern secular self-reliance specifically clashes with the 'uncontrollable force' of Christ."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a thematic structure (Force, Counsel, Salvation) which allows for some mixing, but it still feels like a lecture where a point of exegesis is followed by a block of application. The 'drawing in' of the hearer is present but structured.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let’s think about what that means practically. That’s the principle. How does that apply?",
        "If you put the first two points of the sermon together... think of how that can comfort you."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the 'Principle -> Application' formula. Let the exposition of the Greek text itself be the moment the hearer feels 'expounded' or judged."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon strongly emphasizes misery (alienation from God, hostility, the 'storm' of justice) and redemption (Christ as the ultimate Jonah). Gratitude is the implied conclusion (the hymn), though it is less developed than the first two parts.",
      "quotes": [
        "Your most fundamental problem is you’re alienated from God. You’re hostile to God.",
        "He bowed his head into the storm of divine justice and wrath on our sin so we could have peace."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The 'gratitude' section is a bit sentimental (the hymn). It should be more robustly connected to the 'new agenda' mentioned earlier."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on being 'lost'—specifically the 'hostility' toward God and the danger of 'using' Him. It takes the hearer's life design seriously, though the 'eternal loss' aspect is more implicit than explicit.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you ever serve God conditionally... the condition is the real god. It’s the real thing you’re living for.",
        "The reason he can save us from these storms... eventually, he’s going to end all storms."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly address the 'two ways' as a choice of destination. The sermon is slightly too 'comfort-oriented' toward the end, softening the edge of the 'uncontrollable force'."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "This is the sermon's strongest point. Christ is clearly the telos and is identified as God (two natures). The move from the 'I Am' of terror to the 'I Am' of grace is a strong dogmatic movement that fits Dekker's criteria.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus isn’t just the ultimate Moses; he’s the God of Moses.",
        "God’s infinite glory and power is now for them, not against them. How do we explain this?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'grace' doesn't become a 'general truth' but remains tied to the specific 'boat' context of John 6."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At approximately 28 minutes, the sermon allows for the 'breadth' Miskotte and Dekker demand. It moves beyond a simple 'Jesus helps us' message into deeper Trinitarian and Christological waters.",
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this length but reduce the 'harmonization' with other gospels to allow for even deeper focus on John's specific theology."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong theological exposition that largely aligns with Dekker's criteria, particularly in its Christocentric focus and use of original languages. However, it occasionally slips into 'general truths' regarding suffering and relies too heavily on harmonizing with other gospels rather than mining the unique depths of the Johannine text. The application is clear but sometimes lacks the 'sharpness' of a specific cultural critique.",
    "strengths": [
      "High Christological focus (Christ as the 'I Am' and God of Moses).",
      "Adequate length allowing for theological depth.",
      "Effective use of Greek (peripateō) to drive the theological point of sovereignty."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Tendency to harmonize with Mark/Matthew instead of focusing on John's specific 'nowhere else' contribution.",
      "Application to 'suffering' is somewhat generic (bereavement, illness).",
      "The 'two ways' (seriousness of being lost) could be more sharply articulated."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate and strong sermon according to Dekker's definition. It treats the Bible as the Word of God, maintains the necessity of academic exegesis, and keeps Christ as the telos. It avoids the 'bicycle mechanic' trap by properly mounting the wheel of the Gospel through the lens of the 'I Am'."
