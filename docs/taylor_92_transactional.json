    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a masterclass in psychologically healthy homiletics. It utilizes the Adult ego state to handle administrative and political realities while invoking the Nurturing Parent to provide a safe space for mourning. Most significantly, it validates the Free Child of the Black experience—celebrating its rhythm, rapture, and resilience—without falling into the trap of 'Adapted Child' compliance to white or traditionalist structures. It avoids manipulative games by maintaining transparency and promoting the autonomy of the listeners.",
    "strengths": [
      "High Adult presence regarding convention business and social analysis.",
      "Validation of the 'Free Child' as a source of spiritual power.",
      "Avoidance of the Drama Triangle by empowering the 'Victim'."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from administrative reports (Adult) to the 'Power of Blackness' (FC) is slightly abrupt.",
      "The use of 'must' in the mission section could lean toward CP if not balanced by the preceding empowerment."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to address the congregation as 'Comrades' and 'Partners'; this reinforces the Adult-Adult contract and prevents the development of dependency-based games like ITHY."
