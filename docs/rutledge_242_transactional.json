  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a remarkably healthy example of Adult-to-Adult communication. It avoids the typical traps of wartime preaching (NIGYSOB or Ain't It Awful) by maintaining a high level of reality-testing and self-awareness. The preacher resists the urge to play the 'Rescuer' who has all the political answers, instead inviting the congregation into a shared space of 'wrestling' and 'awe.' The psychological impact is one of liberation and responsibility rather than guilt or dependency.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of the Adult ego state to process current events.",
      "Deconstruction of tribal 'Parent' scripts (nationalism).",
      "Inclusion of the self in the critique, preventing the Drama Triangle."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the 'foreigner in the church' anecdote is slightly abrupt and could be perceived as a mild 'Parental' correction.",
      "The ending hymn 'America the Beautiful' risks re-triggering the 'Adapted Child' nationalistic script that the sermon worked to deconstruct."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'we' pronoun to maintain a level playing field. To further avoid 'ITHY' (I'm Only Trying To Help You), ensure that the 'happy knowledge' of grace is presented as a discovery for the preacher as much as for the listener."
