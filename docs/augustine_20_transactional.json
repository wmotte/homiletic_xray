    "summary": "This sermon is a textbook example of a Critical Parent addressing an Adapted Child. It utilizes shame, medical gaslighting (calling illnesses imaginary), and fear-based motivation. It creates a 'no-win' situation where the listener's physical needs are dismissed as moral failings. The psychological impact is the reinforcement of a 'You're Not OK' life position for the congregation, fostering dependency on the preacher's 'prescriptions' rather than spiritual autonomy.",

      "Over-reliance on shame as a motivational tool.",
      "Absence of the Adult ego state to discuss the 'why' of fasting beyond fear."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as Adult peers. Instead of 'You are lazy,' try 'We often find it difficult to discipline our bodies; let's explore how we can support one another.' Move from 'Fast for fear' to 'Fast for the joy of spiritual focus.'"
