    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of Parent-Child homiletics. While it begins with an Adult-oriented reflection on the human condition, it quickly devolves into a game of 'Bait & Switch.' It uses the universal trauma of death to bypass the listener's Adult ego and trigger the Adapted Child's fear and guilt. By discrediting reason ('minds play tricks'), the preacher ensures the listener cannot achieve autonomy and must rely on the 'keys' held by the religious authority. The shaming of 'lax' attendees further reinforces a Critical Parent dynamic that undermines the purported message of 'Faith Beyond Fear.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of imagery to connect with the Free Child's emotions.",
      "Effective identification of a universal human 'gimmick' (fear of death)."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "High level of coercive 'Critical Parent' language.",
      "Systematic undermining of the listener's 'Adult' ego (reason/logic)."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Address the congregation as Adult subjects capable of processing grief and hope. Instead of shaming 'lax' attendance, explore the 'Here-and-Now' value of community. Move from being a 'Rescuer' who holds the keys to a 'Fellow Traveler' who shares the Adult reality of faith."
