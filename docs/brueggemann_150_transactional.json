It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, using historical and scriptural data to challenge the listener's perception of power. By identifying Jesus as a 'dangerous' truth-teller rather than a passive victim, it invites the congregation into a state of 'Free Child' imagination and 'Adult' responsibility. It avoids the 'Redemption Bait & Switch' by maintaining a consistent focus on the cost of truth-telling.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'open ending' technique; it is the ultimate antidote to the Drama Triangle as it refuses the role of Rescuer."
