  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon centers on Exodus 3, specifically the burning bush and the divine name. It attempts to actualize the text by contrasting it with modern atheism. However, it leans heavily on the 'idea' of revelation versus 'religion' rather than the absolute particularity of this specific pericope's unique contribution to the canon.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have just read the Biblical story of the event in Moses’ life that introduces the God of Israel by name for the first time.",
        "The burning bush is an ineffable symbol of 'the transcendent, awesome, and unapproachable Divine Presence'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify what Exodus 3:14 says that cannot be found in any other 'I AM' statement or theophany in Scripture. Move beyond the general 'God vs. Projection' theme."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher shows awareness of the historical-critical context (Egyptian influence, demographics) but relies more on secondary literature (Cahill, Freud) than on primary linguistic or exegetical depth. The mention of the divine name's meaning is 'much disputed' but not deeply explored through Hebrew scholarship.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Biblical atmosphere of worldly reality is a radical departure from that of Near Eastern religion.",
        "The proper interpretation of the divine name, much disputed, means one thing for sure..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate more direct engagement with the Hebrew text and the specific theological history of the Sinai/Horeb tradition rather than relying on modern popular-theological authors."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is sharp and culturally relevant, specifically targeting the 'Harvard' zeitgeist and the intellectual elite. It avoids general 'be good' platitudes by engaging with specific thinkers like Rorty and Rushdie. It is concrete in its intellectual context.",
      "quotes": [
        "In Cambridge, where I work, religiosity is accounted one of those conditions that suggest some lapse of hygiene...",
        "God is out there on the barricades with disreputable people like Moses and Paul and, who knows, maybe even Al Sharpton."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "While the intellectual application is strong, the ethical application (liberation) remains somewhat abstract. Connect the 'revolution' more concretely to the congregation's life."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon moves back and forth between Freud (application/context) and Moses (exposition). However, the first third is almost entirely cultural commentary, creating a slight delay in the 'movement' where the hearer is drawn into the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "So, feeling myself in good company... I propose to call in the big guns and match them up: Moses and Freud.",
        "Now Freud would say that all of this is nothing more than a projection... Okay, but let us suspend disbelief for a moment."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Begin the exposition of the text earlier so that the critique of Freud emerges from the text itself rather than the text being a 'response' to Freud."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is defined here as 'helplessness' and 'illusion' (intellectual misery). Redemption is the 'God who comes down.' Gratitude is less explicit, framed as 'participation.' The psychological depth Dekker calls for is present via Freud, but the 'misery before God' is somewhat intellectualized.",
      "quotes": [
        "[Religious ideas are] born from man’s need to make his helplessness tolerable.",
        "While we were still helpless, Christ died for the ungodly."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect beyond intellectual illusion to the existential and spiritual 'lostness' that Dekker emphasizes."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on the seriousness of life ('sentenced to death'), but the 'two ways' (destruction vs. life) are not the driving force. The choice is framed more as 'illusion vs. reality' than a life-and-death decision regarding one's destination.",
      "quotes": [
        "...the God who allows human beings to be inhuman, who has sentenced us all to death.",
        "an invitation to trust, a commission to follow, a summons to participate..."

      "improvement_point": "Make the consequences of the 'human choice' more explicit. What is lost if the 'revolution' is ignored?"

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos. The sermon successfully moves from the burning bush to the Cross, presenting Christ as the ultimate 'un-religion.' It upholds the 'outside ourselves' nature of salvation.",
      "quotes": [
        "This 'subversive narrative' comes to its climax two thousand years later on a hill outside Jerusalem...",
        "Man has no life in himself, it is Christ who is his life. [Paraphrased context]"

      "improvement_point": "Ensure the transition from the Old Testament name (YHWH) to Christ is rooted in the text's specific logic rather than a dogmatic jump."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At approximately 2150 words, the sermon meets Dekker's requirement of >20 minutes. It allows for the 'breadth' required for intellectual depth.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this breadth but ensure it serves the text's specificity more than the cultural dialogue."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily in its reliance on secondary cultural dialogue (Freud/Cahill) over primary exegetical specificity. It functions more as a 'theological speech' responding to atheism than a strict 'recreation of the Bible passage into a new word.' However, it is strong in its refusal of 'general truths' and its concrete engagement with the zeitgeist.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application to a specific intellectual audience (Harvard/Cambridge).",
      "Strong Christocentric telos that avoids moralism.",
      "Adequate length to allow for theological complexity."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Exegesis is secondary to cultural polemics.",
      "The 'two ways' and the seriousness of being lost are under-thematized.",
      "Heavy reliance on quoting other authors (Woolf, Rorty, Cahill) risks burying the specific voice of the Exodus text."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a substantial sermon that meets the formal length and Christocentric requirements, but it risks becoming a 'speech about the gospel' rather than an 'exposition of THIS text.' It is a 6/10: adequate and serious, but needs more primary exegetical grit."
