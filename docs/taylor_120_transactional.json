    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of Parent-Child dynamics. While it addresses important social issues (racism, secularism) from a position of moral courage, it utilizes psychological pressure (fear-based urgency) to bypass the listener's Adult ego. The 'payoff' is a cathartic release of guilt, which creates a cycle of dependency on the preacher's 'Parental' authority for emotional stability.",
