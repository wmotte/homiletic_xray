    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically supportive and largely avoids toxic 'shame-based' games. It operates primarily from a Nurturing Parent position, seeking to provide a sense of security and identity to a marginalized group (specifically addressing the Black experience of discrimination). However, it flirts with creating a 'dependency' by devaluing human agency ('your fate is in bad hands') immediately after asserting it.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The contradiction between 'it is in your hands' and 'you are in bad hands' can cause cognitive dissonance.",
      "Over-reliance on the 'Victim' role for the congregation in the Drama Triangle."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to balance the Nurturing Parent with more Adult-to-Adult transactions. Instead of saying 'your fate is in bad hands,' ask the congregation to reflect on their own experiences of agency and how faith empowers that agency, rather than replacing it."
