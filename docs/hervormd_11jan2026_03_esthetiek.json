    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily through the biblical narrative itself rather than original poetic expansion. While it mentions the 'stench' of isolation and the 'rustle' of the crowd, it relies heavily on explaining the text rather than 'painting' it. The imagery of the 'hem of the garment' is treated more as a theological locus than a sensory experience. There is a missed opportunity to vividly describe the physical sensation of the 'fountain of blood' drying up or the tactile reality of the crowd's pressure. The use of the 'umbrella of peace' at the end is a rare contemporary metaphor, but it feels somewhat detached from the biblical world. According to Paul Scott Wilson's 'show, don't tell', this sermon leans heavily toward 'telling' the theological significance of the images rather than letting the images speak for themselves.",

    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is characteristic of the 'Canaanite' dialect—traditional Reformed jargon (e.g., 'vrijspraak', 'gerechtvaardigd', 'ongerechtigheden'). While precise within its dogmatic framework, it lacks the 'stewardship of language' McEntyre advocates for in a broader cultural sense. The preacher is careful to define terms like 'Shalom' and 'Jezus', showing a desire for clarity. However, the repetition of 'eigenlijk', 'natuurlijk', and 'zoals ik al zei' indicates a somewhat loose oral style that lacks the lapidary precision of a truly aesthetic text. The distinction between 'sentiment' and 'emotion' is maintained by grounding feelings in the biblical text, avoiding excessive emotionalism.",

        "Zonde maakt een mens onrein. Anti-God is zonde.",

      "jargon_analysis": "High use of traditional religious jargon. It is mostly appropriate for the target audience but risks being 'sealed shut' to outsiders."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a predictable, rhythmic flow typical of extemporaneous preaching based on notes. There is a frequent use of short, staccato sentences which creates urgency but can become monotonous. The use of parallelism (e.g., 'Geloof dat Jezus nodig heeft... aanraakt... openbaart') provides a structural rhythm, but the sentence-level musicality is limited. It feels like 'spoken prose' rather than 'poetic proclamation'. The preacher uses rhetorical questions effectively to create a pulse in the delivery, but the overall cadence lacks the 'legato' of a truly musical aesthetic.",
      "quotes": [
        "Geloof dat Jezus nodig heeft. Vervolgens: geloof dat Jezus aanraakt.",
        "Eén aanraking en terstond. Ben je gezond? Ben je geheeld? Zijn je zonden weg?",

    },
    "average_score_language": 5.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is functional and deeply rooted in the Reformed tradition. It excels in clarity and traditional precision but lacks poetic 'surplus'. The imagery is largely derivative of the biblical text, and the rhythm is predictable. While it avoids the dryness of 'paper language', it does not reach the level of 'stewardship of language' that transforms the sermon into a work of art. It is a solid, communicative tool that prioritizes dogmatic correctness over aesthetic innovation."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a classic 'Lowry Loop' to some extent: it starts with the 'upsetting of equilibrium' (the woman's 12-year suffering) and moves toward a resolution. However, the three-point structure ('nodig heeft', 'aanraakt', 'bevestigt') acts as a static frame that occasionally interrupts the narrative flow. The 'turning point' is clearly identified in the touch, but the preacher spends significant time on theological digressions (e.g., election, 'bad doctors') which slows the momentum. The inclusion of Jairus at the end provides a nice dramaturgical 'bookend' that respects the biblical structure.",
      "quotes": [
        "En dan heb je dan deze geschiedenis daartussen van de vrouw met bloedvloeiing die genezen wordt.",
        "Maar, daar komt verandering in. Haar oren zijn open gegaan.",
        "We sluiten de preek af, gemeente, door elkaar een vraag te stellen en die te beantwoorden."

      "strengths": [
        "Strong opening that establishes the 'trouble' (sin and suffering) effectively.",
        "Good 'inter-weaving' of the Jairus story to maintain the biblical context's tension.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "Integrate theological 'asides' (like the discussion on election) more organically into the narrative arc.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The integration is one of the sermon's stronger points. The preacher successfully 'reframes' the biblical concept of isolation through the lens of the Covid-19 pandemic, making the woman's plight relatable to a modern audience. He also connects the 'doctors' of the text to modern spiritual 'doctors' (legalistic advice). The 'reframing' (Cilliers) occurs when the woman's physical uncleanness is mirrored in the hearer's spiritual state, though the transition sometimes feels a bit forced through the 'sin-cause' logic. The sermon successfully moves between 'then' and 'now'.",
      "quotes": [
        "We weten misschien nog een beetje wat... van Covid. Als je dan positief bevonden was, dan moest je in isolement.",
        "En dan heb je ook nog van die artsen... die dan tegen je zeggen: 'Je moet meer bidden, hoor.'",
        "Op een bepaalde manier kunnen we ons allemaal een beetje identificeren met deze vrouw."

      "strengths": [
        "The Covid analogy is a powerful 'reframing' tool for understanding 'uncleanness'.",
        "The connection between physical healing and spiritual justification is clearly articulated.",
        "Respects the 'strangeness' of the Levitical laws while making them applicable."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Deepen the 'reframing' by exploring the aesthetic of 'grace' as more than just a legal transaction.",
        "Address modern 'uncleanness' (shame, social media exclusion) beyond just the Covid example.",
        "Ensure the transition from the biblical 'then' to the contemporary 'now' is less abrupt."

      "reframing_present": "Yes, primarily through the analogy of isolation and the critique of modern 'legalistic' healers."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is quite 'closed' in the sense of Ciska Stark's 'Opera Aperta'. It functions as a closed system of Reformed truths where every question is answered and every tension resolved. The preacher uses 'we must' and 'it is' frequently, leaving little room for the hearer's own interpretation or the 'ambivalence of existence'. The ending is prescriptive rather than invitational. While it offers comfort, it does so by 'sealing' the meaning of the text within a specific dogmatic framework, leaving little space for the 'mystery' of why some are not healed.",
      "quotes": [
        "En dat leidt me tot de laatste hindernis. Dat is de grootste en de ergste: ongeloof.",
        "In wezen is het allemaal hetzelfde: het is Jezus als het ware omhelzen.",
        "Waarom wil Jezus nou juist dat deze vrouw openbaar zou komen...? Ik geef er een paar, paar gedachtes."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Provides high certainty and 'consolatio' (comfort) for the believer.",
        "Clear, unambiguous proclamation of the Gospel.",
        "The use of Luther's quote provides a strong, albeit closed, theological anchor."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Leave some questions unanswered to allow the 'Holy to happen' (Immink) in the hearer's space.",
        "Reduce the 'explanatory' tone ('I will give you three reasons why...') and use more evocative language.",
        "Acknowledge the 'not yet'—those who touch the hem and are not physically healed—to respect existential ambivalence."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Closed/Monovalent. The sermon acts as a didactic explanation of truth rather than an open work of art."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 5.67,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is a traditional Reformed homiletical plot. It successfully bridges text and context through the 'isolation' motif but remains tethered to a didactic, three-point framework. This provides clarity but limits the 'aesthetic event' by closing off mystery and polyvalence. The movement is logical and leads to a clear conclusion, but it lacks the 'openness' required for a truly modern aesthetic experience. It is a 'witness' (Long) that leans heavily toward being a 'teacher'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids religious kitsch by taking the 'pain of suffering' seriously. By describing the 12 years of 'getob' (toiling) and the failure of other doctors, the preacher avoids a 'cheap happy ending'. However, there is a slight tendency toward 'kitsch' in the rapid transition from sin to grace without dwelling in the 'lament'. The use of the 'umbrella' metaphor is borderline kitsch as it simplifies the complex peace of God into a cozy image. Overall, the depth of the theological struggle (the fear and trembling of the woman) preserves the sermon's authenticity.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'umbrella of peace' metaphor (simplistic/cozy).",
      "The somewhat 'happy' resolution of Jairus's tension without acknowledging the agonizing wait."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the woman's financial and physical exhaustion ('al haar geld eraan uitgegeven').",
      "The acknowledgement of 'geestelijke verlatenheid' (spiritual desertion) in the application."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Avoid 'cozy' metaphors like umbrellas; instead, use the biblical imagery of 'Shalom' as a hard-won, cosmic restoration."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace through the insistence that the healing is 'gratis' and that Jesus is 'benaderbaar' (accessible). Cilliers' 'Space for Grace' is present in the emphasis on Christ's blood flowing for the woman's. However, the space is partially closed by the heavy moralizing at the end ('Niemand heeft het recht... om bij Jezus weg te blijven') and the rigid 'sin-causes-sickness' logic, which can feel like a 'dogmatic ceiling' for those suffering under the mystery of providence.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are mostly resolved; the 'already' of healing is emphasized over the 'not yet' of continued suffering.",
    "mystery_respected": "Moderate. The mechanics of faith are explained thoroughly, which somewhat diminishes the mystery of the encounter.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the description of the gift, but moralization creeps into the 'call to action'.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'fear and trembling' of the woman to stand longer as a valid space of encounter before moving to the 'daughter' resolution."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 5.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically 'sober-Reformed' work. It prioritizes the 'Fides ex auditu' (faith from hearing) through clear, didactic proclamation. Its greatest aesthetic strength lies in its 'reframing' of biblical isolation through the contemporary experience of Covid-19, which creates a genuine bridge for the hearer. However, it suffers from a lack of poetic 'surplus' and a structural closedness that treats the sermon more as a theological lecture than an 'open work of art'. The language is functional but lacks the musicality and precision that would elevate it to a higher aesthetic level. It successfully avoids the worst forms of religious kitsch by grounding its comfort in the 'blood of Christ' and the reality of suffering, but it often 'tells' the Gospel rather than 'showing' it.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Effective 'reframing' of the woman's isolation through the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Authentic naming of human suffering and the failure of 'worldly' solutions.",
      "Clear Christocentric focus that grounds healing in the substitutionary work of Christ."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase 'showing' over 'telling' by using more sensory, evocative language in the narrative.",
      "Open the structure to allow for more mystery and the hearer's own 'appropriation'.",
      "Refine the 'stewardship of language' by reducing filler words and refreshing traditional jargon."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Didactic-Narrative",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Thomas Long (Preacher as Witness) and Paul Scott Wilson (Four Pages structure), but lacks the 'Openness' of Ciska Stark.",
    "audience_analysis": "Traditional Reformed hearers who value theological clarity, biblical fidelity, and 'consolatio' within a known dogmatic framework.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' or a rhetorical question to let the message resonate longer.",
      "Use one central, original metaphor throughout the sermon instead of multiple traditional ones.",
      "Read the text aloud during preparation to identify and remove 'paper language' and filler words."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a solid example of practical-theological preaching that fulfills its liturgical purpose but remains aesthetically modest. It provides a 'space for grace' within a traditional frame, offering comfort to the weary. To move from a 6 to an 8, the preacher would need to embrace the 'aesthetic turn' more fully—viewing the sermon not just as a delivery vehicle for truth, but as a sensory, rhythmic, and open encounter with the Holy."
