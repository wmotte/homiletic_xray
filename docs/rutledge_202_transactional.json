    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Redemptive Manipulation.' It uses high-quality Nurturing Parent language to create a safe space, only to pivot to a Critical Parent demand that the listener adopt a 'no health in us' identity. This creates a psychological dependency where the 'joy' of the gospel is only accessible through a state of self-abasement. While theologically traditional, it risks reinforcing a 'I'm Not OK - You're OK (God/Preacher)' life script.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of empathy and relatable human metaphors.",
      "High degree of Nurturing Parent warmth which can provide genuine comfort."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on the 'miserable offender' trope which crushes the Adult ego.",
      "Creating a 'contingent' grace that requires a specific psychological breakdown to be valid."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as 'Adults' who are capable of choosing the good, rather than 'Children' who are inherently self-destructive. Replace 'must' and 'no health' with observations of the 'here-and-now' reality of human struggle and potential."
