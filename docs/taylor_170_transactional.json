        "presence_of_adaptation": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher models a 'Free Child' vulnerability by sharing personal grief, which prevents the congregation from feeling forced into a fearful Adapted Child role.",

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The preacher avoids NIGYSOB by not looking for sins to punish. He avoids ITHY by not offering a 'quick fix' but rather a shared hope. The 'Ain't It Awful' game is avoided because the focus is on life/resurrection rather than just complaining about the world's evil."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably healthy. It avoids the common trap of using the pulpit to dominate the listener's ego. Instead, it utilizes a strong Adult ego state to process the reality of mortality and an authentic Nurturing Parent state to provide communal comfort. By sharing a personal story of a friend’s decline, the preacher moves out of a 'superior' position and into a shared human experience, fostering autonomy and authentic reflection in the listener.",
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of Adult ego state through historical/cultural references.",
      "Authentic vulnerability (Free Child) in the story of Marshall Shepard.",
      "Avoidance of 'must/should' language in favor of 'we' and 'us'."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from 'universal rumor' to 'confirmed fact' is a leap that bypasses the Adult state.",
      "Slightly more 'Critical Parent' energy toward 'smart souls' could be softened to maintain Adult-Adult dialogue."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'we' perspective. To remain entirely game-free, ensure that the 'confirmation' of the rumor is presented as a personal/faith conviction for the listener to weigh, rather than a dogmatic 'must' that shuts down the Adult's processing."
