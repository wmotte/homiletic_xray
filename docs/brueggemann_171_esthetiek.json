    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating a central spatial metaphor—the 'house of deep shalom'—which provides a consistent visual anchor. The preacher uses sensory and evocative language to contrast the 'breathless effort' of human pursuit with the 'stately fugue' of God's eternity. There is a strong cinematic quality when describing the mountains taking form. However, the imagery becomes slightly more abstract in the second half, shifting from the 'safe house' to socio-political categories. While the 'nurse tenderly caring' image from Paul is utilized, the preacher relies more on rhetorical weight than fresh sensory detail in the final third. The balance of 'show vs tell' is generally healthy, particularly in the opening movement where the 'stench' of anxiety is replaced by the 'rest point' of the dwelling place.",
      "quotes": [
        "The rhetoric is like a large, stately fugue that sounds out the deepest sounds of reality while we imagine the mountains taking form.",
        "After all of that breathless effort, he comes to an awareness that God—all along—has been his true home, his safe house.",
        "We were gentle among you, like a nurse tenderly caring for her own children."

      "strengths": [
        "Strong central metaphor (The House) that organizes the entire aesthetic experience.",
        "Effective use of musical metaphors (fugue, sounds) to describe theological concepts.",
        "Vivid contrast between human 'hustle' and divine 'stately' permanence."

      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "The sermon begins with high 'showing' (the fugue, the mountains, the breathless runner) but moves toward 'telling' in the middle sections (defining the two great commandments and market ideology)."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise, characteristic of a 'stewardship of language' that avoids traditional 'Canaanite' jargon in favor of evocative, contemporary descriptors. Terms like 'Promethean', 'penultimate', and 'dialogic interaction' are used not as academic filler but as sharp tools to pierce contemporary self-perception. The preacher carefully balances the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed tradition with a modern rhetorical edge. There is a clear effort to define terms through their opposites (e.g., defining the 'work' by what it is not: wealth, power, greed). This precision prevents the sermon from drifting into vague sentimentality, maintaining a high level of intellectual and aesthetic integrity throughout.",
      "quotes": [
        "We now live in a Promethean, technological environment in which we are tempted to think that if we can get the right weapons...",

        "The term 'market ideology' is a bit of a sociological shorthand that could be unpacked with more poetic precision.",
        "Ensure that 'dialogic interaction' doesn't sound too clinical for a liturgical setting.",
        "The transition to the list of social groups (liberals, conservatives, etc.) feels slightly less 'cared for' and more like a standard inclusive list."

      "jargon_analysis": "The sermon successfully replaces tired theological jargon with fresh, intellectually stimulating terminology that remains accessible."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a rhythmic cadence that suggests it was written specifically for the ear. The use of repetition ('Too much violence, Too much poverty...') creates a litany-like effect that builds emotional resonance. The sentence structures vary effectively between long, flowing theological assertions and short, punchy imperatives. There is a palpable 'flow' that mirrors the 'stately fugue' mentioned in the text. The preacher uses parallelism and rhythmic lists to drive points home, particularly in the sections regarding the 'summons' and the 'work'. This musicality prevents the sermon from feeling like a lecture and instead elevates it to a performative event.",
      "quotes": [
        "Too much violence, / Too much poverty, / Too much destructiveness, / Too much misery.",
        "So hustle more, produce more, know more, control more.",

        "The conclusion could benefit from a more rhythmic 'coda' to match the strength of the opening 'fugue'.",
        "Watch for the 'list' format in the final summary; it can feel a bit bureaucratic compared to the earlier poetic flow."

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high level of micro-aesthetic quality. It avoids the 'Canaanite' jargon of traditional piety, opting instead for a 'stewardship of language' that is both intellectually sharp and poetically evocative. The central metaphor of the 'house' is well-sustained, and the rhythmic use of repetition creates a powerful liturgical atmosphere. While it occasionally leans toward sociological categories in its application, the overall linguistic care ensures that the 'form is the content,' reflecting a sober yet deeply moving aesthetic."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear, logical progression that functions as a 'homiletical plot.' It begins by establishing a 'rest point' (equilibrium), then introduces the 'upsetting' reality of mortality and the 'shattering' of self-perception. The movement into the second point introduces a 'contentious' tension—the human right to question God—which prevents the sermon from being a static teaching. The final movement resolves this tension by turning the 'house' into a place of 'glad obligation.' While the three-point structure is visible, it feels more like a journey through different rooms of a house than a dry enumeration. The energy remains high because the preacher consistently raises the stakes of what it means to 'dwell.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The first thing that happens in that house of deep shalom is that we are addressed by God in a way that may shatter our self-perception.",
        "This dwelling place is not a place of deferential silence.",
        "The outcome of lively engagement in the house of deep shalom is a fresh readiness with work to do."

      "strengths": [
        "Clear movement from the 'being' (dwelling) to 'speaking' (lament) to 'doing' (work).",
        "The introduction of 'contentious' speech provides a necessary dramatic tension.",
        "The sermon successfully links three disparate lectionary texts into a single coherent narrative arc."

        "The transition between the 'contentious speech' and the 'work of our hands' could be more organically linked—how does lament lead to work?",
        "The ending, while tidy, could benefit from a more dramatic 're-entry' into the world outside the house.",
        "The 'Reformation Sunday' theme feels slightly tacked on at the end rather than being woven into the narrative arc from the start."

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a prime example of Cilliers' 'reframing.' The preacher takes the ancient text of Psalm 90 and uses it to reframe the 'Promethean, technological environment' of the modern hearer. The connection between the Psalmist's 'dust' and our 'drugs and codes' is surprising and effective. The sermon does not smooth over the 'strangeness' of the text; rather, it highlights the 'primitive' nature of addressing God with imperatives as a necessary corrective to 'excessive modernity.' The integration is organic because the preacher finds the human 'inter-esse'—the space between our anxiety and God's eternity—and dwells there. It offers a genuine new perspective on security.",
      "quotes": [
        "We now live in a Promethean, technological environment in which we are tempted to think that if we can get the right weapons, or the right drugs...",
        "The Psalmist will not linger with us in our excessive piety or our excessive modernity.",
        "This news contradicts the market ideology all around us that requires us to qualify."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Masterful 'reframing' of ancient mortality language into contemporary technological critique.",
        "Respects the 'otherness' of the biblical text while making it urgently relevant.",
        "The application (love of neighbor) flows naturally from the theological premise of the 'house'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The mention of 'liberals and conservatives, gay and straight' feels a bit like a standard contemporary trope; it could be reframed more poetically.",
        "More concrete examples of 'the work of our hands' in a 21st-century context would strengthen the final integration.",
        "The link to Martin Luther is brief; a deeper integration of the 'Reformation' context would enhance the historical synthesis."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "The sermon successfully reframes the modern obsession with security and control through the lens of biblical transience and divine permanence."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is an 'open work of art' in its middle section, where it invites the hearer into 'contentious' dialogue with God and acknowledges the 'failure of God in the world.' This creates significant room for the hearer's own pain and doubt. However, the conclusion moves toward a more 'closed' and prescriptive ending. The list of social categories and the 'two great commandments' feel somewhat monovalent, directing the hearer toward a specific ethical path. While the invitation to 'dwell' remains open, the definitions of 'the work' become quite specific, potentially limiting the polyvalence that Stark advocates for. It acknowledges the ambivalence of existence but seeks to resolve it through 'glad obligation.'",
      "quotes": [
        "How long do we have to put up with this? ... This is quite a remarkable speech in the house of deep shalom.",
        "The gospel shared is the news that the creator God wants us all—liberals and conservatives, gay and straight...",
        "Welcome to the work that is to be done, the sharing of self for the sake of the whole house."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The section on lament (How long?) opens significant space for the hearer's struggle.",
        "Approaches the hearer as a mature partner capable of 'contentious' faith.",
        "The 'house' metaphor is spacious enough to allow for various forms of 'dwelling'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The conclusion is somewhat moralistic, telling the hearer exactly what the 'work' is rather than letting it emerge from the 'dwelling'.",
        "Avoid the 'list' of social groups, which can feel like a closed political statement rather than an open theological invitation.",
        "Leave the final prayer more as an open-ended blessing rather than a summary of 'tasks'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily an open work in its theological and lament-oriented sections, but tends toward a more closed, prescriptive structure in its ethical application."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is strong, characterized by a dynamic narrative arc that moves from the security of God to the reality of human suffering and finally to the call for service. The preacher effectively 'reframes' the biblical text for a modern audience, avoiding a static three-point structure in favor of a journey through the 'house of shalom.' While the ending becomes slightly more prescriptive and 'closed,' the inclusion of lament and the critique of modern 'Promethean' pride create a sophisticated dramaturgical movement that respects the complexity of the hearer's life."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It explicitly rejects 'excessive piety' and 'making nice with God,' which are the hallmarks of kitsch. Instead of offering 'immediate comfort' or a 'happy ending,' the preacher insists on the 'pain of suffering' and the 'failure of God in the world.' The emotions evoked are authentic (lament, awe) rather than sentimental. By sustaining the tension between God's eternity and human 'dust,' the sermon avoids the clichéd 'God has a plan' narrative. The 'house of shalom' is not a place of escape but a place of 'contentious' engagement, which is the antithesis of kitsch.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The phrase 'safe and secure from all alarms' flirts with kitsch, but is immediately subverted by the 'shattering' of self-perception.",
      "The list of social categories (gay/straight, etc.) can occasionally feel like a contemporary rhetorical cliché, though here it serves a specific 'reframing' purpose."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission of being 'fed up with the failure of God in the world' and the 'too muchness' of misery.",
      "The description of human life as 'nothing but dust' and a 'sigh,' refusing to sugarcoat mortality."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'hard-nosed' approach to grace; avoid the temptation to resolve the 'How long?' question too quickly with the 'two great commandments.'"
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens significant 'space for grace' by emphasizing that God is the 'dwelling place' that exists 'beyond our pride and our anxiety.' Cilliers' concept of 'reframing' is central here: the hearer is moved from a space of 'hustle and control' to a space of 'gift and shalom.' The mystery of God is respected, particularly in the 'stately fugue' of the opening. However, the space is slightly constricted in the final section by the move toward 'glad obligation' and ethical imperatives. While the preacher states that we live by 'unconditional love,' the heavy emphasis on 'the work of our hands' at the end risks closing the space that was so beautifully opened in the first half.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between human transience and divine eternity are well-sustained; the tension between God's promise and the world's misery is also held open.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'awesome, sure rest point' of God is treated with appropriate mystery and awe.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the first two-thirds, but moralization (the 'work we have to do') takes a prominent role in the conclusion.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure the 'work' is presented as a 'fruit' of dwelling in the house rather than a 'requirement' for staying there, to keep the space for grace fully open."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.3,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically sophisticated piece of homiletic art that successfully bridges the gap between ancient text and contemporary reality. Its primary strength lies in its 'stewardship of language' and its ability to 'reframe' the human condition through the lens of Psalm 90. The preacher avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by embracing the 'contentious' nature of faith and the reality of human mortality. The central metaphor of the 'house of deep shalom' provides a strong visual and emotional anchor, while the rhythmic, musical quality of the prose ensures an engaging oral performance. While the conclusion leans toward a more conventional ethical 'closing,' the overall movement of the sermon opens a profound 'space for grace' that invites the hearer into a deeper, more honest relationship with the Holy. It is a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that is intellectually rigorous yet emotionally resonant.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful reframing of biblical transience against modern technological pride.",
      "High linguistic precision and musicality that avoids religious jargon.",
      "Authentic engagement with lament and the 'failure of God' in the world."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The transition to the ethical 'work' could be less prescriptive and more 'open'.",
      "The Reformation Sunday theme could be more deeply integrated into the aesthetic fabric.",
      "The final summary could benefit from the same poetic intensity as the introduction."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Poetic-Reframing (Sober-Reformed with a New Homiletic influence)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'urbane' or intellectually engaged hearers who are weary of clichés and seek a faith that takes both modern complexity and biblical tradition seriously.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with leaving the conclusion more 'open' to allow the hearer to discover the 'work' themselves.",
      "Deepen the sensory details of the contemporary 'context' to match the vividness of the biblical 'text'.",
      "Continue to use musical and spatial metaphors to explain abstract theological concepts."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Through the lens of homiletic aesthetics, this sermon is a strong, effective 'event' that honors the 'stately' nature of the Word while speaking directly into the 'breathless' reality of modern life. It avoids the easy answers of kitsch and instead builds a 'house' where the hearer can safely encounter both the shattering address of God and the invitation to a life of grace. It is a model of how careful language and dramaturgical movement can create a space where 'the holy happens.'"
