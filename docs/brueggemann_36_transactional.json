    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically sophisticated and healthy. It identifies the 'Parent' ego state (tradition, family rules) as a necessary but limited stage of development. By using Peter's crisis as a proxy, the preacher allows the listener to process their own 'Adapted Child' fears without feeling attacked. It promotes autonomy by suggesting that 'unlearning' is a sign of spiritual maturity rather than rebellion.",

      "The 'snake sandwich' humor could be expanded to further engage the Free Child.",
      "Could provide more concrete 'Adult' examples of what 'unlearning' looks like in modern daily life."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using the 'we' pronoun to avoid the Persecutor role. The transition from 'Mother's love' to 'God's love' is an excellent example of using a 'Bridge' transaction to move listeners from a Child/Parent state into an Adult state."
