    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exceptionally healthy example of Adult-to-Adult communication. It avoids the common homiletic trap of the Critical Parent (shaming the congregation for the state of the world) and instead uses the Adult ego state to process historical and current reality. By admitting his own temptations to 'bet against the neighborhood,' the preacher avoids the Drama Triangle and models authentic, game-free vulnerability. The focus on 'wonder' and 'hope' invites the Free Child of the listener to engage without the pressure of the Adapted Child's fear-based compliance.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'must' regarding family obligation could be softened to further empower the Adult ego.",
      "Slightly more Free Child 'playfulness' could enhance the 'vista of poetry' mentioned."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' and 'I' to maintain the level playing field. Ensure that the 'invitation to the table' remains an Adult choice rather than a Parent-enforced ritual."
