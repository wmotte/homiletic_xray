    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a solid exegetical framework by contrasting the Babylonian exile with the contemporary 'Empire' of consumerism. The 'Sache' is the radical freeness of God's grace (Isaiah 55). However, the theological depth remains somewhat horizontal; the 'Empire' is well-defined, but the ontological nature of God's holiness is secondary to God's function as an alternative to capitalism. The exegesis of Luke 13 is brief, focusing on the 'fruit' as a functional outcome of repentance rather than exploring the tension of the theodicy present in the text. It is highly comprehensible but leans toward a sociological application of theology.",

        "Isaiah disrupts with his poem: Why do you spend your money on that which is not bread?",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as a 'productive guy' who identifies with the congregation. This is a strategic 'I-message' that prevents the sermon from sounding like a moralistic lecture from an outsider. There is a sense of shared struggle. The self-revelation is diaconal; it serves to build a bridge of solidarity. However, there is a slight 'Compulsive' tendency in the structured repetition of 'Big is better,' suggesting a preacher who finds security in clear, rhythmic rhetorical structures to maintain control over the message's impact.",
      "quotes": [
        "Well, I am a productive guy and I am glad to be among you, you company of productive people.",

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive/Depressive mix. Compulsive in the rhythmic, structured repetition and 'correctness' of the antithesis; Depressive in the strong desire for 'solidarity' and 'harmony' with the listeners.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Solidary' and 'Teaching'. The preacher addresses the congregation directly ('You Magnificent Mile people'), which creates a localized, specific connection. There is a potential for 'Relationship Noise' when he labels them 'productive types'—while intended as a compliment/identification, it could be heard as a pigeonholing 'You-message'. The tone is prophetic yet invitational. He avoids the 'paternalistic' trap by including himself in the critique of the empire.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon struggles with the Zuspruch/Anspruch balance. While it starts with the 'free gift' (Isaiah), it quickly pivots to a heavy appeal: 'Act baptized!', 'Return to your roots', 'Do the first fruit'. The theological 'Gift' (Pardon) is presented, but the 'Demand' (Repentance/Production of fruit) dominates the final third. There is a risk of 'Moralism' where the Gospel becomes a new, 'better' form of productivity (producing mercy instead of money), potentially replacing one 'rat-race' with a spiritual one.",
      "quotes": [
        "Act baptized!",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a rhetorically sophisticated and contextually sharp address. It masterfully uses the 'Blue' factual content of the Isaiah text to dismantle the 'Empire' logic of the congregation's daily life. Psychologically, the preacher establishes strong 'Yellow' rapport through 'Green' self-revelation as a 'productive guy.' However, from a Barthian perspective, the sermon risks 'psychologizing' the faith by framing God primarily as an 'alternative' to consumerist anxiety. The 'Red' appeal is forceful; while it calls for a return to identity, it leans heavily on human 'resolve' and 'productivity' (albeit a 'new' productivity). The transition from the 'Gift' of Isaiah to the 'Threat' of Luke is abrupt, potentially leaving the 'Appeal Ear' in a state of 'ready-to-jump' servility rather than 'Gospel rest.' The communicative integrity is strong, but the theological weight shifts from God's acting subjectivity to the human's reactive change in the final act.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon risks making God a 'reference point' for human lifestyle changes rather than the Sovereign Subject who acts upon the human.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Brilliant cultural hermeneutic (AT&T vs. Isaiah).",
      "Strong rhetorical rhythm and cadence.",
      "Effective localized application to the specific congregation."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Balance the 'Anspruch' (Demand) with more 'Zuspruch' (Promise) in the conclusion.",
      "Clarify the role of the Holy Spirit in 'bearing fruit' to avoid moralism.",
      "Deepen the Christological center to ground the 'alternative' in a Person, not just a program."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A highly effective, professional sermon that serves as a sharp wake-up call, though it teeters on the edge of replacing secular work-righteousness with spiritual work-righteousness."
