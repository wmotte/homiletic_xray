    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a strong 'hook' using the film Gladiator, which was culturally ubiquitous in 2001. This facilitates a shared experience. However, the sermon shifts quickly into cultural analysis. The most effective concrete experience occurs later with the illustration of Hosea Williams and the civil rights movement, which grounds the theology in human struggle. The 'Egypt' metaphor is used to connect the biblical narrative to the hearers' personal hardships, though these hardships remain somewhat generalized.",
      "quotes": [
        "BY NOW I expect many of you have seen Gladiator. It’s a rousing spectacle...",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength of the sermon. The preacher provides a sharp analysis of the 'spirituality' trend in America, using specific journalistic sources (NYT, WSJ) to explore the problem of 'redefining God.' He pauses to ask 'why' and 'how' the culture has shifted, identifying the loss of cultural supports for faith. He effectively contrasts the 'generic God' of modern preference with the 'particular God' of Scripture.",

The preacher moves from the specific text to the broader theological concept of God's self-definition. He makes clear logical connections between the Old Testament God and the God of Jesus Christ, countering Marcionite tendencies. The exegesis of 'I am who I am' is central and well-integrated.",

The application is largely internal/dispositional rather than ethical or behavioral. The mention of the 'offering' in the text is noted but not explicitly turned into a call for stewardship or specific service, except for the general call to 'worshiping community.'",

It identifies a significant 'problem' in the modern hearer's world—the tendency to subjectivize God—and provides a strong biblical/normative answer through the 'ancient Credo' of Deuteronomy. The sermon is a model of 'Declarative' preaching, using logic and historical evidence to advocate for the 'scandal of particularity.' However, it falls short of completing the Kolb cycle by failing to provide concrete, actionable steps for the 'Active Experimentation' phase. The hearer is well-informed and perhaps inspired, but not specifically equipped for practical Lenten discipline or ethical response in the world. The tone is sober and analytical, successfully avoiding sentimentality while maintaining theological depth.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a strong example of the 'Declarative' mode, providing a necessary theological correction to modern pluralism. It is highly effective for the 'Assimilating' hearer who values logic and tradition. From a Kolb perspective, the diagnosis is a 'half-cycle' success: it brilliantly moves the hearer from experience to reflection to conceptualization, but stops before the final step of experimentation. The priority for improvement is the transition from 'Who God is' to 'What we must therefore do.' It is a '7' in terms of theological depth but a '5' in terms of practical transformation."
