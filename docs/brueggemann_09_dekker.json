  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses two passages (Isaiah and Matthew) rather than one specific pericope. While it identifies unique imagery in Isaiah, it treats the texts as a 'repertoire' of images rather than a singular, non-interchangeable word. It leans toward general 'apocalyptic' ideas rather than what can be found nowhere else.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus took one of the images from the repertoire of Isaiah 25.",
        "The Bible has to use a host of images, because no single one is adequate."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus exclusively on one pericope (e.g., Isaiah 25) and extract the singular logic of that specific text instead of harmonizing it with a 'repertoire' of general biblical themes."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is largely sociological and imaginative. There is no engagement with the original languages (Hebrew/Greek) or the specific historical-theological context of Israel beyond general references to 'poor people' or 'finance buildings.' It lacks the academic rigor Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is perhaps like feelings toward the Kremlin in Moscow, or the palace of the Shah in Tehran.",
        "This is not just any old city. It obviously is the large government and finance buildings."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the specific historical context of the 'city' in Isaiah 25 and use linguistic insights to deepen the meaning of 'swallowing death' beyond modern cinematic metaphors like 'Jaws'."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete in its cultural references (Kremlin, Manila, Jaws), which Dekker values. However, it often slips into psychological generalities about 'new beginnings' and 'buoyancy' rather than specific ethical or ecclesial demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "The 'city' in London where are housed the great banks who own everything.",
        "You must give signs that you are prepared for newness and joy, ready to begin again with some buoyancy."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond psychological 'newness' to concrete contemporary choices regarding the 'two ways'—what specific 'deathly' structures must the hearer abandon today?"
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a clear 'Section I: Exposition' and 'Section II: Application' structure. This separation is exactly what Dekker warns against, as it treats the text as a historical object first and a current word second.",
      "quotes": [
        "I will name these five images from the poem.",
        "Did you notice that in the Gospel reading, Jesus told a parable?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Integrate the contemporary relevance directly into the explanation of the biblical imagery so the hearer is 'expounded' alongside the text."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'misery' (oppression, death, hunger) is well-articulated, and 'redemption' is clearly outside the self (God as sea monster/nursemaid). However, 'gratitude' is framed more as psychological 'buoyancy' than a Trinitarian response to grace.",
      "quotes": [
        "The news is that newness is not just an act of your willpower, but is an act God takes for us.",
        "You cannot sit and sulk and whimper, but live your life as a comforted one."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Strengthen the 'gratitude' aspect by linking the human response more clearly to the work of the Spirit rather than just 'turning loose of deathliness'."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is a strong point. The sermon explicitly addresses the 'wedding garment' as a serious requirement and warns against being an 'innocent bystander.' It touches on the possibility of being 'kicked out into the darkness.'",
      "quotes": [
        "And the host has him kicked out of the party, out into the darkness.",
        "You cannot act as though the character of God had nothing to do with you."

      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'temporal loss'—what does it mean for the congregation to be 'lost in time' if they refuse the wedding garment of God's justice?"

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "While Jesus is mentioned as a storyteller, Christ is not the 'telos' of the sermon. The sermon ends on a general 'point of newness' and a Psalm, rather than pointing to the person of Christ as the one in whom the 'two natures' meet to swallow death.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus took one of the images from the repertoire of Isaiah 25.",
        "God is my point of newness, I do not lack anything."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly identify Christ as the 'one Lord' who is the banquet and the one who swallowed death, rather than treating him as a secondary illustrator of Isaiah's themes."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 14.5 minutes (1450 words), the sermon fails Dekker's 20-minute minimum requirement. It lacks the 'breadth' needed for true theological depth.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the theological exposition of the 'two natures' or the specific historical context to reach the 20-minute threshold."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon fails significantly on formal grounds: it is too short, lacks rigorous linguistic exegesis, and separates exposition from application. Substantively, it lacks a strong Christological telos, treating Jesus more as a thematic bridge than the incarnate Lord. However, it effectively captures the 'misery' of the human condition and takes the 'two ways' seriously through the warning of the wedding garment.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete cultural imagery that avoids 'bland' religious language.",
      "Serious treatment of the 'two ways' and the necessity of a human response to God's action.",
      "Effective identification of 'misery' as a systemic and existential reality (oppression, death)."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (under 20 minutes) prevents the 'breadth' required for depth.",
      "Lack of engagement with original biblical languages and specific historical-theological context.",
      "Christ is a secondary figure rather than the central telos of the proclamation."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a thematic speech about biblical imagery rather than a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense. It lacks the formal rigor of specific pericope-based exposition and the substantive weight of a Trinitarian/Christocentric conclusion."
