    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. It utilizes a Parent-Child dynamic to induce guilt and nostalgia, effectively 'infantilizing' the listener. While it offers comfort, it does so by attacking the listener's Adult capacity for navigation ('shrewdness') and replacing it with a dependency on a 'sanctuary' where the 'world's noise cannot reach.' This creates a 'hiding' spirituality rather than an integrated, Adult faith.",

      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult invitation for the listener to solve their own problems through faith."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to validate the listener's 'shrewdness' as a gift that can be used for good, rather than a sin to be abandoned. Move from 'You must come home' (Parent) to 'How might we live out Bethel in the streets of New York?' (Adult)."
