    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of using high-level theological concepts (The Temple, Priesthood) to drive organizational compliance. While it offers significant 'Nurturing Parent' strokes (grace, forgiveness), it quickly pivots to a 'Critical Parent' stance that creates a dependency on the local church institution for spiritual validity. The denial of the 'Adult' capacity of the listener to grow outside the 'gathered people' is a significant psychological boundary crossing.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Invite participation from an Adult-Adult position by presenting the church's needs as a transparent 'request for partnership' rather than a 'spiritual requirement for healing.' Allow the listener the autonomy to decide where and how they 'access the glory' without labeling their choices as 'selfish'."
