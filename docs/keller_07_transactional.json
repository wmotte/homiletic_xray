  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Intellectualized Coercion.' While it uses high-level Adult language and provides genuine theological insight, it employs the Drama Triangle to motivate the congregation. It starts by elevating the listener (Royal Priesthood) but quickly uses that elevation as a platform for a Critical Parent demand for service. The psychological impact is a 'guilt-wrapped-in-grace' dynamic where the listener's value is subtly tied to their 'output.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement in the first half.",
      "Clear, logical structure that respects the listener's intellect.",
      "Effective use of Nurturing Parent to provide initial safety."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The shift from 'You are precious' to 'You are selfish if you don't volunteer' is a sharp psychological switch.",
      "The use of 'deadly' and 'bad for you' creates a fear-based Adapted Child response."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Avoid using the 'priesthood' identity as a leverage tool for institutional volunteering. Allow the 'Free Child' to respond to the 'preciousness' of the cornerstone without immediately attaching a 'Critical Parent' requirement for 'output.' Present the need for volunteers as an Adult-to-Adult request for help rather than a theological 'must' for spiritual health."
