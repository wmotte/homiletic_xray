    "summary": "This sermon is an exemplar of psychologically healthy homiletics. It avoids the common trap of using guilt (Critical Parent) to motivate action. Instead, it uses the Nurturing Parent to validate past suffering and the Adult to process the current social crisis. By extending the 'payoff' of the gospel even to the 'persecutors' (Rome, Pilate), the preacher effectively dismantles the Drama Triangle, refusing to cast the 'other' as a permanent Persecutor and the 'self' as a permanent Victim. This promotes a sense of 'I'm OK, You're OK' even in a context of extreme social injustice.",
