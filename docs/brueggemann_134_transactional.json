    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably game-free. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, treating the listeners as capable of processing complex historical and economic realities. By explicitly deconstructing the 'blame game' and 'scorekeeping,' the preacher dismantles the typical Critical Parent/Adapted Child dynamic found in many Lenten sermons. The use of creative metaphors (tattoo parlor) engages the Free Child, making the 'Law' (Torah) feel like an internal desire rather than an external imposition.",
    "strengths": [
      "Avoids the guilt-trip common in Lenten preaching.",
      "Uses the 'Adult' ego state to analyze systemic failures.",
      "Promotes autonomy through the concept of 'etched' internal motivation."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The rapid transition from 'Forgiveness' to 'New Obedience' could be perceived by a sensitive 'Adapted Child' as a hidden demand.",
      "The 'tattoo' metaphor, while creative, carries a slight 'Critical Parent' edge of permanence/pain."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'we' language to maintain the Adult-Adult transaction. Ensure the 'newness' is framed as a capacity given by God rather than a new set of 'musts' for the listener to achieve on their own."
