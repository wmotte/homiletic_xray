  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon exhibits a classic 'Bait and Switch' dynamic. It begins with the Free Child's attraction to an open invitation ('Come and see') but quickly transitions into Critical Parent territory, diagnosing the listener's failures (sin, lack of choice, laziness in evangelism). While theologically sound in its tradition, it psychologically fosters dependency and guilt rather than Adult autonomy. The mention of a specific scandal and social violence serves to reinforce a 'Victim' stance toward the world, making the church (and the preacher) the only 'Rescuer'.",
    "strengths": [
      "Clear use of metaphors (the painting, the Lamb).",
      "Addresses real-life hesitation and the difficulty of modern commitment."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "High level of 'should' and 'must' language (CP).",
      "The use of a recent scandal to induce guilt/reflection is a 'Gimmick' that bypasses the Adult ego."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as Adults capable of processing their own obstacles. Instead of 'What is hindering you?' (P->C), try 'How do you experience the tension between your daily life and this invitation?' (A->A). Reduce the 'Rescuer' role by acknowledging that the preacher doesn't have the 'fix' for the listener's fear."
