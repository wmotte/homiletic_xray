Shew me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths. [...] Because Christ is our shepherd, his helpers, his shepherd dogs, will protect us from enemies behind. 'Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.'",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively establishes a concrete experience through the character of 'Uncle Mannie' and the metaphor of the journey. It grounds the abstract concept of 'guidance' in the physical reality of aging and the limitations of human understanding. However, it lacks a specific, contemporary 'slice of life' crisis for the hearer to inhabit immediately, relying instead on a generalized metaphor of a road.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of the Visionary-Narrative style, excelling in the first half of Kolb's cycle. It begins with a relatable ancestral narrative that successfully facilitates Concrete Experience. It then moves into a deep Reflective Observation, diagnosing the modern ailment of self-sufficiency and the 'arrogance' of youth. The theological core (Abstract Conceptualization) is clear—humanity's status as 'creatures'—but it lacks exegetical rigor, relying instead on familiar biblical motifs. The most significant deficiency is in Active Experimentation; the sermon offers spiritual affirmations but fails to provide concrete, practical handles for the hearer to implement 'guidance' in daily life. The movement is poetic and rhythmic, favoring the Diverging learning style while largely neglecting the Converging style.",

      "Use a contemporary case study to ground the 'Reflective Observation' in the immediate present."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a rhetorically effective piece of visionary preaching that succeeds in making the hearer feel the weight of their own limitations and the beauty of God's guidance. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'half-cycle' sermon: it excels at taking the hearer into the experience and reflection phases but stops short of the 'doing' phase. It is a diagnostic success but a pragmatic weakness. To move from a 6 to an 8, the preacher must bridge the gap between the 'Shepherd' metaphor and the specific, messy decisions the congregation faces in their daily lives."
