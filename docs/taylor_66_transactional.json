  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and largely avoids manipulative games. It respects the listener's Adult ego by acknowledging the difficulty of faith and the reality of death. While it uses the Nurturing Parent position to offer comfort, it does so without shaming the 'Child' or demanding blind submission. The primary dynamic is an invitation to trust rather than a demand for obedience.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of empathy and identification with the listener.",
      "Avoidance of 'NIGYSOB' (fault-finding) dynamics.",
      "Strong Adult processing of the reality of grief."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'imperious word' section leans slightly into Critical Parent territory.",
      "The transition from 'decomposition' to 'miracle' could involve more Adult reflection on how one 'ventures forth' in the modern world."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'we' pronoun to maintain the Adult-Adult partnership. Ensure that the 'believing is seeing' concept is presented as a personal choice for the listener rather than a parental command."
