  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This is a psychologically mature sermon. It avoids the common homiletical trap of using the 'Critical Parent' to shame the 'Adapted Child' into obedience. Instead, it uses an 'Adult-Adult' transaction to analyze the power dynamics of the text. The preacher acknowledges the listener's intellectual resistance (especially in a university setting) and respects it, while still presenting a 'Free Child' sense of wonder regarding the 'overplus' of God. It promotes autonomy by framing faith as a conscious 'bet' or decision in an unequal world.",
    "strengths": [
      "High transparency regarding the 'awkwardness' of the message.",
      "Avoidance of the Drama Triangle; the preacher does not play the Rescuer.",
      "Strong use of 'we' language to prevent a Parent-Child hierarchy."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the 'Angel' section could risk becoming 'Nurturing Parent' smothering if not careful, though the preacher maintains Adult distance."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name the 'social' reality (university context) versus the 'psychological' reality (faith/wonder) to keep transactions crossed in a healthy, thought-provoking way."
