    "psychological_health_score": 2,
    "summary": "While homiletically powerful and poetically rich, the sermon is psychologically regressive. It relies heavily on the 'Critical Parent' ego state to induce fear and dependency in the listener. By framing life as a series of terrifying threats (subways, hospitals, pirates) and the listener as a 'fool' or 'infant,' the preacher establishes a 'Game' where the only solution is total submission to the religious system provided. This prevents the listener from developing an 'Adult' ego state capable of navigating reality with personal agency.",

      "High level of shaming/coercive language.",
      "Over-reliance on the Drama Triangle (Rescuer/Victim dynamic).",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult engagement."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as capable Adult partners in faith rather than frightened children. Replace 'must' and 'fool' with language that invites reflection. Instead of a 'formula' that promises to stop the storm, explore how the Adult ego can maintain integrity *during* the storm without resorting to magical thinking or total dependency."
