    "summary": "This sermon is a textbook example of 'Critical Parent' preaching. It utilizes high-pressure psychological tactics, specifically the fear of sudden death, to bypass the listener's Adult ego and trigger an Adapted Child response of compliance. While theologically grounded in the need for conversion, the method is manipulative, relying on the NIGYSOB game to trap the listener in a logical corner. The use of shaming metaphors (the crow) serves to dehumanize the listener's natural resistance to change, making the psychological impact one of anxiety rather than authentic spiritual growth.",

      "Dehumanizing language toward the congregation",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Shift from 'You must' (Parent) to 'What do we observe?' (Adult). Instead of using the uncertainty of death as a threat, use it as a shared reality to explore what makes life meaningful now. Replace shaming labels with descriptions of the human condition to invite the Free Child into a joyful response to grace rather than a fearful one."
