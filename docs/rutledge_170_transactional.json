        "presence": "Medium",
        "analysis": "The Nurturing Parent is present through empathy for those who have buried loved ones, but it avoids the 'smothering' trap by acknowledging that some grief has no easy fix.",

      "presence": "High",
      "analysis": "The preacher addresses the listener as a thinking subject, acknowledging the 'courts of the skeptics' and the reality of 'evolutionary science'. He treats doubt as a legitimate Adult processing of reality.",

        "analysis": "The preacher explicitly rejects the 'domesticated household pet' god that requires a compliant, unthinking child response.",

        "presence": "Medium",
        "analysis": "Authenticity is high, but the 'Free Child' joy is tempered by the heavy themes of death and dust. The 'Alleluia' feels more like a hard-won Adult conclusion than a spontaneous Child outburst.",

          "Alleluia! Christ is risen!"

  "transaction_analysis": {
    "primary_transaction_style": "Adult -> Adult",
    "analysis": "The preacher consistently invites the listener into an Adult-Adult transaction by validating doubt and the 'inconceivable' nature of the resurrection. He avoids the Parent-Child trap of 'I have the answers, you just need to obey.'",
    "ulterior_motives": "None detected. The preacher is transparent about his own 'struggle to believe'.",
    "communicative_purity_score": 9,
    "purity_explanation": "10 = Completely transparent. The preacher's social message (we are in the dark) matches the psychological message (it is okay to feel lost).",
    "risk_explanation": "The only risk is a subtle Nurturing Parent 'smothering' when discussing the death of children, but the preacher quickly pivots back to Adult reality."

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The preacher avoids 'ITHY' (I'm Only Trying To Help You) by refusing to provide the 'soothing explanations' that characterize that game. By admitting the resurrection is 'truly inconceivable,' he refuses to use a 'Con' to bait the listener into a false sense of security."

  "drama_triangle_analysis": {
    "preacher_roles": {
      "rescuer": "Low. He refuses to 'save' the listener from their doubt or grief with easy answers.",
      "persecutor": "None. He does not blame the listener for their lack of faith.",
      "victim": "Low. While he mentions his own struggle, it is used for Adult identification rather than seeking pity."

    "congregation_position": "The congregation is invited to be 'Observers/Thinkers' (Adult) rather than Victims of fate or Persecutors of God.",
    "escape_possibilities": "The sermon offers an escape through 'Revelation'—a move toward autonomy where the individual stands before God without the need for the Triangle's dysfunctional roles."
  },
  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably 'game-free'. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, acknowledging the reality of death, the validity of doubt, and the limits of human understanding. By refusing to play the Rescuer (offering platitudes) or the Critical Parent (demanding blind faith), the preacher fosters a space for authentic, autonomous faith. The use of the Alabama tornado story serves as a 'reality test' that prevents the sermon from drifting into a fantasy-based Child state.",
    "strengths": [
      "High Adult-Adult engagement.",
      "Validation of the listener's reality (doubt/grief).",
      "Avoidance of moralistic coercion (Critical Parent)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the 'Night' of John 20 to the 'Alleluia' could benefit from more Free Child spontaneity to balance the heavy Adult processing.",
      "The Job analysis is very intellectual; a brief moment of Nurturing Parent comfort for those currently in the 'whirlwind' could add warmth."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to share the 'struggle to believe.' This vulnerability prevents the 'I'm OK, You're Not OK' dynamic that fuels most homiletical games."
