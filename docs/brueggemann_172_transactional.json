    "summary": "The sermon is rhetorically brilliant but psychologically regressive. It utilizes a 'Nurturing Parent' stance to validate the 'Child' ego state of the listener while aggressively devaluing the 'Adult' (intellect, expertise, rationality). By repeatedly addressing the audience as 'babies' and 'infants,' it reinforces a dependency dynamic. It sets up a 'Drama Triangle' where the world is the Persecutor, the congregation is the Victim, and the preacher/Jesus is the Rescuer. While it offers 'rest,' it does so by encouraging a retreat from reality into a simplified, non-rational space.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Address the congregation as 'Adults' who can choose the way of Jesus with their minds intact. Avoid the diminutive 'baby' language which triggers regression. Instead of 'shaming the wise,' invite the 'wise' to use their Adult ego state in service of the Free Child's joy."
