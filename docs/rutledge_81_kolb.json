    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon attempts to ground the prophetic text in recognizable human experience, primarily through cultural references and the internal psychology of the prophet. However, it relies heavily on celebrity 'snapshots' rather than immersive storytelling. The hearer is invited to feel Jeremiah's misery, but the connection to the hearer's own daily life is somewhat mediated through the lens of news and tabloids rather than direct personal resonance.",
      "quotes": [
        "We know more about Jeremiah from the inside out than any other Old Testament figure. That’s what interests us in our day.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The cultural examples (Britney Spears, Tiger Woods) are dated and feel like 'spectator' experiences rather than 'concrete' experiences for the hearer.",

      "homiletical_manifestations": "Manifests as a 'psychological profile' of the prophet and a 'cultural mirror' using 2009-era news events."
    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher pauses significantly at the 'human dilemma,' exploring the 'why' of human corruption. It moves beyond superficial symptoms to identify underlying patterns of fear and silence. The sermon effectively uses the 'wisdom of the sage' to analyze why good people remain silent in corporate or social structures.",
      "quotes": [
        "This fear keeps us from speaking out, taking a stand, disturbing the peace.",
        "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately corrupt; who can understand it?"

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is theologically robust. It provides a clear 'big idea': the Old Testament as the 'operating system' for the New Covenant. It moves logically from the total depravity of the heart to the necessity of a divine transaction. The exegesis of Jeremiah 31 is central and well-connected to Christology and the Eucharist.",
      "quotes": [
        "The New Testament (the New Covenant) simply does not work without the Old Testament. The Old Testament is the operating system of the New.",

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the sermon concludes with a call to identity ('I am a creature of the New Covenant'), it lacks specific, concrete action steps. The application remains largely internal and cognitive. The hearer is told *who* they are, but not specifically *what* to do tomorrow morning in the face of the 'dishonest practices' mentioned earlier.",
      "quotes": [
        "And so the next time we are tempted to go along with whatever the corrupt world is doing, we can say to ourselves...",
        "Every Christian who lives by this promise is a sign planted by God in this world."

        "Provide a specific example of 'speaking out' or 'disturbing the peace' as a New Covenant person.",
        "The 'how-to' is missing; it assumes that knowing one's identity automatically translates to ethical courage without guidance."
      ],
      "homiletical_manifestations": "Manifests as an internal ethical call and a change in self-perception, but lacks external 'active' experimentation."

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of a 'teaching sermon' that excels in theological clarity and cultural reflection but falls short in practical application. It successfully identifies the 'human dilemma' by moving from the psychological interiority of Jeremiah to the systemic corruption of the modern world. The theological 'pivot' to the New Covenant is handled with logical precision and visionary beauty. However, the sermon remains largely in the realm of the 'Assimilating' learning style. It provides the hearer with a new 'operating system' (theology) and a new 'identity' (New Covenant creature), but it fails to provide the 'user manual' for how that identity functions in the specific ethical dilemmas raised earlier in the sermon (e.g., corporate dishonesty). The cycle is nearly complete, but the final phase of Active Experimentation is more of a cognitive affirmation than a call to concrete action.",

      "Use more 'Guide/Coach' language to help hearers navigate ethical 'gray areas'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This is a high-quality, theologically dense sermon that serves the 'Head' and 'Heart' well. Its diagnosis of the human condition is sober and traceable, and its Christological resolution is clear. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon—strong on reflection and conceptualization, but light on application. It is perfectly suited for its original audience of leaders and clergy who value theological frameworks, but for a general congregation, it would require more pragmatic 'handles' to ensure the learning cycle leads to lived transformation."
