    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and largely game-free. It utilizes a strong Nurturing Parent ego state to provide emotional security during Lent. While it sets up a Drama Triangle where Life/Death are Persecutors and the listener is a Victim, it offers a clear, non-coercive 'Rescuer' in Christ. The preacher's Adult ego state is active in his nuanced handling of the Old Testament text, preventing the sermon from sliding into fundamentalist Critical Parent territory.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of Adult ego state in biblical interpretation.",
      "Avoidance of shame-based Critical Parent language.",
      "Authentic Free Child creativity in the 'Scarlet Thread' metaphor."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The distinction between 'community of life' and 'death' could be perceived as a subtle 'Us vs. Them' game.",
      "Heavy reliance on the Nurturing Parent can sometimes discourage Adult responsibility in the listener."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To further strengthen Adult-Adult transactions, ask the congregation more reflective questions that require them to process their own 'siege of life' rather than providing the poetic solution immediately."
