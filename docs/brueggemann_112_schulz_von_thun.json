    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a solid exegetical framework of the encounter between Jesus and the Sadducees. It correctly identifies the Sadducees' theological position (denial of resurrection) and the trap they set. The preacher successfully connects the Gospel text with Psalm 17, creating a cohesive biblical-theological arc. However, the 'Sache' (the living Christ) is somewhat flattened into a metaphor for 'change' and 'newness'. While the exegesis is accurate, it remains largely on a socio-political level (power arrangements, status quo) rather than diving into the ontological depth of the resurrection. The 'blue' side is clear but leans toward a sociological interpretation of the Kingdom of God as a disruption of human systems rather than a strictly Christological event.",
      "quotes": [
        "They recognized that Jesus, in his subversive way, was a threat to their power arrangements.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher maintains a professional, almost academic distance. There is very little 'involuntary' leakage of personal struggle or specific faith experience. The 'I' is almost entirely absent, replaced by a collective 'we'. This suggests a preacher who identifies strongly with the role of the 'prophetic observer'. The self-revelation is highly controlled; the preacher reveals themselves as someone who values intellectual disruption and the critique of institutional power. There is a sense of 'knowing better' than the 'old Sadducees', which might leak as a subtle form of intellectual superiority. The authenticity is found in the passion for 'the new', but it feels more like a theological conviction than a personal testimony.",
      "quotes": [
        "It does not require much imagination to see...",
        "We know that the old categories do not work...",
        "The truth is that we are all now at a risk point."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Schizoid mix. The preacher seeks control through clear structure and intellectual categories (Compulsive) while maintaining a safe, analytical distance from the emotional or personal vulnerability of the text (Schizoid).",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is subservient to the text, but almost to the point of being a detached mouthpiece for a specific theological school of thought.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher/Prophet to Congregation'. The preacher uses the 'we' pronoun extensively, which can be inclusive but also paternalistic, as it assumes the congregation shares the preacher's specific anxieties about 'old categories'. There is a subtle 'from above' quality; the preacher diagnoses the congregation's condition (being like Sadducees) without necessarily standing in the same line of judgment. The tone is sober and demanding. The relationship noise occurs where the preacher assumes the listeners are 'opinion-makers' or 'Sadducees'—this might alienate those who feel powerless or who do not see themselves in the 'big steeple' critique.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are like these old Sadducees; we would like to imagine that the future will be like the past.",
        "We are nourished not by great gulps of control and certitude...",

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily an invitation to 'let go' and 'trust'. The preacher successfully navigates the tension between Law (the failure of our old math) and Gospel (the new math of fidelity). The 'red' side is not a moralistic 'do better', but a theological 'be open'. However, the appeal to 'get on with the new life' at the end remains somewhat vague. The 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is the steadfast love of God, which is presented as the foundation for the 'Anspruch' (Appeal) to live without fear. The ratio is well-balanced, though the 'Gospel' side (Zuspruch) feels slightly more like a philosophical concept of 'newness' than the specific, historical grace of the cross and resurrection.",
      "quotes": [
        "We need only to be dazzled and grateful, open to God’s fidelity.",

    "disruptions": "There is a slight 'chafing' between the yellow side (we are all in this) and the green side (the preacher as the one who has diagnosed the problem).",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a well-crafted, intellectually stimulating sermon that excels in its structural clarity and thematic consistency. It successfully bridges the gap between a difficult Gospel text and the contemporary experience of institutional decline. Theologically, it leans heavily on the 'God of the Future' (Moltmann/Brueggemann influence), presenting the resurrection as a categorical disruption. Psychologically, the preacher remains in a 'teaching' mode, which provides safety but limits existential depth. The sermon's greatest strength is its refusal to offer easy moralism, instead pointing toward the 'bottomless' fidelity of God. However, it risks 'psychologizing' the resurrection by turning it into a metaphor for 'letting go of control' rather than a cosmic victory over death. The Barthian 'Sache'—the acting subject of God—is present but occasionally obscured by the preacher's focus on human 'categories' and 'calculus'.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a risk of turning God into a 'Narrative-Breaking Concept' rather than the Living Lord. The focus on 'our categories' vs 'God's future' can become a human philosophy of change if not anchored in the specific flesh of Christ.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Excellent integration of Psalm 17 and Luke 20.",
      "Strong rejection of moralistic 'Law' in favor of 'Trust'.",
      "Clear, logical progression of thought."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Increase personal vulnerability (Green side) to model the 'letting go' described.",
      "Ground the 'newness' more specifically in the person of Jesus.",
      "Address the 'Relationship Ear' with more warmth to balance the sharp prophetic critique."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A solid, professional sermon that effectively communicates a difficult theological concept but lacks the 'exceptional' spark of personal or spiritual vulnerability that would move it beyond a 7."
