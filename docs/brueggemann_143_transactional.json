    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' By maintaining an Adult-Adult transaction, the preacher respects the listener's autonomy. The transition from the theological (Talk) to the ethical (Walk) is presented as an invitation to empowerment ('clothed with power') rather than a Critical Parent demand ('you must do more'). It avoids the 'Ain't It Awful' game by focusing on the 'wonder' and 'newness' rather than just the 'deathly structures.'",

      "Slight risk of the 'Rescuer' role when discussing social justice—ensure the 'beggar' is seen as a subject, not just an object of church work.",
      "Could incorporate more Free Child spontaneity to balance the heavy Adult analysis."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'Notice' and 'Imagine'—these are excellent Adult-state hooks that invite the listener to process reality alongside you rather than submitting to your authority."
