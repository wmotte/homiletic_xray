[...] Or what will you have on your mind now that is fresh and life-giving, and beyond the ordinary?"

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's primary requirement of focusing on ONE specific Bible passage. Instead, it treats three disparate texts (Philippians, Ezekiel, Matthew) as thematic illustrations for the concept of 'changing one's mind.' This approach reduces the Word to a 'biblical idea' or 'keyword,' which Dekker explicitly forbids.",
      "quotes": [
        "In Philippians there is a bid to get a new mind in Christ; In Ezekiel there is an offer of a new heart and a new spirit; In the story of Jesus, there is an exposé of hard hearts..."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is superficial. While it mentions the 'chief priests' and 'tax collectors,' it treats them as archetypes rather than historical-theological entities. There is no evidence of Greek/Hebrew study or engagement with the specific theology of the biblical books in their original context.",
      "quotes": [
        "The two sons in the story are stand-ins for the people in front of Jesus.",
        "The ancient prophet, Ezekiel, knows that other stuff enters our minds..."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part, showing a 'broad knowledge of the humanities' (Lifton) and the zeitgeist. However, it often veers into generalities (economic maneuvering, sexual relations) rather than the concrete life of the specific congregation.",
      "quotes": [
        "The economic dimension... is put there for theological liberals... sexual misconduct is put there for theological conservatives.",

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a 'block' structure: Text I, Text II, Text III, then Application (Lifton). This separation prevents the 'present of revelation' Dekker seeks. The hearer is an observer of the texts rather than being 'expounded' by them.",
      "quotes": [
        "I. The epistle reading... II. But take the harder form... III. And then this story about Jesus... IV. It is not easy to change our minds..."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon addresses 'misery' (totalism, hard hearts) and 'redemption' (new mind), but it leans heavily on human psychology and the 'will' to change. It risks being too human-oriented without the necessary Trinitarian background.",
      "quotes": [
        "In the Gospel we are invited to a new mind, a new heart, a new spirit...",
        "He finds a common pattern... that he calls 'totalism'..."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon takes the 'two ways' seriously, particularly the concept of being 'lost in time' through ideological totalism. It confronts the hearer with a choice, though the 'eternal' dimension is largely absent.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ezekiel exposes the old mind of death.",

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the 'telos' (the one who comes otherwise), but the sermon borders on 'exemplarism'—Jesus as the one who shows us how to think, rather than the ontological Savior (two natures) who is our life.",
      "quotes": [
        "Think like him! His mind... was to give himself up... And you, think like him!",

      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "At approximately 1,150 words, the sermon lasts roughly 11-12 minutes. This is significantly below Dekker's 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for 'depth'.",

  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily due to its thematic, multi-text approach and its insufficient length. It functions more as a theological-psychological essay on 'changing one's mind' than an exposition of a specific Bible passage. While the engagement with cultural philosophy (Lifton) is adequate, it overshadows the specific biblical revelation.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective use of humanities/psychology to diagnose the 'zeitgeist' (totalism).",
      "Clear attempt to address the 'two ways' and the seriousness of human choice.",
      "Avoids 'soft' preaching by addressing economic and sexual exploitation."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Thematic 'keyword' preaching (the 'mind') instead of specific pericope exposition.",
      "Insufficient duration (11-12 minutes) prevents theological depth.",
      "Exegesis is subordinated to the preacher's psychological framework."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is a thematic address. To become a sermon, it must abandon the three-text structure, double its length, and allow a single text to dictate a unique word that cannot be found elsewhere."
