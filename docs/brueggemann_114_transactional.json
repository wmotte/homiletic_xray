      "analysis": "The preacher operates heavily from the Adult position, processing historical context (Paul’s situation), linguistic nuances (Greek vs. English), and contemporary reality (oil spills, policy issues).

Even when quoting the Parent-like commands of Paul, he processes them through an Adult analytical lens (e.g., explaining the context of the 'free lunch' text).",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely avoids the manipulative traps common in homiletics. By operating from an Adult ego position, the preacher respects the listener's autonomy. He uses the 'Parent' voice of scripture not to crush the 'Child' but to provide a framework for the 'Adult' to act in the world. The focus on 'neighborliness' and 'contribution' promotes agency rather than dependency. The only minor risk is a slight 'Critical Parent' stance toward those outside the church structure, which could foster a 'We are OK, They are Not OK' dynamic.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "Rejection of fear-based 'Orange Alert' psychology.",
      "Empowerment of the listener as a capable contributor."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Reduce the Critical Parent 'shaming' of the 'spiritual but not religious'.",
      "Incorporate more 'Free Child' spontaneity to balance the heavy Adult analysis."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' to maintain symmetry. When using harsh biblical imperatives, continue the practice of 'Adult' contextualization to prevent them from becoming 'Critical Parent' weapons."
