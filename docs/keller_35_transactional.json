    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy because it primarily operates from the Adult ego state. It respects the listener's intelligence and avoids the 'Critical Parent' trap of moralistic shaming. While it uses a 'Bait and Switch' logic to move from secularism to the Resurrection, it does so through transparent reasoning rather than emotional manipulation. The preacher encourages autonomy by asking the listener to evaluate their own 'moral intuitions' and 'deepest desires.'",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to frame the 'Unknown God' argument as an invitation to self-discovery rather than a 'gotcha' moment to ensure the transaction remains Adult-Adult."
