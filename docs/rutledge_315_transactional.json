    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The sermon avoids games like ITHY or NIGYSOB. Instead of blaming the listener for not being 'loving enough,' the preacher presents the 'New Community' as a gift and a reality created by Christ, not a burden to be achieved through guilt."

      "victim": "Low. She expresses 'heart ache' for the church, but not as a personal grievance or a 'poor me' stance."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, using exegetical data to challenge sentimental (Parental) traditions. By moving the focus from 'taking care of mothers' (Parent-Child) to 'creating a new family' (Adult-Adult/Free Child), the preacher promotes a healthy, autonomous understanding of faith community. The use of personal narrative is illustrative rather than coercive.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement through biblical scholarship.",
      "Vulnerability and authenticity in personal anecdotes.",
      "Avoidance of 'Bait & Switch' tactics regarding grace and law."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the Catholic rectory story to the critique of church sin is slightly abrupt.",
      "Could further empower the 'Free Child' by describing more specific, joyful manifestations of this new community."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' to deconstruct 'Critical Parent' traditions. Ensure that when using the 'Nurturing Parent' (NP), it remains focused on empowering the listener's autonomy rather than fostering a dependency on the preacher's insights."
