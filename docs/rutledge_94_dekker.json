The famed “Tome of Leo” became a conclusive statement of orthodox Christology [...] You only, Christ, as Lord we own and with the Spirit, you alone share in the Father’s glory."

    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The text fails Dekker's primary requirement of being an 'exposition of a specific Bible passage.' It functions as a thematic essay on 'glory' (kavod/doxa) rather than a recreation of one pericope. It jumps between the Prologue of John, Exodus, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Pauline epistles.",
      "quotes": [
        "A good place to begin is one verse from the prologue of the Gospel of John...",
        "The Psalms are full of God’s glory...",
        "One of the most memorable biblical visions of God’s glory is when God shows himself to the prophet Isaiah..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one pericope (e.g., John 1:14 or Isaiah 6) and extract what is unique to THAT text which cannot be found elsewhere, rather than synthesizing a general biblical concept."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "While the preacher demonstrates linguistic knowledge (kavod, doxa) and historical awareness (Leo the Great, Chalcedon), the exegesis is used to support a dogmatic theme rather than to uncover the original intent of a specific historical text.",
      "quotes": [
        "In the biblical languages, the word for glory is kavod in Hebrew, doxa in Greek.",
        "In secular Greek, doxa refers to honor given to someone who is thought to have earned it."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus the linguistic and historical tools on the specific context of one passage to answer 'What did this mean for the first readers?' instead of providing a lexicon overview."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application remains largely in the realm of 'general truths' which Dekker forbids. While it mentions 'Beyoncé' or 'Wikipedia,' these are used as illustrations of concepts rather than concrete applications to the spiritual or social life of the specific congregation.",
      "quotes": [
        "The body of Christ needs to recommit to this concept of the glory of God.",
        "What resonance does the word glory have in today’s English language? ... we might hear of a pop star such as Beyoncé."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured as a lecture. It explains a concept and then suggests why the church needs it. The hearer is an observer of a theological argument rather than being 'drawn into the text' and 'expounded' by it.",
      "quotes": [
        "Perhaps the very word glory seems bombastic to some...",
        "We should not come to an epiphany too quickly, before we absorb the message from the burning bush."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Abandon the 'lecture' format (What is X? Why do we need X?) and let the application emerge directly from the movement of the scriptural narrative."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is a strong point. The preacher effectively utilizes the categories of misery (Isaiah's 'Woe is me', the 'stench' of death) and redemption (grace as pure gift). The connection to the Heidelberg Catechism is explicit.",
      "quotes": [
        "His vision of the glory of God results in an instantaneous perception of the contrast between God’s purity and his people’s contamination.",
        "Because I belong to him, Christ, by his Holy Spirit, assures me of eternal life..."

      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'misery' is not just a theological category but a psychological reality for the modern hearer."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon acknowledges the possibility of being 'lost' and the 'terror of the Lord,' which aligns with Dekker's demand for taking the destination of man seriously. However, it leans toward the 'objective' side of the glory rather than the 'willing and responsible' choice of the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "Woe is me! For I am lost...",
        "Therefore it serves as a judgment upon anyone who does not acknowledge it, whether they know it or not."

    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "The sermon is strongly Christocentric. It correctly identifies Christ as the telos and emphasizes that grace is the 'deepest of our life.' It maintains the doctrine of the two natures (Chalcedon) as the basis for the sermon.",
      "quotes": [
        "The one Lord who is central in the sermon is Christ.",
        "The connection between the glory of God shown forth in Christ and the crucifixion of Jesus should never be severed."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid letting Christ become a 'theme' of glory; ensure He remains the 'acting subject' who encounters the hearer through the specific text."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 9,
      "findings": "At approximately 3,400 words, the sermon provides the 'breadth' Miskotte and Dekker demand for 'depth.' It exceeds the 20-minute threshold significantly, allowing for substantive theological reflection.",
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this breadth but focus it on one text rather than a systematic overview of a motif."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text functions more as a theological treatise or a teaching-essay on the motif of 'Glory' than a sermon according to Dekker's formal definition. It fails the primary test of being an 'exposition and application of a specific Bible passage,' instead opting for a thematic survey. However, it is substantively strong in its Trinitarian depth, its refusal to succumb to 'liberal' moralism, and its insistence on the 'extra nos' (outside ourselves) nature of grace.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Trinitarian and Christological foundation (Thesis 7).",
      "Serious treatment of human misery and the need for redemption (Thesis 5).",
      "Adequate length to allow for theological 'depth' (Thesis 8)."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of a specific pericope; it is a topical speech about 'glory' (Thesis 1.3).",
      "Application is often general and academic rather than concrete and contemporary (Thesis 3).",
      "The structure is that of a lecture, separating exposition from application (Thesis 4)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "According to Dekker’s strict formal definition, this is not a sermon. It is a 'speech about a biblical idea' (Glory). While the content is theologically adequate and avoids the pitfalls of dechristianized moralism, it fails to 'recreate the Bible into a new, current, proclamatory word' by neglecting the specificity of a single text."
