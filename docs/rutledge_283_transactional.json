    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exemplary model of psychologically healthy homiletics. It avoids the common trap of using the 'Binding of Isaac' as a tool for Critical Parent coercion (demanding blind obedience). Instead, it utilizes the Adult ego state to process the 'strangeness' of the text, validating the listener's natural resistance. By sharing personal vulnerabilities (fear for grandchildren, grief for a friend), the preacher creates a Nurturing Parent/Free Child connection that feels authentic rather than manipulative. The sermon moves toward a climax of faith without resorting to a 'Bait and Switch' game, maintaining transparency about the 'Godforsakenness' of the journey.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the 'substitutionary' theology at the end is slightly abrupt compared to the nuanced Adult exploration of the rest of the text.",
      "Could further empower the 'Free Child' by exploring the 'laughter' of Sarah more deeply."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Guide' metaphor; it successfully positions the preacher as an Adult resource rather than a Parental authority figure."
