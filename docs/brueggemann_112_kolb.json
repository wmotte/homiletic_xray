    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a narrative 'hook' regarding the Sadducees, but it remains somewhat distant. The 'Concrete Experience' for the hearer is primarily intellectual-historical rather than visceral. While it mentions 'big steeple churches' and 'tenured professors,' these are archetypes rather than a lived-in 'slice of life' that evokes immediate emotional empathy. The connection to the hearer's world is delayed until section V, which limits the initial engagement to a cognitive observation of a biblical scene rather than a felt experience.",

      "homiletical_manifestations": "Manifests as a historical narrative reconstruction with modern professional labels used as placeholders for identification."
    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher spends significant time exploring the 'why' behind the Sadducees' question—identifying it as a mechanism for control and maintenance of the status quo. The sermon effectively analyzes the human tendency to project the present into the future to ensure safety. It pauses to consider the 'problem' of our explanatory categories failing us, which facilitates a deep reflective stance for the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "They imagined that their math would let them be the big players in the next age as they are in the present age.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a clear theological framework centered on 'God’s newness' versus 'human mastery.' The exegesis of the Lucan text is systematic, breaking down Jesus' response into three logical points. The 'Big Idea'—the New Math of Fidelity—is a strong conceptual anchor. However, the theological depth is more rhetorical than dogmatic; it relies on powerful metaphors ('narrative-breaking God') rather than a dense exploration of the doctrine of resurrection itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "Resurrection is not just life after death or revivification of the dead; it is the coming of the new rule of God that breaks open all of our patterns of control.",

      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. The sermon concludes with an invitation to 'be dazzled' and 'get on with the new life,' but these remain abstract and poetic rather than concrete. There are no specific action steps or ethical calls. The transition to the Table (Eucharist) provides a liturgical application, but the 'how' of living 'beyond fear and control' in the Monday-to-Saturday world is left to the hearer's imagination. It lacks the 'Active' component of Kolb's cycle.",
      "quotes": [

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of a 'Visionary-Declarative' approach. It succeeds in deconstructing human attempts at control and mastery by contrasting them with the 'New Math' of God's fidelity. The preacher effectively uses the biblical narrative of the Sadducees to mirror contemporary anxieties about failing societal structures. However, the sermon is significantly imbalanced toward the upper half of Kolb's cycle (Reflection and Conceptualization). While it provides profound theological insights and imaginative metaphors, it fails to translate these into concrete, actionable steps for the congregation. The 'Active Experimentation' phase is relegated to a general call to be 'dazzled' and a transition to the Eucharist, which may leave the 'Accommodating' and 'Converging' learners without a clear path forward in their daily lives. The language is sober and intellectually stimulating, avoiding clichés, but it risks remaining in the realm of 'abstract idealism'.",

      "Strategic advice 1: Start with a concrete, modern story of a person facing the 'failure of old math' to strengthen Phase 1.",
      "Strategic advice 2: Include a 'How-to' section or a 'Practice for the week' to engage the Converging learner.",
      "Strategic advice 3: Use more sensory and 'feeling' language when describing the 'new life' to move from the head to the heart/hands."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a well-crafted theological reflection that excels in cultural interpretation and visionary inspiration. It effectively diagnoses the human condition of 'control-seeking' and offers a compelling alternative in God's 'steadfast love.' From a Kolb perspective, however, it is incomplete. It provides the 'what' and the 'why' with great clarity but leaves the 'how' largely unaddressed. It is a sermon for the 'head' and the 'imagination,' but it stops short of being a sermon for the 'feet.' To move from a score of 6 to an 8, the preacher must bridge the gap between the 'dazzling' vision of God's future and the mundane realities of the hearer's Monday morning."
