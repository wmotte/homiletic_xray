It systematically deconstructs the 'Mercantile Game' (Do ut des) where humans act as Adapted Children to a Critical Parent God. By validating the 'Atheistic Shadow' and the 'Dignity of Untimeliness,' Sölle and Steffensky promote psychological autonomy and authentic Adult-Adult faith.",

      "The transition to the 'Power of God' at the end could be perceived as a slight 'Bait & Switch', though it is framed as 'Trotz' (defiance).",
      "The complexity of the Adult discourse may exclude those in a high-stress Child state who need more immediate NP containment."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name the 'double bottoms' of religious language. Ensure that the 'hope' offered at the end remains a 'Free Child' expression of joy rather than a 'Parental' demand for optimism."
