    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically heavy and transactionally manipulative. While it uses the language of 'mercy,' it frames the entire human experience as a legalistic debt-cycle. The move in §3 to leverage Christ's death to guilt parents into 'offering their children' is a classic 'Bait & Switch' game. It fosters dependency and guilt rather than Adult autonomy or Free Child joy.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Shift from Parent-Child 'debt' metaphors to Adult-Adult 'invitation.' Instead of asking 'How can we repay?' (which triggers guilt), ask 'How shall we respond?' (which triggers Adult agency). Avoid using the sacrifice of Christ as a lever to demand specific behavioral compliance regarding children."
