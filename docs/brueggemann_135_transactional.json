    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' By operating primarily from the Adult ego state, the preacher respects the autonomy of the listener. The focus on 'Covenant' as a relationship of 'risk, freedom, and obligation' mirrors the TA goal of 'Intimacy'—game-free, candid exchange. The critique of 'anti-dialogic' power is a psychological defense of the Adult state against the 'Critical Parent' of oppressive social systems.",

      "The high intellectual level may occasionally leave the 'Free Child' (emotions/spontaneity) behind.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize the 'risk' and 'freedom' of the listener to respond. To ensure the 'Free Child' is engaged, consider adding more sensory or narrative imagery to the 'abundance' of the table."
