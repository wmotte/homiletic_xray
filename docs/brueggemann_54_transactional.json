  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust, moving the listener from a state of Adapted Child anxiety (fear of politics/judgment) toward Adult reflection and Free Child celebration. It successfully uses the Nurturing Parent archetype of God to provide a 'secure base' for the listener to explore the world without fear. While it occasionally leans into Critical Parent territory when addressing social issues (greed/hate), it does so to protect the 'vulnerable' (NP), which maintains a high level of psychological health.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement with the biblical text.",
      "Validates the listener's feelings of anxiety before offering a solution.",
      "Promotes autonomy by framing faith as a 'lifelong vocation' of daily decisions."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition in section V can feel like a 'list of demands,' which may trigger the Adapted Child's 'must-comply' reflex.",
      "The 'liars' quote from 1 John is a heavy Critical Parent tool that could be softened to maintain Adult dialogue."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To remain entirely game-free, ensure that the 'new management' directives are presented as invitations to participate in a new reality rather than a new set of 'shoulds' that replace the old ones."
