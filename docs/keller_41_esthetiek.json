    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The imagery is functional and illustrative rather than poetic or evocative. The preacher utilizes the biblical metaphors of 'fortified cities' and 'towers' effectively to explain psychological states of security. However, the language remains largely conceptual. There is a strong reliance on 'explaining' the image rather than letting the image speak for itself. The 'mining for nuggets' metaphor at the start is a standard homiletic trope that lacks freshness. The most vivid imagery appears in the description of the crucifixion, where sensory details like 'bones crunched' and 'flesh pulled' provide a stark, visceral contrast to the earlier abstract discussion of economics. Overall, the imagery serves the 'teaching' function but rarely achieves the 'cinematic' quality advocated by Paul Scott Wilson.",
      "quotes": [
        "The store owner would take a weight... and put it on the scale. You put the grain on the other side.",
        "The wealth of the rich is their fortified city; they imagine it a wall too high to scale.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Predominantly 'telling'. The preacher explains what the images mean rather than allowing the hearer to experience the image first."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The stewardship of language is a primary strength. The preacher exhibits high precision in defining terms, particularly the distinction between 'righteous' and 'wicked' based on community impact. This 'reframing' of traditional religious jargon into social-ethical categories is masterful. The language is clear, accessible, and avoids 'Canaanite' jargon without sacrificing theological depth. There is a deliberate care in how 'abomination' is handled, comparing business ethics to sexual morality to challenge the audience's presuppositions. The word choice is economical and hits the core of the human condition (shame, identity, security). It reflects Marilyn Chandler McEntyre’s ideal of 'caring for words' by refusing to let them remain vague religious platitudes.",
      "quotes": [
        "The wicked person is someone who disadvantages the community to advantage himself.",
        "It hollows you out. It doesn’t make you a person of character but a person of superficiality.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is clearly written for the ear, following an oral logic of repetition and reinforcement. There is a rhythmic quality to the 'scattering gathers and gathering scatters' chiasm, which functions as a rhetorical hook. However, the sentence structure is often repetitive and didactic ('The reality is... the reality is...'). It lacks the poetic cadence or 'legato' passages that Grözinger suggests for deeper aesthetic resonance. It feels more like a highly polished lecture than a musical performance. The rhythm is steady and reliable, which aids clarity, but it rarely 'soars' or uses silence and pacing to create a sense of the 'holy happening' until the very end.",

        "Scattering gathers, and gathering scatters.",

        "Vary sentence structure more to avoid a monotonous 'teaching' cadence.",

        "Use more staccato sentences for emphasis during the 'day of wrath' section."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Distinctly oral language. It is designed for delivery, with frequent 'you see' and 'let me tell you' markers."
    },
    "average_score_language": 6.67,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic. It prioritizes clarity, precision, and the 'translation' of ancient concepts into modern psychological frameworks. While it lacks high-poetic musicality or cinematic imagery, it excels in 'stewardship of the word' by refusing to use jargon lazily. The aesthetic power lies in the 'sharpness' of the definitions rather than the 'beauty' of the prose. It is a teaching-oriented poetics that values the 'aha!' moment of intellectual clarity over the 'wow' moment of sensory immersion."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Lowry-esque' plot: it begins with a common experience (Christmas giving), introduces a 'stasis-shattering' insight (money as a power), and moves through a diagnostic phase before reaching the Christological resolution. The 'upsetting of the equilibrium' occurs when the preacher redefines 'wicked' and 'righteous,' challenging the hearer's self-image. There is a palpable movement from the 'problem' of money's power to the 'solution' of the cross. However, the structure is quite symmetrical (1. What, 2. Why, 3. How), which can feel a bit predictable. The energy peaks at the description of the cross, which serves as the 'climax' of the narrative arc before the practical application.",
      "quotes": [
        "We’re going to learn three things here... great power over us, why it exercises it, and how to break it.",
        "But that’s not where we go. I’m going to be honest about where we go.",

        "The 'three-point' structure is a bit rigid; a more organic narrative flow could increase tension.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 9,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic achievement. The 'reframing' (Cilliers) of Proverbs for a modern, likely affluent, urban audience is seamless. The preacher connects 'dishonest scales' to 'accounting practices' and 'fortified cities' to 'socioeconomic status' with surgical precision. The synthesis of the ancient wisdom of Proverbs with modern psychological insights into identity and shame is profound. It does not simply 'apply' the text; it allows the text to 'read' the modern hearer. The 'reframing' of money as an 'identity-marker' rather than just a 'medium of exchange' offers a completely new lens for the audience to view their bank accounts.",
      "quotes": [
        "We usually use accounting... misleading and outright deceptive accounting practices.",
        "The reality is you’ve done better financially... but your heart says you are better than other people.",
        "It’s the fig leaves. That is, we use money to give ourselves an identity."

        "Could include more specific 'contextual' examples of community-building (e.g., local urban issues).",
        "The 'book vs. clothes' example is good but could be supplemented with a more 'weighty' contextual struggle.",
        "Ensure the 'Macedonian' context is explained as vividly as the modern one."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strongly present. The sermon completely reframes money from a 'resource' to a 'rival god' and 'identity-anchor'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Aesthetically, the sermon leans toward 'closedness.' While it is intellectually stimulating, it functions more as a 'closed system' of truth (Stark) than an 'open work of art.' The preacher provides the diagnosis, the reason, and the solution with such systematic thoroughness that there is little room for the hearer's own 'ambivalence or resistance' to breathe. The ending, while challenging, becomes quite prescriptive with 'two rules of thumb' and specific percentages. It approaches the hearer as a student to be taught rather than a participant in a mystery. While the 'Space for Grace' is opened theologically, the structural form remains monovalent and didactic.",
      "quotes": [
        "In a sense, we’re going to learn three things here.",
        "The first question is... The answer always is...",
        "I would suggest two rules of thumb."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Theological clarity provides a 'safe' structure for the hearer.",
        "The invitation to 'take the cross into the center' is a powerful call to action.",
        "Acknowledges the 'effort' and 'breath-taking' nature of giving, which validates the hearer's struggle."

      "improvement_points": [
        "End with more 'open' questions that allow the hearer to sit with the mystery of grace.",
        "Reduce the 'rules of thumb' at the end to allow the 'scattering' principle to work more imaginatively.",
        "Allow for more 'polyphony'—acknowledge different ways people might experience the 'power' of money."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Monovalent/Closed. It is a 'teaching' sermon that seeks to convince and direct rather than evoke and invite."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are dominated by a strong, logical 'reframing' of reality. The sermon is a well-constructed journey from the surface of culture to the depths of the heart, culminating in a dramatic Christological resolution. Its strength lies in the 'integration' of text and context, creating a powerful 'Aha!' moment. Its aesthetic limitation is its 'closedness'—it is so systematically complete that it risks leaving the hearer as a passive recipient of a perfect argument rather than an active participant in an open-ended encounter with grace."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'cheap comfort' and 'happy endings.' Instead, it confronts the 'day of wrath' and the 'abomination' of greed with sobering honesty. The preacher does not offer a 'five steps to prosperity' plan; he offers a 'scattering' that looks like death. The use of the cross is not sentimentalized but presented as a 'splintering' and 'crunching' reality. The 'book/clothes' example is a moment of authentic self-disclosure that avoids the 'perfect preacher' cliché. By taking the 'pain of suffering' and the 'shame of the heart' seriously, it achieves authentic aesthetic depth.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'mining for nuggets' metaphor is slightly clichéd/kitsch-adjacent.",
      "The 'Christmas is coming' opening is a bit conventional, though quickly subverted."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'day of wrath' as the day of betrayal or fatal disease.",
      "The visceral description of Christ being 'scattered' on the cross.",
      "The admission that 'it takes your breath away a little bit' to give money away."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the 'sharpness' of the psychological diagnosis to keep the 'comfort' from becoming sentimental."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened primarily through the 'reframing' of the cross as the 'ultimate wealth distribution.' The sermon moves beyond moralism ('you must give') to a 'Space for Grace' ('look at what was given for you'). However, the space is somewhat narrowed at the very end by the 'rules of thumb' and the 10% discussion, which pulls the hearer back into a 'calculative' frame of mind. The 'mystery' of how grace transforms a heart is explained quite logically, which provides clarity but perhaps limits the 'wonder.' Nevertheless, by sustaining the tension between 'idolatry' and 'identity,' the sermon creates a genuine clearing for the Holy Spirit to work.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between the 'fortified city' of money and the 'tower' of God is sustained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "Partially; the preacher tends to 'explain' the mystery of the heart's workings rather than leaving it as a 'holy' unknown.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails as the 'power' that breaks the 'power' of money, though moralization reappears in the practical application.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'scattering' metaphor to remain more 'mysterious' and less 'mathematical' in the final application."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high-quality example of 'Sober-Reformed' aesthetics, where beauty is found in the 'clarity of truth' and the 'precision of diagnosis.' It excels in Domain B (Structure), particularly in the 'reframing' of ancient wisdom for a contemporary audience. The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long) and a 'diagnostician' of the heart. While the 'Poetics of Language' (Domain A) are functional rather than artistic, the 'stewardship of language' is exemplary. The sermon avoids kitsch by refusing to offer easy solutions, instead pointing to the 'scattering' of Christ as the only authentic response to the 'power' of money. It creates a 'Space for Grace' by shifting the focus from the hearer's 'duty' to Christ's 'sacrifice,' though it remains a 'closed work' due to its highly didactic and systematic structure.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of biblical concepts (righteousness, fortified city) for a modern psychological context.",
      "Authentic, non-sentimental Christology that connects the 'scattering' of the cross to the 'generosity' of the believer.",
      "High precision and stewardship of language, avoiding religious jargon and platitudes."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase 'openness' by ending with more evocative questions rather than prescriptive 'rules of thumb.'",
      "Incorporate more 'cinematic' imagery in the 'teaching' sections to balance the abstract analysis.",
      "Vary the rhythmic cadence to move beyond the 'lecture' feel and create more 'liturgical' or 'poetic' space."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Academic-Pastoral",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Witness' model of Thomas Long, with the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson appearing in the Christological climax.",
    "audience_analysis": "Professionals, intellectuals, and urban dwellers who value logical clarity, psychological depth, and the 'demythologizing' of religious jargon.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer in the 'Space for Grace' without immediate 'how-to' steps.",
      "Use more 'show, don't tell' in the diagnostic sections (e.g., describe a person looking at their bank account rather than explaining 'security').",
      "Incorporate a moment of 'poetic pause' or 'legato' prose to allow the weight of the 'day of wrath' to settle."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust 'event' that succeeds through intellectual 'reframing' and theological 'precision.' It is a model of how to handle 'Canaanite' language by translating it into 'human' experience. While it lacks the 'openness' of a work of art or the 'musicality' of a poetic sermon, its 'sober beauty' lies in its honesty and its refusal to engage in religious kitsch. It effectively opens a space for the 'Holy' by pointing to the radical 'scattering' of God in Christ as the only power capable of deconstructing the 'fortified cities' of the human heart."
