    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates strong exegetical competence, particularly in the structural linking of Exodus 17 and Psalm 95. The 'Sache' is the reliability of God in the face of scarcity. The preacher avoids dry intellectualism by transposing the historical 'water' into a contemporary 'wilderness' of anxiety. However, the move from the concrete material reality of the Exodus text to the metaphorical 'eternal life' of John 4 is executed with such speed that the tension between physical need and spiritual satisfaction is somewhat flattened. The theological depth is found in the Barthian insistence that God is the subject who provides 'Yes from No'. The clarity is high, though the complexity of the Psalm 95 'negative turn' requires more careful dogmatic unpacking than the 'God doesn't like to be tested' summary provided.",
      "quotes": [
        "The focus is upon their deep need and upon the way in which the deepest question of faith is connected to the deepest material reality of life.",
        "The narrative is one of not trusting God and making material gifts the measure of God’s godness.",
        "Water is sign and symbol that in Jesus we are given a new quality of life."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent intertextual connections between Law, Prophets, and Gospel.",

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The use of cultural references (My Fair Lady) anchors the abstraction."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a personality that is intellectually rigorous yet deeply concerned with the socio-political climate (U.S. context of fear/violence). There is a controlled authenticity; the 'I' is present primarily as an observer of the human condition rather than a vulnerable participant. The self-revelation is 'diaconal' in that it serves the text, but there is a slight 'leaking' of intellectual superiority in the critique of consumerism. The preacher appears as a reliable guide who has thought deeply about the 'thin places', yet the personal 'thirst' of the preacher remains largely hidden behind the 'we' of the congregation.",
      "quotes": [
        "I suspect that those of us who trust the Gospel are deeply torn...",
        "I don’t know what you noticed as we heard Psalm 95.",
        "The list of broken cisterns we have dug for ourselves is long and obvious."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Schizoid. The preacher values structural correctness and theological distance. There is a clear need for order and 'correct' interpretation of the story's movement, with a slight distance from raw emotional display.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is largely subservient, used mostly to facilitate the congregation's movement through the texts.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching' and 'Solidary'. The preacher uses the inclusive 'we' to soften the blow of the critique of 'cracked cisterns'. However, there is a paternalistic undertone in the way the preacher directs the listener's attention ('Listen for all three', 'Well, they should have left it there'). The 'Yellow' side is somewhat cool; it assumes a congregation that is willing to be led through a three-point academic extrapolation. There is little 'relationship noise' in terms of aggression, but the tone is one of a professor lecturing a familiar class rather than a fellow traveler in the desert.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily to 'notice and choose again'. The preacher successfully avoids crude moralism by grounding the 'Anspruch' (demand) in the 'Zuspruch' (the Big Yes of God). However, the third point of the sermon shifts heavily into the 'Red' side, listing consumerist sins. While theologically sound, the pressure on the 'dutiful listener' increases here. The 'Big Yes' of the second section is the theological engine, but the sermon ends on a note of 'yearning' and 'choosing', which places the final weight back on the human subject's decision. The Barthian 'Acting Subject' (God) is prominent in the middle, but the human 'choosing' dominates the end.",
      "quotes": [
        "Lent is a time for noticing and choosing again...",

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The 'Zuspruch' is the foundation, but the 'Anspruch' (choosing the right well) takes the final word.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Moderate. The critique of 'sex, money, power' is standard but can feel like a law-heavy checklist.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a solid, homiletically competent sermon that excels in its 'Blue' (factual) and 'Green' (self-revelation) congruence. The preacher avoids the common pitfall of 'cheap grace' by including the difficult 'negative' turn of Psalm 95, though this creates a psychological tension that the 'Yellow' (relational) side doesn't fully soothe. Theologically, it follows a Barthian trajectory by emphasizing God's 'Yes' as an objective reality in Christ that precedes human response. However, the transition to the 'Red' (appeal) side in the final third risks overshadowing the 'Gift' with a list of 'cracked cisterns'. The psychological profile is one of a 'Compulsive' teacher—orderly, text-focused, and slightly distant. While the sermon is intellectually stimulating and theologically 'correct', it lacks the 'exceptional' quality of a 9-10 because it remains largely in the realm of teaching rather than becoming a performative event of the 'Yes' it proclaims.",
    "barthian_warning": "Low risk. The preacher maintains God as the 'Acting Subject' who strikes the rock, though the ending leans slightly toward human 'choosing'.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Rigorous intertextual structure.",
      "Avoidance of superficial moralism in the definition of Lent.",
      "Strong Christological focus (the 'Big Yes')."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Increase relational warmth to balance the intellectual critique.",
      "Resolve the tension between God's 'Yes' and God's 'Loathing' more clearly.",
      "End with the Promise (Zuspruch) rather than the human 'Yearning'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A highly satisfactory, professional sermon that serves the text with integrity but maintains a safe, academic distance."
