    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating concrete human analogies to bridge the gap between abstract dogma (the Trinity) and lived experience. The opening 'parent of a self-destructing child' is a powerful, visceral image that anchors the theological concept of 'self-giving love.' However, the imagery remains largely within the realm of psychological or relational scenarios rather than sensory 'painting.' While it avoids 'dead metaphors,' it leans heavily on the 'parental' archetype. The second section on Psalm 130 uses the 'watchman' image effectively, though it remains closer to the biblical text's own imagery than generating new, surprising metaphors. It follows Wilson's 'show, don't tell' by starting with a scene rather than a definition.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise, reflecting McEntyre's 'stewardship of language.' The preacher avoids 'Canaanite' jargon, or where theological terms are used (e.g., 'Trinitarian formula', 'valedictory blessings'), they are contextualized through the narrative of Paul’s desperation. There is a clear effort to reclaim 'lost' language, such as 'miserable offenders' and 'no health in us,' not as archaic relics but as precise descriptors of the human condition. The word choice is sophisticated yet accessible, avoiding the 'sloppy thinking' Grözinger warns against. The distinction between 'Something' and 'Someone' in the Trinity section is a mark of high linguistic care.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a dignified, liturgical rhythm. There is a clear use of parallelism ('maybe he is... maybe she is... maybe he has...') which builds rhetorical momentum. The cadence is generally 'legato,' suited for reflection, but it occasionally lacks the 'staccato' punch needed for an oral event. It feels slightly more like a 'written essay' (paper language) than a 'spoken performance' in certain sections, particularly the analysis of the Prayer Book. However, the use of the Trinitarian blessing as a recurring motif provides a musical 'refrain' that anchors the structure. The rhythm of the final paragraphs is particularly strong, moving toward a crescendo of assurance.",
      "quotes": [
        "Without restraint, without measure, without calculation, without ceasing.",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by high precision and a sober, 'Reformed-Anglican' beauty. It avoids the fluff of contemporary sentimentality by grounding its imagery in the 'agonized' reality of the human condition. While it occasionally feels more like a written text than a spontaneous oral event, the stewardship of words is evident. The preacher successfully 'reframes' traditional liturgical language, making archaic terms feel urgent and descriptive. The imagery is psychologically resonant, though it could benefit from more diverse sensory engagement beyond the visual-relational sphere."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Lowry-esque' plot. It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' (the desperate parent/the failing church). It introduces a 'knot'—the distance between us and God, and the 'crabbed' nature of Paul's letter. The turning point is the realization that the 'tired formula' of the Trinity is actually a 'desperate' gift of love. The second half (Psalm 130) follows a similar arc from the 'depths' to the 'dawn.' The movement is not a static three-point list but a journey from 'catastrophe' to 'redemption.' However, the transition between the two main sections (Trinity and Psalm 130) feels somewhat disjointed, as if two separate reflections were joined together.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength. The preacher 'reframes' (Cilliers) the biblical text by placing it within the context of modern parental anxiety and the 'messed-up lives' of the congregation. The 'strangeness' of the Trinitarian doctrine is respected by not explaining it away, but by showing its 'performance' in Paul's life. The integration of the Prayer Book controversy serves as a contextual 'clash' that forces the hearer to re-evaluate their own resistance to the word 'sin.' The synthesis between the 'then' of the Corinthian crisis and the 'now' of the hearer’s 'last ditch' is organic and powerful. It respects the 'otherness' of the text while making it hit home.",
      "quotes": [
        "The church that was breaking his heart is the one that gets the full Trinitarian blessing.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is somewhat 'closed' in its theological conclusions, which is characteristic of a 'witness' style (Long). While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (the child who doesn't respond, the 'last ditch' of messed-up lives), the resolution is quite firm. It doesn't leave many 'open questions' for the hearer to wrestle with; instead, it provides a strong, authoritative assurance. According to Stark's 'open work of art,' it might be seen as slightly monovalent—it has one clear message of grace. However, the invitation to 'reflect on your own life' creates a space for the hearer to step in and populate the sermon with their own 'someone' who loved them.",
      "quotes": [
        "Reflect on your own life. Think about those people...",
        "This is not self-abasement leading to paralysis; this is honesty leading to deliverance.",

        "End with a question or a 'lingering' image rather than a definitive 'And so I may leave you...'.",
        "Allow more room for the 'silence' of God in the 'depths' before moving to the 'dawn'.",
        "Avoid the 'May God grant...' formula, which can sound like a 'closed' liturgical wrap-up."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Moderately closed; it functions as a 'witness' that provides a definitive answer to the 'depths'."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon exhibits a strong, purposeful dramaturgy. It moves effectively from human 'depths' to divine 'radiance' using a narrative arc that mirrors the biblical texts. The integration of text and context is superior, particularly in how it rescues 'dry' doctrine and 'archaic' liturgy for a modern audience. While the structure is somewhat 'closed' by its authoritative tone, it creates sufficient 'space for grace' by grounding its theology in the messy, 'crabbed' realities of human relationships. The two-part structure (Trinity/Psalm) is thematic but could be more tightly woven."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It explicitly warns against a 'vague, romanticized version of human love.' By describing Paul's letter as 'crabbed' and 'painful to read,' it avoids the 'beautifying' of the Bible. It takes the 'pain of suffering' and the 'vast primordial catastrophe' of sin seriously, refusing to offer a 'happy ending' that doesn't first go through the 'depths.' The emotion feels authentic because it is tied to 'desperation' and 'self-destruction' rather than 'sentimentality.' The refusal to remove the 'miserable offenders' language is a direct stand against liturgical kitsch.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None present, though the 'parent' analogy could have easily slipped into kitsch if the child's 'self-destruction' was minimized.",

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace precisely by the 'unflinching acknowledgment' of the depths. Cilliers' 'Space for Grace' is created here because the preacher does not use moralism ('you must do better') but 'reframing' ('God is pursuing you'). The sermon sustains the tension between our 'inability' and God's 'plenteous redemption.' It avoids the 'cheap resolution' by insisting that the 'fear of the Lord' is the proper response to forgiveness. The 'mystery' of the Trinity is not 'solved' but 'adored' as a 'dynamic interrelatedness.'",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'miserable offender' and 'beloved child' is held throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "The Trinity remains a 'Someone' who is 'inexhaustible,' not a logical puzzle to be solved.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails decisively; the imperative is 'honesty' and 'trust,' not 'moral performance.'",

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'Sober-Reformed' homiletics with an Anglican liturgical sensibility. Its primary aesthetic power lies in its 'stewardship of language' and its ability to 'reframe' traditional dogmatic and liturgical categories. It avoids the pitfalls of modern religious kitsch by refusing to sentimentalize love or minimize sin. The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long), pointing away from the sermon itself toward the 'incomprehensible majesty' of God. The imagery is effective, particularly in the opening 'parental' analogy, which provides a visceral 'entry point' into the doctrine of the Trinity. While the structure is somewhat traditional and the tone authoritative, it successfully creates a 'space for grace' by insisting on the 'vast primordial catastrophe' of the human condition as the necessary backdrop for the 'radiance' of God's mercy. The movement from 'depths' to 'dawn' is handled with rhetorical skill and theological depth.",

      "Incorporate a 'visual' or 'spatial' metaphor for the Trinity (e.g., dance, light, or architecture) to complement the 'relational' one.",

      "Practice 'staccato' phrasing in the 'proclamation' sections to increase the performative 'event' quality."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically 'strong' (7.5) sermon that demonstrates how traditional theology can be made 'new' through careful language and honest perception. It is a model of how to handle 'sin' and 'grace' without falling into moralism or kitsch. Its beauty is 'sober' rather than 'baroque,' drawing its power from the truth of the human condition and the 'inexhaustible' nature of God. It succeeds in opening a 'space for grace' in a culture of 'vague, romanticized' sentiment."
