    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's first thesis by being a thematic speech rather than an exposition of one specific passage. It jumps between Job, Psalm 104, Psalm 29, and Mark 4. It treats the Bible as a source of 'keywords' or 'themes' (hurricanes/storms) rather than allowing a single pericope to dictate the specific word for the day.",
      "quotes": [

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher shows awareness of the structure of Job and the nature of the 'Thunderstorm Psalm,' but the exegesis is subservient to literary illustrations (Melville, McCullough). There is no evidence of the 'requirement' of Hebrew/Greek or deep theological history of the specific books.",
      "quotes": [
        "This goes on for thirty-seven chapters — talk, talk, talk.",
        "God and the devil have a wager."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part according to Dekker's demand for concreteness. By using the local context of Nantucket, whaling history, and the Johnstown flood, the preacher avoids 'general truths' and addresses the 'zeitgeist' of sentimentalism.",
      "quotes": [
        "I want to read in the context of Nantucket Island",
        "You don’t see any windows of hurricanes or tornadoes in churches",

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon avoids the 'block' structure (first exegesis, then application). It moves fluidly between the biblical text and the contemporary/historical illustrations, drawing the hearer into the 'storm' of the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "In other words, can you, Job, create a storm? ... When we are in landscapes like Nantucket, we tend to feel that we are somehow closer to God."

      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'interweaving' serves the text's own logic rather than the preacher's thematic arc."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon leans heavily into 'misery' (the storm, the insignificance of man) and 'redemption' (Christ in the boat). It successfully avoids a 'too Christocentric' approach by first establishing the 'objective' majesty of the Father.",
      "quotes": [
        "Where were you, O person of infinite insignificance",
        "Heed it well, ye Pantheists!",
        "this God who in Jesus Christ is lying asleep in a boat"

      "improvement_point": "The 'gratitude' part is weak; the ending feels more like a sentimental 'hand-holding' than a robust response of the Spirit-awakened life."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon takes the possibility of being 'lost' seriously. It critiques the 'liberal' tradition (sentimentalism) and emphasizes the 'temporal loss' in the storm as a sign of the 'eternal' majesty of God. It rejects the 'vacation' view of life.",
      "quotes": [
        "nature was merciless",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the 'telos' at the end, and the doctrine of the two natures is implied ('incarnate Creator'). However, the transition from the 'God of Hurricanes' to the 'Man of Galilee' feels abrupt and almost like a 'theme among others' rather than the necessary conclusion of the specific texts used.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus of Nazareth is the incarnate Creator.",
        "It is this contrast between the cosmic might of the Creator God and the suffering of the Messiah on the Cross that makes the Christian story unique."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 18.5 minutes, the sermon falls just short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. While it has 'breadth' in its literary references, it lacks the 'depth' of sustained engagement with a single passage.",
      "improvement_point": "Increase the duration by deepening the linguistic and theological exegesis of one primary text."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's definition primarily because it is a thematic essay rather than a specific scriptural exposition. It treats the Bible as a repository for a 'theme' (storms) and relies too heavily on secular literature (Melville, McCullough) to carry the weight of the message. However, it successfully avoids sentimentalism and takes the majesty of God and the reality of human insignificance (misery) seriously.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong rejection of 'soft' theology and sentimentalism.",
      "Concrete application to the local context (Nantucket/Whaling).",
      "Serious treatment of the 'Two Ways' through the lens of nature's mercilessness."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of a single, specific Bible passage as the foundation.",
      "Insufficient duration and depth of biblical exegesis.",
      "Over-reliance on humanities/literature at the expense of the Word's own specificity."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate theological speech or 'thematic address,' but according to Dekker’s strict formal definition, it is not a sermon because it lacks the recreation of one specific Bible passage into a new, current word."
