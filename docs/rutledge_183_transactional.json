    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'High Parent' homiletics. While theologically rich in its description of the Trinity, it relies heavily on the psychological 'put-down' to make the 'lift-up' feel effective. By insisting on the phrase 'there is no health in us,' the preacher reinforces a shame-based identity (Adapted Child) as the only valid entry point for spirituality. This creates a cycle where the listener must feel 'bad' to feel 'God.'",

      "Heavy reliance on 'shame-logic' to highlight grace.",
      "Pushes the listener into a permanent 'Victim' role within the Drama Triangle."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as 'Adults' who are capable of choosing the good, rather than 'Children' who are fundamentally 'unhealthy.' Frame grace as an empowerment for autonomy (Free Child) rather than just a rescue from wretchedness (Adapted Child)."
