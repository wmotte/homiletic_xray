    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon relies heavily on pop-psychology lists and contemporary references rather than vivid biblical imagery. While the preacher attempts to 'paint' the scene of Peter at the shore, the language remains largely functional. There is a missed opportunity to evoke the sensory details of the 'charcoal fire' or the 'smell of fish' mentioned in the source text. The imagery of the 'circus' and 'Duchenne Heroes' provides some visual grounding, but these are anecdotal rather than theological metaphors. According to Paul Scott Wilson's 'show, don't tell' rule, the sermon 'tells' the emotional state of Peter more than it 'shows' it through evocative language.",

        "Use more 'living metaphors' instead of clichés like 'het hart op de juiste plek'."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Predominantly 'telling'. The preacher explains Peter's feelings and the 'heart' as a concept rather than letting the narrative details evoke the emotion."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The language is very informal, bordering on sloppy ('Nou', 'Oké', 'schijnt het', 'dingen'). While this aids accessibility, it lacks the 'stewardship of language' McEntyre advocates for. The use of 'onderzoekjes' (researches) is vague and lacks precision, serving more as a rhetorical hook than a careful foundation. The theological terminology is sparse, which avoids 'Canaanite jargon' but also risks thinning out the depth of the message. The transition from 'women's skills' to 'Peter's heart' feels somewhat forced and lacks linguistic nuance.",
      "quotes": [
        "En schijnt ook te zijn dat hun hersenen anders bedraad zijn dan mannen.",

        "Avoid repetitive phrasing like 'ik heb ontdekt' to allow the Word to speak more autonomously."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Very low jargon. The language is secular-conversational, which is clear but lacks the 'sacred' precision of traditional homiletics."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The rhythm is that of a natural conversation or a 'TED-talk'. It has a staccato pace with many short sentences and rhetorical questions. This makes it very 'oral' (not paper language), which is a strength for an event-based sermon (Immink). However, it lacks poetic cadence or 'legato' moments of reflection. The repetition of 'Hoe gaat het écht met je?' creates a rhythmic pulse in the second half, but the first half feels like a fragmented list of observations.",
      "quotes": [
        "Hoe gaat het met je? Ja, goed hoor. Ja, maar hoe gaat het écht met je?",
        "Iedere ochtend als er een haan kraaide, wat dacht Petrus dan? Aan: 'Ik heb Jezus verlogen.'",

      ],

        "Incorporate more alliteration or parallelism to make key points more memorable.",
        "Create 'poetic rest points' where the language slows down to allow the 'Space for Grace'."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Pure oral language. It is clearly a transcript of a spoken address, lacking any 'bureaucratic' or 'paper' stiffness."
    },
    "average_score_language": 4.67,
    "summary_language": "The language is highly accessible and conversational, successfully avoiding religious jargon. However, it lacks aesthetic 'stewardship' and precision. The reliance on informal fillers and vague 'research' references reduces the poetic weight of the sermon. It functions well as a communication event but lacks the 'sober beauty' or metaphorical depth found in higher-scoring homiletic art. It is 'talk-like' rather than 'proclamation-like'."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear, albeit somewhat disjointed, arc. It starts with a 'hook' (women vs. men), moves to the 'trouble' (Peter's failure and trauma), and concludes with the 'grace' (Jesus' restoration). The use of the 'three questions' creates a crescendo toward the 'heart'. However, the transition from the humorous intro about women's multitasking to Peter's bitter weeping is a bit jarring. The 'upsetting of equilibrium' happens when the preacher asks if the listener has ever cried over their own failure, which is a strong dramaturgical moment.",
      "quotes": [
        "Nou, vandaag denken we na over een van die dingen waar vrouwen beter in zijn.",
        "En aan al dat bravoer van Petrus komt dan een eind in de hof van Gethsemane.",
        "We gaan gewoon eindigen, jongens. We gaan gaan bidden met elkaar."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The connection between the 'three questions' of Jesus and the 'three questions' in modern pastoral care is a strong structural move.",
        "Good use of 'delay'—the preacher builds up to the third question where the emotion finally breaks through.",
        "The 'trauma' of the rooster (EMDR reference) adds a modern psychological tension to the old story."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The intro is too long (nearly 30% of the text) before reaching the biblical text.",
        "The conclusion is somewhat abrupt ('We gaan gewoon eindigen, jongens'), losing the accumulated tension.",
        "Better integrate the 'Year Theme' earlier so it doesn't feel like a last-minute addition."

      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey that moves from social observation to psychological trauma to spiritual restoration."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher makes a bold attempt at 'reframing' (Cilliers) by viewing Peter's denial through the lens of modern trauma and EMDR. This bridges the 'then' and 'now' effectively. The mention of Mark Overmars and Ajax is a risky but effective way to illustrate 'falling back into old patterns'. However, the integration of the 'women are better at X' theme with Peter's story feels slightly stereotypical and gender-essentialist, which might create 'resistance' (Stark) in some hearers rather than opening the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ik kan mij ook in deze tijd voorstellen dat Petrus EMDR nodig gehad zou hebben.",
        "Dat is ook de reden waarom Ajax Mark Overmars terug wil.",
        "En ik heb ontdekt dat de meeste vrouwen daar veel beter in zijn dan mannen."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The 'Mark Overmars' analogy is a very sharp, contemporary way to explain the theological concept of 'returning to the old life'.",
        "The psychological 'reframing' of the rooster's crow as a trauma trigger is insightful.",
        "The application to the 'Year Theme' (courage to show the heart) is practical."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Avoid over-generalizing gender roles, as it can distract from the universal theological point.",
        "Connect the 'multitasking' and 'color perception' more deeply to the text, or leave them out if they remain superficial.",
        "Let the biblical text 'reframe' the context more than the context 'explaining' the text."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes, particularly through the lens of trauma and the 'old patterns' of the Ajax/Overmars analogy."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is relatively 'closed' in its application. It moves toward a specific 'challenge' (show your heart). While it acknowledges that for some this is 'impossible' or 'sad', it still pushes toward a moral imperative for the new year. According to Ciska Stark's 'Open Work of Art', this sermon leans more toward a 'monovalent' message: 'be like the restored Peter/be like a woman who communicates well'. The ending prayer, however, does open some space by acknowledging those who find the message difficult.",
      "quotes": [
        "Daarvoor wil ik jullie uitdagen dit nieuwe jaar. Durf naar elkaar je hart te laten zien.",
        "Maar ook daarin heb ik wel ontdekt... dat soms een heel klein stapje aan een enorme overwinning kan zijn.",
        "God, voor de ene vanzelfsprekend en voor de ander juist dat duwtje in de rug."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The preacher acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' by mentioning those who cannot reach their heart.",
        "The 'three questions' structure allows the hearer to place themselves in the position of the questioned.",
        "The prayer is inclusive of different emotional states."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Leave more 'unanswered' questions at the end to stimulate further reflection.",
        "Avoid the 'challenge' format which can feel like a 'closed' moralistic task.",
        "Allow the mystery of Jesus' grace to stand without immediately turning it into a 'communication tip'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Leans toward closed/moralistic, though softened by pastoral sensitivity in the prayer."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 5.67,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is engaging and follows a clear narrative path. The use of contemporary analogies (Ajax, EMDR) is effective for 'reframing' the biblical narrative. However, the sermon suffers from an over-extended introduction and a tendency to close the 'Open Work of Art' with a specific moral challenge. The dramaturgy is functional but lacks the 'sacred suspense' that would elevate it to a higher aesthetic level."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon narrowly avoids 'religious kitsch' by taking Peter's failure and trauma seriously. The mention of 'bitter tears' and 'EMDR' prevents a 'cheap happy ending'. However, the gender-based clichés in the introduction flirt with 'kitsch' by using pre-chewed social stereotypes to generate easy rapport. The 'authentic aesthetic depth' is found in the middle section where the preacher discusses the pain of falling back into old patterns. The ending is slightly sentimental ('echte helden'), but the pastoral acknowledgement of those who 'can't get there' provides a necessary anchor in reality.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The list of 'what women do better' (stereotypical sentiment).",
      "The 'heroes' terminology for the year theme (cliché)."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The analysis of the rooster's crow as a recurring trauma trigger.",
      "The recognition that some people sit with 'verdriet' because they cannot reach their own heart."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Avoid the 'Reader's Digest' style lists in the introduction. Deepen the 'authentic' by staying longer in the silence of Peter's failure before moving to the 'communication' solution."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened through the depiction of Jesus' persistence. By showing that Jesus asks three times—not to annoy, but to reach the heart—the preacher illustrates a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers). However, this space is partially closed by the subsequent 'moralization' of the message into a 'Year Theme' task. The tension between 'Peter the failure' and 'Peter the leader' is sustained well, but the mystery of the divine encounter is somewhat flattened by the psychological explanation of 'heart-connection'.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension of Peter's failure is sustained well through the EMDR/trauma analogy.",
    "mystery_respected": "Partially; the 'heart' is explained more as a psychological center than a mystical one.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the description of Jesus' approach, but moralization takes over in the final challenge.",
    "recommendation": "End with the wonder of Jesus' 'Ik hou van jou' rather than the congregation's 'Durf je hart te laten zien'."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 5.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a clear example of the 'Low-Threshold/Communicative' style. Aesthetically, it prioritizes 'Inter-esse' (Cilliers)—the space between the ancient text and the modern hearer—using contemporary analogies like Ajax and EMDR to make the text 'perceivable'. Its strength lies in its oral accessibility and psychological relatability. However, from a 'Poetics of Language' perspective, it is thin. The language is functional and informal, lacking the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed tradition or the 'cinematic imagery' of the New Homiletic. It functions more as an effective 'pastoral talk' than a 'work of art'. The 'Aesthetic Turn' is present in the attempt to 'reframe' reality, but the execution is hampered by linguistic clichés and a somewhat moralistic conclusion.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Effective 'reframing' of Peter's denial as a modern trauma/EMDR scenario.",
      "Strong 'oral' quality that creates a direct, unpretentious connection with the audience.",
      "Honest pastoral sensitivity regarding emotional limitations."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Elevate the 'stewardship of language' by reducing fillers and gender clichés.",
      "Balance 'showing' vs 'telling' by using more sensory biblical imagery.",
      "Allow the 'Space for Grace' to remain open at the end rather than closing it with a moral task."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Conversational-Psychological",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Theo Pleizier (religious involvement/empirical) and Paul Scott Wilson (Four Pages structure), but lacks the 'Open Work' quality of Ciska Stark.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to a modern, perhaps unchurched or 'searcher' audience that values authenticity and psychological insight over liturgical tradition.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a 'sober' introduction that starts directly with a sensory image from the text.",
      "Use one deep metaphor throughout the sermon rather than a list of small anecdotes.",
      "Read the text aloud during preparation to identify and remove 'paper language' and fillers."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is aesthetically 'sufficient' (5.5) for its specific communicative context but does not reach the level of 'homiletic art'. It succeeds in making the biblical narrative relevant through contemporary 'reframing', but fails to provide a rich, polyvalent experience due to its informal language and moralistic closure. It is a functional, pastoral address that prioritizes 'clarity' over 'beauty'."
