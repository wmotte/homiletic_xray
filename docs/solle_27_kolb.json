    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is exceptionally strong in facilitating concrete experience. It avoids abstract 'everyman' scenarios in favor of vivid, specific narratives. By starting with a detailed account of a Californian congregation, the hearers are immediately drawn into a lived reality. The emotional connection is established through stories of refugees, marginalized groups, and the physical reality of illness (breast cancer rates). The hearer is not just told about the church; they are shown a 'slice of life' that feels authentic and recognizable.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ein Mann aus El Salvador, etwa Ende fünfzig, erzählte von seiner Verhaftung, Trennung von der Familie, Folterung...",

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Reflection is facilitated through a critical analysis of the human condition and church structures. The sermon pauses to ask 'why' the church feels alien to many and 'why' the Eucharist has become a place of fear or symbolic emptiness. It offers a cultural critique of modern individualism and the 'single' experience in the church. However, it sometimes moves quickly from observation to political judgment without allowing the hearer to dwell long in the tension of the question.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The theological exposition is solid, particularly in the social-historical exegesis of the Corinthian conflict. The 'big idea' is the intrinsic link between holiness and justice (solidarity). The sermon successfully reclaims the Jewish roots of the Eucharist. While it avoids academic jargon, it provides a clear theological framework: the 'Body of Christ' as a social reality rather than a mystical abstraction. The exegesis of 'unworthy' is a key conceptual shift.",

It offers specific liturgical suggestions (more food, more prayer). However, the leap from the 'Body of Christ' to 'global debt' might feel overwhelming for an individual hearer. The 'how' is clear on a macro-level (political pressure) but slightly less clear on a micro-level for the average congregant's daily life, aside from 'sharing food'.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of experiential homiletics that prioritizes narrative and socio-political reflection. It effectively breaks down the barrier between 'sacred' ritual and 'secular' reality. The use of specific, concrete stories (Palo Alto, Sauda) ensures that the 'Concrete Experience' phase is well-developed. The exegesis of 1 Corinthians 11 is handled with academic rigor but translated into accessible social terms, fulfilling the 'Abstract Conceptualization' phase. However, the sermon is slightly imbalanced, leaning heavily on the 'Accommodating' and 'Diverging' learning styles. The 'Active Experimentation' phase, while present, focuses on large-scale political shifts (Jubilee 2000) which may leave the individual hearer feeling somewhat disconnected from their own immediate agency. The dialogue format between Sölle and Schottroff adds a layer of 'Reflective Observation' as they model the process of thinking through the text together.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a robust application of Kolb's cycle, particularly excelling in the 'Concrete Experience' and 'Reflective Observation' quadrants. It successfully moves the hearer from a recognizable human situation (loneliness/church-alienation) through a theological re-framing of the text, toward a vision of a more just world. While the 'Active Experimentation' is somewhat macro-focused, the sermon remains a strong model for 'Visionary' and 'Narrative' preaching. Its priority for improvement lies in balancing the political 'Prophetic' voice with a more 'Priestly' guidance for the individual's daily walk of solidarity."
