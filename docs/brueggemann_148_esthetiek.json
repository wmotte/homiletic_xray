    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with strong cosmic imagery derived from Psalm 98, effectively linking the 'rush of the Spirit' to the movement of creation. However, as the sermon transitions into the political and ecclesiastical 'reframing,' the imagery becomes more conceptual and sociological. While the preacher mentions 'porcupines and carrots,' these function more as whimsical lists than deep metaphors. The 'show, don't tell' principle is applied well in the first half (the nightmare of Peter), but the second half relies heavily on 'telling' the characteristics of liberals and conservatives. The imagery serves to ground the theological argument but lacks the sensory depth found in more poetic homiletics.",
      "quotes": [
        "The sea, the flood, the hills... porcupines and carrots and zebras together in praise.",
        "The Holy Spirit was poured out on Gentiles who were swept up in the rush of God’s newness.",
        "Peter, the leader of them all, will soon have a nightmare in which he argues with God."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably clear and avoids dense 'Canaanite' jargon, opting instead for a direct, almost conversational tone. The preacher exhibits 'stewardship of language' by precisely naming the prejudices of both sides of the political spectrum without being inflammatory. The use of the word 'astonished' acts as a recurring anchor, providing a precise emotional center for the text. There is a deliberate attempt to do justice to the 'nuance of human experience' by mirroring the internal monologues of both conservatives and liberals. However, the repetition of 'cradle' (cradle conservative/liberal) borders on a rhetorical crutch rather than a precise descriptor.",
      "quotes": [
        "They are soft on foreign policy and want to sing kumbaya in the face of real danger.",
        "They see taxes as income redistribution and not as an act of neighborly compassion.",

      "jargon_analysis": "Very low jargon; theological terms like 'profane' and 'clean' are defined through the narrative context."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a strong oral cadence, characterized by parallelism and rhythmic repetition. The 'Baptism wins' refrain at the end creates a staccato, percussive finish that would be highly effective in performance. The sentence structures are generally short and punchy, avoiding 'paper language.' The mirroring of the two political sections creates a liturgical rhythm—a call and response between the two 'tribes' of the congregation. While not 'poetic' in a traditional sense, the rhetorical flow is purposeful and builds toward a crescendo of unity.",
      "quotes": [
        "Baptism wins out. Baptism wins out over liberalism and over conservatism.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The middle section is somewhat repetitive in its structure; a variation in sentence length could prevent a 'sing-song' effect.",

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Distinctly oral language; designed for the ear and the moment of delivery."
    },
    "average_score_language": 6.67,
    "summary_language": "The sermon's language is characterized by a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that prioritizes clarity and rhetorical impact over baroque decoration. It excels in its use of parallelism and rhythmic repetition to dismantle political silos. While the imagery is somewhat sparse in the middle sections, the use of a biblical refrain ('What God called clean...') provides a strong linguistic anchor. The precision in naming contemporary anxieties demonstrates a high level of 'stewardship of language,' making the theological claims feel grounded and urgent rather than abstract or academic."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a sophisticated 'Lowry Loop' or narrative plot. It begins with the equilibrium of creation's praise, introduces the 'upsetting' conflict of the Gentile admission in Acts, and then masterfully maps this ancient tension onto the contemporary 'red/blue' divide. The turning point is the realization that the Spirit 'settles down where we would not wish it.' The movement from the 'tribal' mindset to the 'baptized' identity provides a clear and satisfying resolution. The energy does not drop; rather, it intensifies as the preacher challenges the 'safe comfort zones' of the hearers.",
      "quotes": [
        "Gentiles, you know, were unwelcome outsiders who wanted in on the gospel.",
        "Imagine if you are a cradle conservative... Or you can spin it the other way.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. It perfectly exemplifies Cilliers' concept of 'reframing.' By placing the modern political divide within the frame of the Jewish-Gentile conflict of the first century, the preacher allows the congregation to see their own 'pet convictions' through a new lens. The integration is organic; the biblical text isn't just a springboard but the actual 'mirror' in which the contemporary situation is reflected. The 'strangeness' of the Spirit's work in Acts is used to highlight the 'strangeness' of being a Christian in a polarized world.",
      "quotes": [
        "The story of the church is the story of insiders finding compelling ways to welcome outsiders.",
        "The church is reflective in crucial ways of the deep tension between Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell.",
        "Baptism as an identity is more important and decisive than our conservative or liberal ideology."

      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of political identity as secondary to baptismal identity.",
        "Honors the radicality of the biblical text (Acts 10) by applying it to high-stakes modern issues.",
        "Avoids 'moralizing' the text by focusing on the 'event' of the Spirit's arrival."

      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing present; reality is viewed through the lens of the Spirit's 'unclean' choices."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is rhetorically powerful, it leans toward a 'closed' structure in its conclusion. The refrain 'Baptism wins' is a declarative, almost dogmatic resolution. While it opens space for the 'other,' it doesn't leave much room for the hearer to interpret what that 'winning' looks like in practice. It is a 'monovalent' message: unity through baptism. However, it respects the 'ambivalence of existence' by acknowledging that we still have our 'cradle passions.' It approaches the hearer as a mature partner by not telling them to *stop* being conservative or liberal, but to *reframe* those identities.",
      "quotes": [
        "Any who want the church to be safely liberal or safely conservative does not get it.",
        "We are together more odd in the world than any of our ideologies.",
        "Called out beyond our safe comfort zone!"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the persistence of 'cradle passions' rather than demanding their immediate erasure.",
        "Invites the hearer into a 'more odd' identity.",
        "The ending is an invitation to 'wonder' in the Easter season."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The conclusion 'Baptism wins' could be followed by an open question to allow for more 'appropriation' by the hearer.",
        "Avoid the phrase 'does not get it,' which can feel coercive or dismissive.",
        "Leave more room for the 'resistance' that the hearer might feel toward the 'other'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A mix of monovalent declaration and polyvalent invitation; leans toward a closed rhetorical victory."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is highly effective, utilizing a narrative arc that moves from cosmic praise to tribal conflict and finally to a unified identity. The integration of the Acts narrative with modern political polarization is a masterclass in 'reframing,' making the ancient text feel immediate and dangerous. While the conclusion is rhetorically 'closed' with its repetitive 'Baptism wins' refrain, the overall movement of the sermon creates a significant 'space for grace' by challenging the hearer's self-constructed boundaries."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully avoids religious kitsch by refusing to offer 'cheap comfort' or 'happy endings' that ignore the reality of conflict. It does not pretend that the tension between Reid and McConnell (or their followers) is easily resolved. By using the word 'astonished' and 'nightmare,' the preacher acknowledges the genuine pain and 'defilement' felt when boundaries are crossed. There is an authentic aesthetic depth in the recognition that the Spirit's work is 'risky' and 'daring.' It avoids the 'kitsch' of a sentimental 'unity' by grounding that unity in the 'oddness' of baptism rather than a 'kumbaya' feeling.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The brief mention of 'singing kumbaya' is used as a critique of kitsch, though the list of 'porcupines and carrots' borders on a whimsical kitsch if not handled carefully.",
      "The 'happy ending' of 'Baptism wins' could be seen as a rhetorical shortcut if the preceding tension wasn't so well-established."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'nightmare' of Peter and the genuine fear of being 'defiled' by the other.",
      "The honest admission that we 'would prefer a Christ who is just like us.'"
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the focus on the 'astonishment' and 'risk' to ensure the conclusion doesn't feel like a pre-chewed emotional resolution."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens a significant 'space for grace' by displacing the human ego (and its political ideologies) from the center of the church's life. By emphasizing that the Spirit 'settles down where we would not wish it,' the preacher creates room for the 'unavailable' and the 'mystery' of God's action. Grace is presented not as a moral task but as an 'event' (the pouring out of the Spirit) that overrides human categories. However, the space is slightly constricted by the heavy rhetorical mirroring, which can feel like a 'trap' for the hearer, forcing them into a pre-designed synthesis.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained through the mirroring of the two political sides, though the conclusion seeks to resolve them through the 'identity' of baptism.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'mystery' of the Spirit's choice is central, though the explanation of political motives is very 'un-mysterious.'",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; baptism is presented as a 'seal' and a 'gift' rather than a moral achievement.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'oddness' of the baptized life to remain a bit more mysterious and less 'mapped' out."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'Reframing Homiletics.' Its primary strength lies in its macro-aesthetic structure—the way it weaves the biblical narrative of Acts 10 into the contemporary fabric of a polarized society. The preacher avoids the 'kitsch' of easy reconciliation by honoring the genuine 'astonishment' and 'resistance' that the Spirit’s work evokes. The language is 'sober-Reformed,' prioritizing rhetorical clarity and oral cadence over poetic flourish. While the imagery is effective, particularly in the cosmic opening, the sermon’s power is derived more from its dramaturgical movement and its ability to create a 'space for grace' by challenging the hearer’s primary identities. It successfully moves the hearer from a 'tribal' perspective to a 'baptismal' one, making the gospel feel like an 'event' rather than a mere set of instructions. The conclusion, while rhetorically 'closed,' serves as a powerful percussive seal on the sermon’s central argument.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of modern political polarization through the lens of Acts 10.",
      "Strong oral rhythm and parallelism that sustains engagement.",
      "Authentic avoidance of religious kitsch by respecting the 'risk' of the Spirit's work."

      "Increase sensory imagery in the contemporary application sections.",
      "Soften the 'closed' nature of the conclusion to allow for more hearer appropriation.",

    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Four Pages/Trouble-Grace structure).",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers in highly polarized, educated, or 'mainline' congregations who are weary of political division but deeply rooted in their 'cradle' identities.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'open' ending that leaves the tension of the 'other' as a lingering question.",
      "Incorporate more 'showing' of the baptized life in action to balance the 'telling' of political categories.",
      "Use the 'cosmic' imagery of the beginning as a recurring motif throughout the sermon."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically strong sermon that serves as a model for 'reframing' contemporary conflict. It avoids the pitfalls of moralism and kitsch by focusing on the performative 'event' of the Spirit. While it could benefit from more sensory language and a slightly more 'open' structure, its rhetorical precision and dramaturgical arc make it a compelling piece of homiletic art."
