  "aristotelian_modes_analysis": {
    "logos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The rational architecture is built on a clear two-part movement: first, an exposition of five metaphors from Isaiah, and second, a synthesis using the Matthean parable to demand a response. The logic is deductive; it starts with a premise (the nature of God determines the shape of life) and systematically explores the biblical text to prove that God is 'on the loose.' The transition between the Old Testament imagery and the New Testament application is intellectually satisfying, as the preacher links the 'banquet' metaphor across both testaments to create a unified argument. However, the connection between the demolition of cities and the personal 'newness' of the hearer requires a leap of logic that isn't fully bridged for a modern listener.",
      "quotes": [
        "It follows that the kind of God at work in your life will determine the shape and quality and risk and center of your existence.",
        "I will name these five images from the poem. You see if any of them resonate for you...",
        "Jesus took one of the images from the repertoire of Isaiah 25. The kingdom of God is like a great wedding feast."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear, numbered structure in the first section helps the listener track the argument.",
        "Strong thematic continuity between the Isaiah text and the Gospel reading.",
        "Effective use of 'if-then' logic to connect theology to anthropology."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition from the 'demolition squad' (political/social) to the 'nursemaid' (personal/emotional) lacks a unifying logical bridge.",
        "The explanation of the 'wedding garment' in Matthew is somewhat brief and relies on a quick metaphorical pivot.",
        "More explicit logical connections between the 'apocalyptic' nature of the text and daily 'safe' life would strengthen the core argument."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The sermon possesses a robust, traceable structure that successfully categorizes complex biblical imagery into a coherent theological framework."
    },
    "pathos": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Pathos is the strongest element of this sermon. The preacher uses vivid, sensory language ('rich food filled with marrow,' 'chews death to bits') to evoke visceral reactions. By contrasting the 'bland and domesticated' God of the affluent with the 'dangerous' God of the desperate, the preacher touches on the existential boredom and hidden anxieties of the congregation. The use of contemporary illustrations—like the woman inviting street people to her cancelled wedding—creates a powerful emotional resonance that makes the ancient text feel immediate. The sermon moves effectively between the 'terror' of the sea monster and the 'tenderness' of the nursemaid, covering a wide affective spectrum.",
      "quotes": [
        "God is like a sea monster that rises up out of the water with great strength and swallows death like a sea monster from Jaws.",
        "This is the hymn of somebody tired out by disadvantage, exhausted by trying to make it with no resources...",
        "God gently listens and cares and touches and holds with enormous patience, until the wave of hurt and sadness is overcome."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Masterful use of sensory metaphors (smell, taste, sight) to make the Gospel 'felt'.",
        "Direct address to the 'settled and safe' challenges the listener's emotional comfort zone.",
        "High degree of empathy for the 'little ones' and the 'wounded'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'demolition squad' metaphor might evoke political resistance in some hearers that distracts from the spiritual point.",
        "The emotional shift from the 'sea monster' to the 'nursemaid' is very abrupt.",
        "The conclusion could benefit from a more sustained emotional 'landing' rather than a quick quote from a Psalm."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The sermon excels in 'heart-pathos,' transforming abstract theological concepts into palpable, recognizable human experiences.",
      "emotional_tone": "A dynamic shift between provocative challenge (awe/fear) and profound comfort (tenderness/relief)."
    },
    "ethos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher's ethos is that of a 'prophetic teacher.' There is a clear authority derived from the text, but the preacher remains somewhat distant. While the preacher identifies the congregation as 'settled and safe' (including themselves by implication), there is little personal vulnerability. The ethos is built on intellectual and spiritual depth rather than personal testimony. The preacher speaks as a witness to the power of the biblical text, but the 'I' remains largely an analytical 'I' rather than a struggling 'I'. The authority is high, but the 'witness' role is more academic than experiential.",
      "quotes": [
        "Most of us who are settled and safe and reasonably affluent prefer a God who is somewhat bland and domesticated.",
        "I take it to mean, when you get invited to a new metaphor, you have to respond and define your life in terms of it.",
        "You see, the Bible has to use a host of images, because no single one is adequate."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong intellectual integrity; the preacher does not shy away from 'difficult' or 'odd' biblical images.",
        "Avoids moralizing 'from above' by using 'we' when discussing the desire for a domesticated God.",
        "Speaks with the authority of someone who has deeply wrestled with the Hebrew poetry."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Lack of personal vulnerability; the preacher describes the 'nursemaid' but doesn't share a moment of being comforted.",
        "The tone can occasionally feel like a lecture on 'metaphor' rather than a personal proclamation.",
        "The 'Buster' comment in the Matthew section, while intended to be colloquial, feels slightly out of character with the preceding poetic tone."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The ethos is grounded in scholarly and spiritual authority, yet it lacks the personal vulnerability that would move it from 'teacher' to 'fellow-traveler'.",
      "authenticity": "High intellectual authenticity, but moderate personal vulnerability."

    "dominant_mode": "Pathos",
    "suppressed_mode": "Ethos",
    "balance_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a powerful example of the 'New Homiletic,' where Pathos and Logos work together to create an experience of the text. The Logos provides a firm trellis for the lush Pathos of the metaphors. However, the Ethos is somewhat suppressed; the preacher's persona is that of a brilliant guide through a gallery of images, rather than a participant in the drama. The balance is effective for a teaching-oriented congregation but might feel slightly detached for those seeking a more personal, testimonial connection.",
    "consequences_of_imbalance": [
      "The hearer is intellectually and emotionally stimulated but may not feel a personal connection to the speaker.",
      "The 'dangerous' God remains a literary figure rather than a personal encounter if the preacher doesn't model the 'risk'.",
      "The heavy reliance on metaphor (Logos/Pathos) may overwhelm more literal-minded hearers."
    ],
    "recommendation_for_balance": "Increase Ethos by incorporating a brief personal reflection on which of the five images the preacher struggled with or relied upon during the past week."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_rhetorical_score": 7,
    "summary": "This is a rhetorically sophisticated sermon that avoids the common pitfall of domesticating the biblical text. Its primary strength lies in its imaginative Pathos, using vivid metaphors to break through the 'blandness' of modern religiosity. The Logos is clear and serves the imagery well, providing a structured journey through Isaiah 25. The sermon successfully challenges the hearer's worldview by presenting a God who is both a 'demolition squad' and a 'nursemaid.' The main rhetorical weakness is a somewhat distant Ethos; the preacher acts as a highly skilled curator of biblical images rather than a vulnerable witness. The transition into the 'insistence' of the wedding garment is intellectually sharp but could be more pastorally developed to help the hearer bridge the gap between 'receiving newness' and 'changing clothes.' Overall, it is a sober, effective, and intellectually stimulating piece of homiletic work.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Vivid, non-cliché metaphorical language that revitalizes ancient texts.",
      "Clear structural alignment between Old Testament prophecy and New Testament parable.",
      "Effective challenge to the 'domesticated' spirituality of affluent congregations."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase personal vulnerability to strengthen the Ethos of the messenger.",
      "Provide more concrete 'orthopraxy'—what does 'wearing the wedding robe' look like in a Monday morning context?",
      "Smooth the transitions between the vastly different emotional registers of the five images."
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Poetic-Expository",
    "audience_analysis": "Most effective for educated, 'settled' congregations who are comfortable with metaphor but need their spiritual complacency disturbed.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a 'first-person' narrative element to boost Ethos.",
      "Spend more time on the 'insistence' (application) phase of the sermon.",
      "Use one sustained metaphor throughout rather than five distinct ones to deepen the Logos."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a strong example of rhetorical excellence in the 'Poetic-Expository' tradition. It achieves a high score in Pathos through its evocative imagery and a solid score in Logos through its clear thematic structure. While the Ethos is professional and authoritative, a greater degree of personal transparency would elevate the sermon from a 'brilliant lecture' to a 'transformative encounter.' It successfully avoids grade inflation by being 'very good' (7/10) without reaching the 'model' status (9/10) that would require a more seamless integration of the preacher's own life into the message."
