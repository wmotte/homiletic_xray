    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The factual content is heavily intertwined with socio-political data rather than classical exegetical findings. The preacher uses the biblical narrative of the trial of Jesus as a structural skeleton to hang contemporary 'facts' regarding global injustice, such as the debt crisis, tourism-related exploitation in the Philippines, and the nuclear arms race (Mutlangen). Theologically, the 'Sache' is the suffering Christ identified with the suffering of the world. However, the exegesis remains largely allegorical or associative. The blue side serves to establish a global 'status confessionis' where the factual reality of the 1980s (Cold War, North-South conflict) is presented as the primary locus of God's current revelation. While clear, it risks reducing the biblical text to a mirror for political analysis.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a deeply committed, politically active faith. There is no attempt at 'neutral' distance; the 'I' is explicitly involved in the guilt of the system ('Ich unterstützte das wirtschaftliche System'). The self-revelation is characterized by a radical honesty that avoids the 'pious mask.' However, there is a certain 'Hysterical' tendency in the Riemann sense—not in the sense of superficiality, but in the dramatic, expressive identification with the 'stage' of global suffering. The preacher takes on the role of the prophetic conscience. The authenticity is high because the preacher does not exempt themselves from the judgment they proclaim.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ich habe dich geschlagen, Jesus.",

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Hysterical/Depressive hybrid. Hysterical in its dramatic, expressive reach for global significance; Depressive in its deep longing for solidarity and harmony with the victims.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship to the congregation is confrontational and provocative. The preacher uses 'We' frequently, but it is a 'We' of indictment. The relationship is defined by a shared crisis. There is a paternalistic 'teaching' tone ('In der Ersten Welt sind wir Sieger...'). The preacher positions themselves as the one who unmasks the congregation's comfortable reality. This creates 'relationship noise': a listener might feel cornered or manipulated by the rapid-fire list of global sins. The 'eye level' is maintained through shared guilt, but the rhetorical force is 'from above'—the prophet calling the people to account.",

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily dominated by the Appeal (Anspruch). The directional force is a demand for political and existential metanoia. While theologically framed as 'following the way of the cross,' it often lands as a moral imperative: stop the arms race, help the poor, leave the 'winner' mentality. The Barthian 'Gift' (Zuspruch) is secondary; God is found in the suffering, but primarily as a call to join that suffering. The risk of moralism is very high. The listener is left with a heavy burden of global guilt and a narrow path of 'true' action (e.g., going to prison or protesting). The Gospel as 'rest' or 'freedom from the self' is nearly absent, replaced by 'freedom for the victim'.",

    "summary": "This sermon is a powerful example of 'Political Homiletics' from the late 20th century. It successfully bridges the gap between the ancient Passion narrative and contemporary global crises. However, from a Schulz von Thun perspective, it is dangerously unbalanced. The 'Red' side (Appeal) and the 'Green' side (Self-revelation of the preacher's political angst) overwhelm the 'Blue' side (the objective Gospel promise). Theologically, it risks 'psychologizing' the cross into a mere symbol for human suffering and political struggle, rather than the unique, objective act of God (Barth). The relationship to the hearer is one of intense pressure, which may lead to 'Appeal-ear' fatigue or defensive withdrawal. While rhetorically brilliant and 'congruent' in its prophetic fervor, it lacks the 'diaconal' restraint that allows the listener to find grace before they are called to duty.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon risks turning God into a predicate of human political action. God is 'in the suffering,' but is He still the Sovereign Subject who acts for us?",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Uncompromising contemporary relevance.",
      "Powerful, poetic language and imagery.",
      "Radical identification with the marginalized."

    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Rebalance Law and Gospel (more Zuspruch).",
      "Reduce the 'Hysterical' dramatic intensity to prevent listener burnout.",
      "Clarify the 'Sola Gratia'—God's work independent of our political success."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A rhetorically strong, prophetic sermon that serves as a necessary 'disruption,' but fails to provide the theological 'rest' required for sustainable Christian discipleship."
