    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes concrete, sensory metaphors to ground abstract theological concepts of sin and grace. The preacher employs medical and domestic imagery—doctors, wounds, venomous snakes, and household goods—to make the internal state of the soul visible. Following Paul Scott Wilson's 'show, don't tell', the sermon visualizes the act of confession as a courtroom drama (the tribunal of conscience). While the imagery is not 'modern', it is 'living' because it connects the spiritual crisis to the physical survival instincts of the hearer. The metaphor of the 'doctor' for God is a classic but effectively handled trope here to contrast the human ability to wound with the divine ability to heal.",
      "quotes": [
        "Though the poor wretch was able to wound himself, he can’t heal himself.",
        "First of all, we must take care not to sin, not to form a dangerous friendship with the serpent.",
        "Mount the tribunal of your conscience, and stand there before yourself—not behind."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of the 'Christus Medicus' (Christ the Physician) motif.",
        "Strong spatial imagery regarding the 'tribunal of conscience'.",

      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Some metaphors (like the serpent) are highly traditional and border on 'dead metaphors' for a modern ear.",
        "The imagery of the 'gladiator' could be expanded to heighten the dramatic stakes.",
        "More sensory detail regarding the 'stench' or 'weight' of sin could enhance the 'showing'."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "The sermon leans toward 'showing' through the use of parables and analogies (the robber, the house), though it 'tells' through frequent scriptural proof-texting."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably precise, avoiding vague abstractions in favor of sharp distinctions. The preacher practices 'stewardship of language' by defining the psychological states of the sinner: the difference between despair and presumption is mapped out with surgical accuracy. There is a clear 'Canaanite' vocabulary (sin, grace, damnation), but it is used with such rhetorical vigor that it feels fresh rather than jargon-heavy. The dialectic between 'looking away from sin' but 'not looking away from the sinner' shows a high degree of linguistic nuance that does justice to the complexity of the divine-human relationship.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let it find in you a judge, not a defense attorney.",
        "If you punish it, the sin will be punished, not you; but if God does, you’ll be punished along with it.",
        "Lest we be enticed by the demon’s blandishments or cowed by his violence."

        "The repetition of 'Woe' and 'Damn' can feel repetitive if not handled with vocal variety.",
        "The use of Sirach and Wisdom might require more contextual explanation for modern audiences.",
        "The transition between the 'tribunal' and the 'robber' analogy is slightly abrupt."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Religious jargon is present but functional; terms like 'penitent' and 'providence' are contextualized through the narrative flow."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is a masterpiece of oral rhythm, likely reflecting the Latin *cursus* in its original form. It uses parallelism, antithesis, and staccato questioning to create a driving cadence. The 'dialogue' with the hypothetical objector creates a rhythmic 'give and take' that prevents the text from becoming a static lecture. The use of repetition ('Why not today? Why not now?') builds a liturgical momentum that leads the hearer toward the conclusion. It is clearly 'ear language', designed for performance and immediate impact, utilizing the rhetorical power of the 'middle style'.",
      "quotes": [
        "What kind of clothes do you want? 'Good quality, good styling.' What sort of wife? 'A good one!'",
        "You’ll perish if you despair, and perish if you hope.",
        "Why not today? Why not now while I’m talking and you’re listening?"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent use of the diatribe (imaginary dialogue) to maintain pace.",
        "Strong rhythmic parallelism that aids memorability.",
        "Effective variation in sentence length—short questions followed by longer explanations."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The rapid-fire questioning at the end might feel overwhelming if the preacher's delivery is too fast.",
        "The heavy use of 'Woe' passages creates a sonic harshness that needs balancing.",
        "The transition from the 'judge' section to the 'robber' section lacks a rhythmic bridge."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Pure oral language; the text breathes with the rhythm of live speech."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The micro-aesthetics of the sermon are characterized by a 'sober beauty' and rhetorical vigor. The preacher avoids flowery adjectives in favor of sharp, antithetical structures and concrete analogies. The imagery is functional rather than decorative, serving to 'reframe' the hearer's perception of their own conscience. The rhythm is driving and dialogical, ensuring that the 'musicality' of the sermon serves its persuasive intent. It is a high-quality example of the 'aesthetic of the word' where form and content are indistinguishable."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot'. It begins with the 'upsetting of equilibrium' (the wounded soul) and moves through a series of 'pitfalls' (despair and presumption). The tension is not merely intellectual but existential: the hearer is caught between the 'venom of the serpent' and the 'wrath of God'. The turning point occurs in the dialogue about 'tomorrow', where the preacher corners the hearer's procrastination. The movement from the 'tribunal' to the 'robber' analogy provides a dramatic crescendo, leading to a sharp, decisive conclusion that demands immediate action.",
      "quotes": [
        "Though the poor wretch was able to wound himself, he can’t heal himself.",
        "If despair couldn’t destroy it, presumption can.",
        "Now go and confess your sins, lest you be condemned."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear progression from the 'need' (healing) to the 'obstacle' (delay).",
        "The use of the 'imaginary objector' creates a palpable sense of conflict and movement.",
        "The conclusion is not a summary but a final 'thrust' of the argument."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The middle section on 'Satan' feels slightly like a theological detour from the main psychological arc.",
        "The transition between the 'tribunal' and the 'robber' could be more fluid.",
        "The ending is very abrupt, which may leave some hearers feeling 'dropped' rather than 'sent'."

      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey that systematically closes off 'escape routes' for the hearer."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is a textbook example of Cilliers' 'reframing'. It takes the ancient words of the Psalms and Ezekiel and places them directly into the domestic and psychological context of the hearer (buying clothes, choosing a wife, fearing a robber). The 'strangeness' of the biblical text (God's wrath, the serpent) is respected, but it is synthesized with the universal human experience of procrastination and self-preservation. The preacher 'reframes' the act of confession not as a burden, but as the only logical act of 'self-care' for a soul that values its own life.",
      "quotes": [
        "I’m sure you want all your belongings to be in good condition, so why would life be the one thing that you’d allow to fall apart?",
        "God promised to forgive me... And I suppose it’s your faith which guarantees you a tomorrow?",
        "Let’s suppose a robber broke in and growled, 'All this stuff or your life!'"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant synthesis of high theology and low-stakes domestic examples (clothes, houses).",
        "The biblical text is not a 'springboard' but the very 'lens' through which life is viewed.",
        "Successful 'reframing' of confession as a form of 'healing' rather than just 'punishment'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The context of the 'gladiator' is culturally distant for modern hearers and requires more 'translation'.",
        "The integration of the 'Satan' section feels less 'reframed' and more 'traditional dogma'.",
        "The transition from the 'Ezekiel' quote to the 'presumption' section is very rapid."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes; reality is reframed from 'I have time' to 'I am in immediate danger'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "By the standards of Ciska Stark's 'Open Work of Art', this sermon is relatively 'closed'. It is a 'coercive schema' designed to trap the hearer into a single conclusion: 'confess now'. While it respects the 'ambivalence of existence' (the tension between despair and hope), it does not leave the ending open for the hearer's own interpretation. The preacher acts as a 'witness' and 'judge', leaving little room for the hearer to 'resist' the logic. However, the 'openness' exists in the *invitation*—the space for grace is offered, but the door is narrow. It is a 'monovalent' work of art with a singular rhetorical goal.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now go and confess your sins, lest you be condemned.",
        "You no longer have any excuse, do you?",
        "Why not today? Why not now...?"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The sermon is honest about the 'ambivalence' of the human condition (the 'twin pitfalls').",
        "It treats the hearer as a 'mature conversation partner' through the use of logic.",
        "The 'Space for Grace' is clearly defined as an available reality."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The ending is highly prescriptive and moralistic (the 'straitjacket').",
        "There is little room for the 'mystery' of why one might struggle to confess.",
        "The sermon forces a 'binary' choice that may ignore the complexity of psychological trauma."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A closed, monovalent structure; a rhetorical 'trap' for the sake of the soul."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are dominated by a powerful, driving dramaturgy. The sermon functions as a 'performance' of a trial where the hearer is both defendant and judge. The integration of text and context is masterful, using mundane examples to illustrate cosmic truths. However, the structure is 'closed'—it is a persuasive journey with a single destination. While this is effective for its purpose, it lacks the polyvalence of an 'open work of art', opting instead for a 'dramaturgy of confrontation'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. There are no 'pre-chewed emotions' or 'happy endings' that ignore the reality of suffering. The preacher sustains the 'pain of the wound' and the 'venom of the serpent' without offering a 'cheap solution'. The comfort offered is 'costly grace', requiring the hard work of self-accusation. The emotions evoked (fear, urgency, hope) are authentic and grounded in the logic of the text, not in sentimental manipulation. It avoids the 'clichéd story' by using sharp, even harsh, analogies that disrupt the hearer's comfort.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None identified; the sermon avoids sentimental 'Jesus loves you' platitudes.",
      "The 'robber' analogy is too gritty to be kitsch."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'poor wretch' who can wound but not heal himself.",
      "The psychological insight into the 'dangerous friendship with the serpent'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'sober beauty' and resistance to easy comfort to ensure the 'Space for Grace' remains authentic."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens a 'Space for Grace' by first clearing the ground of human excuses. Following Cilliers, it moves between the 'already' of God's promise and the 'not yet' of the hearer's conversion. It sustains the tension between God's 'looking away' (mercy) and 'looking at' (judgment). While the ending is moralistic, the core of the sermon is an invitation into the 'mystery' of divine healing. The 'space' is created by the realization that the hearer cannot heal themselves—the 'vertical dimension' of the 'saving hand' is the only way out of the 'pitfalls'.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between despair and presumption are expertly sustained throughout the middle section.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of God's mercy is respected, though the mechanics of confession are explained logically.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace is the foundation, but the sermon ends with a heavy moral imperative (the 'must' of confession).",
    "recommendation": "To increase 'space', allow for a moment of 'wonder' or 'praise' at the end, rather than just a warning of condemnation."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is a robust example of 'rhetorical aesthetics' in the Reformed/Patristic tradition. Its primary strength lies in its 'sober beauty' and the precision of its language. It avoids the 'kitsch' of easy religious sentiment, opting instead for a 'dramaturgy of the conscience' that is both intellectually stimulating and existentially demanding. The preacher functions as a 'witness' to the human condition, using imagery not as decoration but as a diagnostic tool. While the structure is 'closed' and the tone is confrontational, the aesthetic quality is high because the form (the dialogical trap) perfectly matches the content (the urgency of repentance). It is an 'event' in time that forces a decision, making 'the holy happen' through the medium of logical and metaphorical persuasion.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful use of 'reframing' through domestic analogies (clothes, wife, house).",
      "Exceptional rhythmic and oral quality (musicality of the diatribe).",
      "Absolute absence of religious kitsch; authentic psychological depth."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The 'closed' and 'coercive' nature of the conclusion leaves little room for the hearer's own process.",
      "The 'Satan' section feels less integrated into the modern 'reframing' than other parts.",
      "The transition between the 'tribunal' and 'robber' metaphors could be smoother."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Rhetorical-Dialogical (Diatribe)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Performance' of Gerrit Immink.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who value logic, psychological insight, and direct challenge; less appealing to those seeking 'soft' comfort or meditative space.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'open' ending that leaves the hearer in the 'mystery' of grace.",
      "Use more 'sensory' language in the descriptions of the 'pure heart' to balance the 'tribunal' imagery.",
      "Ensure the 'Satan' metaphors are reframed for a contemporary understanding of 'evil' or 'temptation'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically strong sermon that excels in the 'Poetics of Language' and 'Integration'. It is a model of how to use rhetoric to 'reframe' reality. While it lacks the 'polyvalence' of modern aesthetic theory, its 'sober beauty' and rhythmic power make it a compelling 'event' of the Word. It scores high on authenticity and 'anti-kitsch', providing a 'Space for Grace' that is both narrow and profound."
