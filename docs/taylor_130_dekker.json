  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon focuses on Revelation 3:20. However, it fails Dekker's test of finding what is in this passage that can be found 'NOWHERE else'. Instead of specific exegesis of the Laodicean context, the preacher treats the text as a general evangelistic or devotional trope.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is, of course, a word poignantly and pointedly addressed to those who have not accepted Christ",
        "This is the fulfillment of the whole Bible knocking at your door."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the unique character of the Laodicean church (lukewarmness, self-sufficiency) and why the 'knocking' is a specific remedy for *that* condition, rather than a general gospel call."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is almost no historical-critical or linguistic exposition of the Laodicean context. The preacher mentions the 'back pasture of Horeb' and Luther more than the actual historical situation of the first readers in Asia Minor.",
      "quotes": [
        "Moses asked, 'Who is signing this decree?'",
        "Deus absconditus! said Luther."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Apply the requirement of knowing 'the exegesis and theology of the biblical books'. Explain the significance of the communal meal ('sup with him') in the Greco-Roman world."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is largely emotional and general. While there is a specific detour into 'Father's Day' and 'male models', it feels detached from the specific text of Revelation 3:20. The final promises are overly broad and verge on prosperity rhetoric.",
      "quotes": [
        "I'll tell you another thing, black people... we need male figures now.",
        "I will make friends for you and put food on your table and clothing on your back."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move away from general 'life help' and connect the application to the specific judgment and grace offered to the Laodicean 'lukewarm' condition."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is a stream of consciousness where exposition (of various texts, not just the pericope) and application are mixed, but not in the way Dekker intends. It lacks the 'recreating' of the Bible into a 'new, current, proclamatory word'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Lord stands at your heart's door and mine asking for entrance, and if we have let him in the parlor, he wants to come into the dining room"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Use the text to 'expound' the hearer. Instead of metaphors about parlors, use the text's own imagery to confront the hearer's current reality."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon addresses misery (loneliness, confusion, weakness) and redemption (Christ coming in). However, it leans toward a psychological 'misery' rather than the theological 'misery before God' that Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "Give me your confusion, and I will give you my peace.",
        "The lonely Lord, knocking."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the sense of 'misery' to include the specific spiritual blindness mentioned in the Laodicean letter (wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked)."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are present in the invitation to open the door, but the consequence of remaining 'lost' is softened. There is no mention of the 'destruction' Dekker insists upon; the tone is purely invitational.",
      "quotes": [
        "All of this knocking is of no purpose, no avail at all unless you do open the door."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the seriousness of the 'outside'. What does it mean for the church or the individual to remain with a closed door? Take the hearer seriously as a 'willing and responsible being'."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The preacher emphasizes the divinity and sufficiency of Christ ('The great I Am is knocking'). This is the strongest point according to Dekker's criteria.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is the One altogether lovely... the Mighty God... knocking at my heart's door.",
        "Man has no life in himself, it is Christ who is his life."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the Christology is rooted in the specific 'Amen, the faithful and true witness' of the Laodicean text rather than a list of general titles."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 14-15 minutes (1450 words), the sermon fails Dekker's 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for theological 'depth'.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section to provide the necessary 'breadth' for the sermon to reach the 20-minute mark."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily due to a lack of rigorous exegesis and a failure to meet the required length for depth. It treats the Bible passage as a springboard for general spiritual encouragement rather than a specific, current word from God. The application is often general or socio-psychological (Father's Day) rather than being derived from the text's unique content.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christocentric focus, identifying Christ as the 'I Am' and the ultimate goal of the message.",
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' (misery/redemption) in a way that addresses the human subject."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient duration (under 20 minutes) prevents the necessary 'breadth' for theological depth.",
      "Lack of original context; the specific situation of Laodicea is ignored in favor of general tropes.",
      "General truths: The sermon relies on 'general truths' about Jesus being a friend, which Dekker explicitly forbids."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate devotional speech, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict sense of Dekker's theses. It lacks the formal requirement of specific exposition and the substantive requirement of depth through breadth."
