A case could be made that this is the most important Sunday of the year to come to church. [...] The weight of our sin, yours and mine, was assumed by him. Let us come in the full knowledge of our own culpability — for as we do, in that same moment, we shall recognize in this staggering event of his dereliction the overwhelming joy of our deliverance.",

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with the 'strange' feeling of Palm Sunday and uses the anecdote of a woman refusing to say 'Crucify him' to ground the message in human psychology. However, it lacks a sustained, vivid narrative that allows the hearer to 'feel' the Gethsemane scene; it describes the disciples' sleep as 'like a depressed person,' which is a helpful but brief psychological bridge. The experience is more cognitive-emotional than sensory-immersive.",
      "quotes": [
        "We come in joyful, and we go out stricken.",
        "I once knew a woman who wouldn’t come to church on Palm Sunday because she couldn’t stand being asked to shout 'Crucify him!'",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher excels at pausing to ask 'why' and exploring the problem of Jesus' distress compared to figures like Socrates. He analyzes the human condition through the lens of fear—specifically the fear of abandonment—and links it to social behaviors (politicians, corporate executives). This provides a solid cultural and psychological critique before moving to theological answers.",

      "analysis": "This is the strongest phase of the sermon. The preacher provides a clear, logical theological framework for the 'Cry of Dereliction.' He uses exegesis (Habakkuk, St. Paul) to construct a 'Big Idea': that Jesus' suffering was not the fear of death, but the experience of Godforsakenness due to identification with sin. The logic is tight and the dogmatic deepening is substantial.",

      "analysis": "The sermon ends with a call to 'give ourselves to him' and to 'not withdraw,' but these remain largely internal or liturgical actions. While it quotes a parishioner on daily sins (busy-ness, sharp tongue), it lacks a specific 'Monday morning' application. The 'experimentation' is primarily an invitation to a different internal attitude during Holy Week rather than concrete outward action.",

    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of the Declarative/Assimilating style, focusing on the theological resolution of a biblical 'problem' (the Cry of Dereliction). It successfully moves through the Kolb cycle, starting with the concrete experience of the Palm Sunday liturgy and the psychological resistance to the Passion. It transitions into a deep reflective observation on the nature of fear and the 'scandal' of Jesus' agony. The core of the sermon is a robust abstract conceptualization of substitutionary atonement, which is handled with intellectual rigor and clarity. Where the sermon falls short is in the final phase of the cycle: Active Experimentation. The applications are largely internal (repentance, understanding) or liturgical (attending Holy Week services). While the sermon provides a profound 'Big Idea,' it offers fewer concrete handles for how the 'deliverance from fear' manifests in the ethical life of the believer outside the church walls. It is a 'priestly/prophetic' sermon that prioritizes normative truth over pragmatic response.",

    "conclusion": "The sermon is a high-quality example of traditional Anglican/Mainline preaching that values theological depth and liturgical context. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'Head-to-Heart' sermon that successfully explains the 'Why' and 'What' of the Gospel. Its primary diagnostic need is a more robust 'How'—translating the staggering theological reality of Christ's dereliction into the concrete, active experimentation of the Christian life. It is well-suited for an educated, 'Assimilating' congregation but could increase its impact by more intentionally serving the 'Accommodating' and 'Converging' learners through specific, ethical application."
