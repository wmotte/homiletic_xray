    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games'. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, processing the 'here-and-now' data of church decline and global scandal without resorting to the Critical Parent's shaming or the Rescuer's false promises. By using the Nurturing Parent's maternal imagery of God, the preacher provides a secure base for the congregation to move from a 'Victim' stance (feeling forgotten) to an autonomous 'Builder' stance. The inclusion of the 'missing' verse serves as an Adult-to-Adult respect for the listeners' intelligence.",

    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the Zimbabwe scandal to the local context is slightly abrupt.",
      "Could further empower the 'Free Child' by exploring the creativity of 'building' more specifically."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to ground theological promises in Adult reality-testing. Ensure that the 'Rescuer' role is always attributed to the Divine and not the clerical office."
