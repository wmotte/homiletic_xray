    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery not merely for decoration but as a vehicle for 'reframing' (Cilliers). The preacher contrasts the 'top-down silence' of the temple with the 'shrill' and 'bursting' words of the street poet. There is a strong sensory contrast between the 'big bowls of wine' and the 'pair of shoes' representing exploitation. While the imagery is grounded in the biblical text, it is effectively translated into contemporary metaphors like the 'narcotic of consumer goods.' The imagery serves to unmask the 'illusionary world' of the hearer. However, some metaphors remain slightly abstract (e.g., 'zone of market ideology'), preventing a perfect score. The 'show, don't tell' principle is applied well in the description of Amos as a 'street poet' who 'hunches,' providing a physical presence to the prophetic task.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably precise and avoids 'Canaanite' jargon. Brueggemann (the likely author) practices 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre) by redefining common terms like 'silence' and 'neighbor.' He avoids the cliché of the 'Good Samaritan' as a simple helper, instead precisely identifying him as a 'threat to the status quo.' The word choice is economical; every sentence carries weight. The distinction between 'Jesus talk' and 'neighbor talk' is a precise rhetorical device that prevents the message from dissolving into vague sentimentality. The language is sharp, hitting the core of the political and religious intersection without becoming a mere political stump speech.",
      "quotes": [
        "The silencing is by accommodating the name of Jesus to all manner of consumerism.",
        "Amos is a poet. He just hunches, which is what poets do.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a rhythmic cadence, particularly through the use of anaphora ('Let the... keep silent') and parallelism. The sentence structure varies effectively between short, punchy declarations ('Shut up and go away') and longer, flowing reflections. There is a palpable 'staccato' in the Amos section that mirrors the urgency of the prophet. The repetition of 'Jesus talk' and 'neighbor talk' creates a liturgical rhythm that aids memorability. It is clearly written for the ear, utilizing rhetorical figures that build momentum toward the conclusion. The 'musicality' here is not melodic but percussive, fitting the prophetic theme.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let the prophets keep silent. Let Blacks keep silent. Let the poor keep silent.",

    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' and prophetic urgency. It avoids the 'kitsch' of easy comfort, opting instead for sharp, precise metaphors that reframe the hearer's reality. The imagery is grounded in the biblical text but vibrates with contemporary relevance. The rhythm is percussive and demanding, reflecting the 'shrill' voice of Amos. It is a prime example of stewardship of language, where words are used as tools for truth-telling rather than instruments of obfuscation."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' by reinterpreting a beloved liturgical verse (Hab. 2:20) as a tool of oppression. This creates immediate tension. The movement from the 'silencing' in Amos to the 'silencing' in modern consumerism provides a clear narrative arc. The turning point is the realization that 'God is a voice that will speak through such imposed silence.' However, the inclusion of three separate biblical texts (Amos, Colossians, Luke) creates a somewhat fragmented structure, making it feel like three mini-sermons tied together by a theme rather than a single, seamless journey.",
      "quotes": [
        "I always figured that these lines were written by a librarian of the old school... But I know it was written by a priest... who was a great silencer.",
        "And then in one of the most dramatic moments in scripture, the poet is confronted by the high priest.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. It exemplifies Cilliers' 'reframing.' The ancient conflict between Amos and Amaziah is seamlessly mapped onto modern conflicts regarding white nationalism, consumerism, and immigration. The 'strangeness' of the biblical text is preserved—Amos remains a 'street poet'—yet it becomes a mirror for the present. The integration is not forced; it flows from a deep theological conviction that the Word is an active 'event' (Immink). The sermon does not just apply the text; it allows the text to 'frame' the modern world in a way that makes the familiar (consumerism) look strange and the strange (the Samaritan) look like the only hope.",
      "quotes": [
        "The high priest, an agent of the king... reported to the king that Amos was a traitor.",
        "Our silencing is accomplished by the narcotic of consumer goods.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is rhetorically powerful, it leans toward a 'closed' structure in its moral urgency. The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long), but the 'verdicts' are quite definitive. There is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' for those who might feel caught in the systems described; they are largely addressed as those needing to be 'shaken up.' However, it remains an 'open work of art' (Stark) in the sense that it invites the hearer into a 'conversation that will not be silent.' The ending is an invitation to a 'walk,' which leaves the specific enactment of that walk to the hearer's context.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus interrupts all such talk with a simple verdict.",
        "We will insist on such talk and then we will insist upon such walk.",
        "But we know a more excellent way; and we have to speak about it!"

        "Invites the hearer into a new community of 'neighbor talk'.",
        "Acknowledges the difficulty of the task ('God called us and we had to speak').",
        "Avoids a 'happy ending' in favor of a 'more excellent way' that involves struggle."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'verdicts' can feel slightly coercive to a hearer who feels defensive.",
        "More room could be made for the 'lament' of those silenced.",
        "The conclusion is a bit prescriptive ('We will insist')."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Largely monovalent in its prophetic call, but open in its invitation to communal participation."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon's structure is a dramaturgical journey from the 'silence' of the temple to the 'vocal' life of the neighborhood. It successfully integrates multiple difficult texts into a coherent narrative of resistance. While the 'three-point' structure of the second half risks becoming static, the sheer rhetorical energy and the power of the 'reframing' keep the hearer engaged. It is a performance of 'truth-telling' that moves the hearer from the role of a passive subject of the 'king' to an active 'neighbor' in the kingdom of God."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a powerful antidote to religious kitsch. It explicitly attacks the 'narcotic' of consumerism and the 'domestication' of Jesus—the very sources of homiletical kitsch. There are no 'pre-chewed emotions' here; the comfort offered is 'fierce' and 'dangerous.' Brueggemann avoids the 'happy ending' cliché, acknowledging that truth-telling 'sounds like treason' and leads to 'big trouble.' The 'Good Samaritan' is stripped of its Sunday-school sentimentality and restored to its original, jarring 'strangeness.' It is an authentic aesthetic encounter with the 'Holy' that does not resolve tensions cheaply.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'innocuous line about helping out' (which the sermon rejects).",
      "The 'illusionary world of well-being' (which the sermon unmasks)."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of Amos as a poet who 'hunches' because he sees the 'sorry end' coming.",
      "The admission that 'we were minding our own business' before God compelled us to speak."

    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of critical deconstruction of 'sentimental' religion to ensure the 'Space for Grace' remains authentic."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by first clearing the 'clutter' of royal ideology and consumerism. Cilliers' 'Space for Grace' requires an encounter with the 'unavailable' God; by portraying God as the one who 'interrupts' and 'compels' speech, the sermon creates a space where God is an actor, not just a topic. The tension between 'Jesus talk' and 'neighbor talk' is sustained, preventing the gospel from becoming either a private pietism or a mere social program. Grace is presented not as a 'cheap solution' but as a 'dangerous compelling articulation' that shakes up entitlement.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'already' of Jesus' Lordship and the 'not yet' of social justice is held firmly.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of God's 'calling' (Amos was just a shepherd) is respected over professional credentials.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "While the sermon is ethically demanding, the 'demand' is rooted in the 'gift' of Jesus as the 'first-born of creation.'",
    "recommendation": "To open even more space, the preacher could dwell longer on the 'silence' of God in the face of injustice before moving to the 'voice' of God."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.6,
    "summary": "This sermon is a robust example of the 'aesthetic turn' in its prophetic mode. It rejects the 'vertical revelation' that silences the human condition, opting instead for a 'reframing' of reality through the gritty imagery of a street poet. The aesthetic quality lies in its 'sober beauty' and its refusal of 'kitsch.' The language is precise, rhythmic, and performative, turning the act of preaching into an 'event' where the 'holy happens' through the disruption of the status quo. While the structure is slightly burdened by the weight of three distinct biblical texts, the thematic coherence of 'silence vs. speech' provides a strong narrative arc. It is an 'open work' in its invitation to a new way of walking, even if its prophetic verdicts are delivered with a certain 'shrill' authority. The sermon succeeds aesthetically because the *form* (disruptive, rhythmic, contrasting) perfectly matches the *content* (the disruptive Word of God).",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of biblical texts into contemporary political and social contexts.",

    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a single-text focus to deepen the 'cinematic' quality of the imagery.",
      "Read the text aloud to further refine the 'percussive' rhythm of the prose.",
      "Explore the 'aesthetic of silence' not just as a tool of the king, but as a space for 'waiting on God'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically strong, intellectually rigorous, and prophetically urgent sermon. It avoids the pitfalls of 'aestheticism' (beauty for beauty's sake) by ensuring that every image and rhythmic turn serves the radicality of the gospel. It is a model of how to use language to 'unmask' the world and 'open space' for a grace that is both comforting and dangerous."
