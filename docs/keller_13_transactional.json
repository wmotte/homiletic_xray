    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' It operates primarily from an Adult ego position, using reason and aesthetic appreciation to invite the listener into a state of 'repose.' By acknowledging the 'terror of creation' and personal fallibility, the preacher avoids the trap of the 'Perfect Parent' and instead fosters a sense of shared human experience. The transition from the 'useful' (Child-like need) to the 'beautiful' (Adult/Free Child appreciation) is a healthy psychological movement toward maturity and autonomy.",
    "strengths": [
      "High intellectual honesty and Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "Effective use of the Free Child's capacity for joy and beauty (Mozart analogy).",
      "Avoidance of the Drama Triangle; the preacher does not position himself as the hero."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Parent' voice could occasionally be more explicit in affirming the listener's current progress to balance the high 'Adult' demands of the text.",
      "The transition to the 'Christological' ending is a bit abrupt, which can sometimes trigger a 'Parental' dogmatic shift."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements and admit intellectual limitations. This levels the playing field and prevents the congregation from regressing into a dependent 'Adapted Child' state."
