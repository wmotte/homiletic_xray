    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery effectively in certain historical passages, particularly when describing the Babylonian exile. The 'weeping willows of Babylon' and 'eyes put out' provide visceral, sensory anchors. However, as the sermon progresses toward the 'about-to-be', the imagery becomes increasingly abstract and conventional. The use of 'jasper walls' and 'gates of pearl' relies on biblical stock imagery rather than fresh, creative metaphors. While it 'shows' the historical scene well, it 'tells' the future glory through familiar religious tropes. The 'snapshot photographs' metaphor for individual lives is a strong, modern touch that briefly bridges the gap between the ancient text and the hearer's reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "The proud aristocrats... were carried into slavery by the low canals and among the weeping willows of Babylon.",
        "Zedekiah, their king, had his eyes put out after he was forced to watch the execution of his sons.",
        "One day... these walls will seem in the glory of worship like jasper walls, shining like jewels."

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strong 'showing' in the historical section; shifts to 'telling' and abstract proclamation in the second half."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The language is rhetorically polished but occasionally falls into 'Canaanite' jargon and repetitive lists. The preacher uses terms like 'Christian agnostic' and 'sub-Christian' with precision in the introduction, which engages the intellect. However, the latter half of the sermon dissolves into a litany of 'new' things (new name, new walk, new talk) that lacks specific nuance. The stewardship of language is compromised by the use of clichés like 'the best is yet to be' and 'fruit of Canaan land.' While the sentences are grammatically sound and possess a certain dignity, they often favor rhetorical sweep over precise description of human experience.",
      "quotes": [
        "If such is your answer, then score yourself as a Christian agnostic.",
        "Thank God through Jesus for a new name, a new walk, a new talk, a new hope, a new song...",
        "We have scarcely begun to taste the fruit of Canaan land."

        "Clear, intellectual categorization of 'non-Christian' views in the intro.",
        "Dignified, formal tone that respects the gravity of the subject.",
        "Effective use of scholarly references (Deutero-Isaiah) to ground the text."

        "Define what 'new hands' or 'new feet' look like in a 20th-century ethical context."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Significant use of traditional religious jargon in the second half, though the introduction is refreshingly analytical."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. It is clearly written for the ear, utilizing classical rhetorical devices like anaphora ('The best...', 'God's people lived on...') and parallelism. The rhythm is homiletically 'black' or 'high-church' in its cadence, building a crescendo toward the end. The repetition of the phrase 'God's people lived on, and God's purpose marched on' acts as a rhythmic refrain that provides a sense of inevitability and momentum. The sentence length varies effectively, moving from short, punchy assertions to long, flowing scriptural quotations. It possesses a 'legato' quality that makes it highly performative.",
      "quotes": [
        "God's people lived on, and God's purpose marched on.",
        "The best sermon has not yet been preached. The best song has not yet been sung.",
        "I hear Peter cry... I hear John answer..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent use of anaphora and refrain to create a 'march-like' rhythm.",
        "Strong oral quality; the text 'breathes' with natural pauses and swells.",
        "Effective rhetorical build-up (climax) in the final third."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The rhythm occasionally becomes predictable, bordering on a sing-song cadence.",
        "Ensure the 'musical' repetition doesn't mask a lack of new content in the later sections.",
        "Break the repetitive structure occasionally to surprise the listener's ear."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Distinctly oral language; this is a performance script, not an essay."
    },
    "average_score_language": 6.33,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high degree of musicality and rhetorical rhythm, making it an effective oral event. It successfully uses historical imagery to ground the biblical narrative. However, it suffers from a decline into religious jargon and clichéd metaphors in its second half. While the 'march of history' is linguistically well-captured, the transition to the 'new life' relies on repetitive lists rather than precise, contemporary language. It is a strong example of traditional oratorical poetics that prioritizes cadence over original metaphor."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Lowry-esque' plot: it begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' by questioning the hearer's outlook on life. It moves through the 'disorientation' of the exile and the 'clue' of God's activity in history, leading to a 'reorientation' in the promise of the 'about-to-be.' The movement from the 'bleak night' of Babylon to the 'new Jerusalem' provides a satisfying macro-arc. However, the tension is resolved somewhat early; once the historical pattern of 'God's purpose marching on' is established, the conclusion becomes a foregone conclusion, reducing the dramatic stakes in the final minutes.",
      "quotes": [
        "What do you think of events in your life? Are they just happenings, accidental or chance occurrences...?",
        "The morning would surely come though the night seemed so dark and so endless.",
        "The whole future is God's great about-to-be."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong, provocative opening that creates immediate existential tension.",
        "Clear movement from historical 'trouble' to eschatological 'grace'.",
        "Consistent thematic thread (the 'about-to-be') that ties the sections together."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition from the historical lesson to the present application is a bit abrupt.",
        "Sustain the 'conflict' longer; the 'solution' is presented as a repetitive list rather than a hard-won victory.",
        "Avoid the 'anticlimax' of repeating the same point (God wins) through multiple historical examples."

      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey from existential doubt through historical tragedy to eschatological hope."

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The integration of the Babylonian context with the concept of a 'Christian philosophy of life' is well-handled. The preacher 'reframes' the hearer's mundane 'happenings' as part of a larger divine drama. However, the contemporary context (racism, war, poverty) is mentioned only briefly as a list of things to be 'chained and banished.' This feels more like a 'pasted-on' application than a deep 'reframing' of the hearer's specific 20th-century reality. The 'strangeness' of the exile is respected, but the 'strangeness' of God's action today is smoothed over by optimistic rhetoric.",
      "quotes": [
        "Are the events of the world, the thunderous roar of public life, just so many incidents that take place without rhyme and without reason?",
        "In the midst of the mighty march of great world empires... God still moved.",
        "The evils of racism, war, and poverty will be chained and banished. It will happen!"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Successful 'reframing' of history as 'God's great about-to-be'.",
        "Good use of biblical scholarship to bridge the 'then' and 'now'.",
        "The 'snapshot' metaphor effectively connects the cosmic to the individual."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Deepen the analysis of contemporary 'exile' (e.g., how racism specifically challenges the 'about-to-be').",
        "Avoid the 'springboard' effect where the text is used to launch into general optimism.",
        "Address the 'resistance'—why is it hard for us to see God's glory in the 'thunderous roar'?"
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Provides a new frame (God as the owner of the future) but applies it with broad strokes."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "Aesthetically, this sermon is quite 'closed.' It functions as a declarative 'witness' (in Long's sense) but leaves little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' mentioned by Stark. The preacher answers every question raised in the introduction with a resounding, repetitive 'It will happen!' While this offers comfort, it risks being 'monovalent.' The hearer is swept up in a rhetorical tide rather than invited into a space of interpretation. The ending is a series of authoritative scriptural proclamations that leave little room for the hearer's own struggle or 'appropriation'—it is a 'sealed' system of hope.",
      "quotes": [
        "It will happen!",
        "The best God has for us is yet to be.",
        "How dare any Christian sigh and yawn as if we enlisted in some dull and unexciting cause!"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "High degree of certainty and 'consolatio' for a struggling congregation.",
        "The authoritative use of Scripture provides a solid 'rock' to stand on.",
        "The 'open' ending of the future is proclaimed with great energy."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Allow more room for the 'Christian agnostic' mentioned in the intro to remain in the conversation.",
        "End with an invitation or a question rather than a series of 'I hear...' declarations.",
        "Acknowledge the 'not yet' more honestly to balance the 'already' of the rhetoric."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A closed, monovalent work of art; a 'coercive' (though positive) rhetorical schema."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 5.67,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon possesses a strong narrative arc that moves from existential questioning to eschatological certainty. It effectively uses the Babylonian exile as a mirror for the human condition. However, the structure becomes repetitive and 'closed' in the second half. The integration of contemporary context is somewhat superficial, and the sermon lacks the 'polyvalence' of an open work of art, opting instead for a rhetorical 'tour de force' that leaves little room for the listener's own interpretive struggle."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 5,
    "analysis": "The sermon teeters on the edge of religious kitsch. The historical section is authentic and gritty, but the eschatological section ('jasper walls', 'best song not yet sung') flirts with 'pre-chewed emotions.' The phrase 'the best is yet to be' is a classic cliché that offers immediate comfort without fully sustaining the 'pain of the exile.' However, the preacher's intellectual rigor in the introduction and the historical depth of the middle section provide enough 'authentic depth' to prevent it from becoming pure kitsch. It is 'sentimental' in its hope, but grounded in a 'theology of history' that gives it some weight.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The repetitive 'The best... has not yet been...' litany.",
      "The use of 'jasper walls' and 'gates of pearl' as literalized symbols of success."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'bleeding spirits' and 'furious battle with doubt' in Babylon.",
      "The intellectual challenge to 'Christian agnosticism' in the opening."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To increase depth, the preacher should spend more time in the 'low canals of Babylon' before jumping to the 'jasper walls.' Authenticity requires that the 'new' be born out of the specific 'old' pain."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is opened through the concept of 'reframing'—allowing the hearer to see their life as part of God's 'about-to-be.' This is a classic Cilliers 'Space for Grace.' However, the space is partially closed by the 'moralization of mood' (telling the hearer they shouldn't 'sigh and yawn'). Grace is presented as an inevitable historical force ('God's purpose marched on') which is comforting, but it leaves little room for the 'mystery' of God's apparent absence. The 'already' heavily outweighs the 'not yet,' potentially overwhelming the hearer with a 'triumphalist' aesthetic.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are introduced (exile, doubt) but resolved perhaps too 'cheaply' through rhetorical repetition.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of history is explained as a clear pattern of 'God's march,' reducing the 'unavailable' quality of the Holy.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails as a historical theme, but moralization appears in the 'how dare you' exhortations.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'storm and fury' of the present to remain a mystery for a moment longer before resolving it with the 'new Jerusalem'."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6,
    "summary": "This sermon is a rhetorically powerful example of the 'Witness' style of preaching. Its greatest aesthetic achievement lies in its musicality and its ability to 'reframe' history through a theological lens. The preacher successfully creates a sense of movement from the 'bleak night' of human failure to the 'dawn song' of divine promise. However, the sermon is aesthetically hampered by its reliance on traditional religious clichés and a 'closed' structure that favors rhetorical persuasion over interpretive openness. While it avoids the worst excesses of kitsch through its historical and scholarly grounding, it occasionally settles for 'sentiment' over 'authentic emotion' in its eschatological vision. It is a 'sober-Reformed' oration with 'Narrative-Dramatic' elements that would highly appeal to a traditional congregation seeking reassurance.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rhetorical rhythm and musicality (anaphora and refrain).",
      "Vivid historical 'painting' of the Babylonian exile.",
      "Strong 'reframing' of mundane events as part of a divine 'about-to-be'."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduce reliance on clichéd eschatological imagery (jasper, pearls).",
      "Create more 'openness' for the hearer's doubt and struggle in the conclusion.",
      "Deepen the concrete application to contemporary social 'exiles' (racism, poverty)."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Dramatic with a High-Oratorical finish.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Thomas G. Long's 'Witness' model and Paul Scott Wilson's 'Four Pages' (Trouble/Grace balance).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to hearers who value tradition, oratorical 'flow', and clear, authoritative comfort.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending'—leave the hearer with a task of perception rather than a resolved litany.",
      "Use more 'found' metaphors from modern life to describe 'newness' (beyond 'new hands/feet').",
      "Read the text aloud to ensure the 'musicality' doesn't become a monotonous 'sing-song'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically 'good' (6/10) performance that excels in cadence and historical narrative but falls short of 'excellent' due to its predictable eschatological imagery and closed rhetorical structure. It creates a 'Space for Grace' by reframing history, yet partially fills that space with traditional tropes that may not fully resonate with the 'Christian agnostic' it seeks to reach. It is a solid, professional homiletical work that prioritizes the 'dawn song' of proclamation over the 'lament' of the present."
