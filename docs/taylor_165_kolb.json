    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon attempts to facilitate concrete experience primarily through the sensory description of Sodom and the visceral imagery of the atomic bomb. However, it lacks a contemporary 'slice of life' that the hearer can inhabit personally. The experience is largely historical or catastrophic rather than everyday-relatable. The identification with Lot's wife is present but remains somewhat distanced by the 'wicked city' trope.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This phase is well-developed through the exploration of human motives. The preacher pauses to analyze why people are 'earnest' and how they self-deceive. The sermon effectively uses the 'Scottish church' anecdote to reflect on the human tendency to prioritize personal will over Divine will. It moves from the 'what' to the 'why' of human stubbornness.",

        "Sometimes we are intensely earnest because our own interest is involved or we do not like to be made out to be wrong.",

The preacher relies on the authority of Jesus' words rather than a systematic theological development of the text's context in Luke.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon concludes with a call to action, but it remains largely at the level of internal disposition rather than concrete external steps. The commands ('Get out!', 'Turn!') are powerful but lack specific application for a modern hearer's Monday morning. It identifies the 'what' of change but only vaguely the 'how'.",

It falls short in providing contemporary concrete experiences, relying instead on historical and catastrophic imagery (Hiroshima) that may feel distant to a modern audience. The reflective observation regarding human vanity is a highlight, offering genuine psychological depth. However, the active experimentation phase remains largely at the level of abstract imperatives ('Turn!'), lacking the specific, practical handles required for holistic adult learning. The theological conceptualization of judgment and metanoia is clear and logically consistent, though it leans heavily on the preacher's authority and the vividness of the Lot narrative.",

    "conclusion": "The sermon 'A Terrible Warning' is a robust, sober analysis of Luke 17:32 that effectively utilizes narrative and reflection to confront the hearer with the reality of judgment. From a Kolb perspective, it succeeds in the 'Head' and 'Heart' quadrants but requires more development in the 'Hands' quadrant to be truly transformative for an adult learner. The priority for improvement is the translation of biblical imperatives into contemporary, actionable steps."
