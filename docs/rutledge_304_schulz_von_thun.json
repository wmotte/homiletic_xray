  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a robust dogmatic framework, grounding the Holy Spirit in the Trinitarian tradition ('proceeding from the Father and the Son'). There is a clear exegetical trajectory from Genesis to the Johannine 'Paraclete' and Pauline 'Charismata'. The 'Sache' (the living Christ) is central; the Spirit is defined strictly as the 'Spirit of Jesus,' preventing a vague spiritualism. However, the blue side occasionally leans into polemics regarding gendered language and 'fashions,' which risks shifting the focus from the theological 'Sache' to ecclesiastical politics. The distinction between 'disciples' and 'apostles' is handled with etymological precision, serving the clarity of the message.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Holy Spirit is not a what and not an it.",
        "Pentecost is the first salvo in God’s great plan to undo the effects of the Tower of Babel.",
        "The word apostolos, in Greek, means 'one who is sent.'"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong Trinitarian grounding.",
        "Clear distinction between human 'spirit' and the Holy Spirit."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The polemic against feminine pronouns for the Spirit feels slightly detached from the primary exegetical flow.",
        "Could deepen the Barthian 'Acting Subject' aspect earlier in the text."
      ],
      "comprehensibility_check": "High. Complex dogmatic concepts are translated into accessible analogies like 'Deep Blue' and 'duende'."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a vulnerability in the introduction, admitting to feeling 'foolish and small' in the face of digital scale. This creates an authentic entry point. However, the persona quickly shifts into a more 'Compulsive' (Riemann) mode—focused on correctness, biblical warrant, and traditional boundaries. There is a sense of a guardian of the 'Apostolic' flame. The 'I' is largely diaconal, serving the office of the preacher, but the insistence on specific linguistic markers ('he') reveals a personality that values order and historical continuity over contemporary adaptation.",
      "quotes": [
        "For a few minutes I felt very foolish and small.",
        "I am going to ask you to do something I have only done three or four times before in my twenty years of ministry.",
        "I admit it’s tricky, because the Spirit can’t be pinned down..."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive with a hint of Schizoid distance. The preacher emphasizes structure, 'course corrections,' and biblical warrant to maintain the integrity of the message against 'fashion.'",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is subservient to the text, though the preacher's authority is palpable in the 'invitation' section.",
      "strengths": [
        "Honesty about initial doubts regarding the relevance of preaching.",
        "Professional distance that keeps the focus on the Spirit."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'correction' on gender language 'leaks' a certain rigidity that might distract from the self-revelation of faith.",
        "More 'fides qua' (personal trust) could balance the 'fides quae' (correct doctrine)."

    },
    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher-Student' or 'Guardian-Flock.' The preacher uses 'we' frequently, but the 'yellow' signals are often paternalistic. The instruction to stand up is framed as an 'invitation, not an order,' yet the psychological weight of a 20-year tenure makes this a strong directive. There is 'relationship noise' when the preacher dismisses modern 'fashions'; this may alienate hearers who find meaning in those expressions, creating a 'from above' dynamic. However, the mention of the local memorial service shows a pastorally sensitive 'eye-level' connection to the specific congregation's grief.",
      "quotes": [
        "We need to make a course correction right away.",
        "You don’t have to do this; it is an invitation, not an order.",
        "I wonder if you noticed anything strange a few moments ago."

        "Reduce the 'teaching' tone in favor of a 'witnessing' tone.",
        "Soften the 'course correction' language to be less corrective of the hearer."
      ]
    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily to 'understand' and 'receive.' The preacher avoids moralism (Anspruch) by grounding the call to action in the gift (Zuspruch) of the Spirit. The 'red' side is most active at the end, where the congregation is asked to stand. This is a performative appeal: to embody the 'apostolic' identity. The risk of moralism is low because the preacher emphasizes that the power comes from the Spirit, not human effort. However, the appeal to 'test the spirits' is a cognitive demand that requires significant theological discernment from the listener.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you feel moved to do so, simply stand up in your places...",
        "To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.",
        "May you be granted such an abundance of gifts..."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Strong balance. The 'Anspruch' (stand up, use your gifts) is entirely dependent on the 'Zuspruch' (the Spirit has been given).",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Low. The sermon emphasizes that the Apostles were 'ordinary' and 'feckless' until the Spirit acted.",
      "strengths": [
        "The appeal is participatory rather than just imperative.",
        "The goal is 'Faith/Trust' rather than 'Behavioral Change'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The appeal to 'test the spirits' could be more practically grounded for the layperson.",
        "The transition to the 'standing' exercise is slightly abrupt."

  "congruence_and_disruptions": {
    "congruence_judgment": "Generally congruent, though the 'Green' side's rigidity regarding language slightly chafes against the 'Yellow' side's claim of solidarity.",
    "dominant_side": "Blue (Factual/Dogmatic)",
    "disruptions": "The 'Deep Blue' analogy is a strong opening but the transition to the 'gender of the Spirit' creates a communicative 'bump' that shifts the ear from the Gospel to dogmatic policing.",
    "healing_disruption": "The challenge to 'shut down St. John’s' if Pentecost isn't real is a high-quality 'healing disruption' that forces the congregation to confront the existential weight of their faith."
  },
  "reception_simulation": {
    "the_factual_ear_hears": "The Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity, masculine in biblical witness, and the source of apostolic authority.",
    "the_relational_ear_hears": "The preacher is a traditionalist who wants us to stay within biblical boundaries, but also cares about our local losses.",
    "the_appeal_ear_hears": "I need to stand up, look at my Bible, and realize I have a gift I should be using for the church.",
    "the_self_revelation_ear_hears": "The preacher feels the pressure of the modern world/technology and finds security in the 'Apostolic' tradition."
  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a solid, traditional sermon that successfully navigates the tension between the 'spirit of the world' (symbolized by the Internet) and the 'Spirit of God.' Theologically, it is deeply Barthian in its insistence that the Spirit is the 'Acting Subject' and not merely human 'team spirit.' Psychologically, the preacher utilizes a 'Compulsive' structure to provide the congregation with a sense of stability and historical continuity. The congruence is strong, particularly in the alignment of the 'Apostolic' theme with the physical architecture of the church (the windows). The main weakness lies in the 'Yellow' side; the preacher’s authoritative 'course corrections' may trigger the 'Relationship Ear' of a modern congregation, potentially overshadowing the 'Blue' content of grace. The performative ending (standing up) is a bold homiletical move that successfully shifts the sermon from a lecture to an event, though it carries the risk of being perceived as a 'staged' appeal.",
    "barthian_warning": "Low risk of psychologization. The preacher explicitly rejects reducing the Spirit to 'human spirit' or 'duende,' maintaining God's transcendence.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Excellent use of local 'visual' exegesis (the windows).",
      "Clear theological boundaries against vague spiritualism.",
      "Effective 'healing disruption' regarding the church's validity."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce the 'corrective' tone regarding modern language 'fashions'.",
      "Integrate the 'Deep Blue' analogy more deeply into the conclusion.",
      "Allow for more 'Selbstenthüllung' (vulnerability) beyond the introduction."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively integral sermon that prioritizes the 'Sache' of the Gospel over the 'Ego' of the preacher, achieving a high degree of theological clarity."
