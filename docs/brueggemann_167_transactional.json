        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "The CP is largely absent. Instead of demanding obedience, the preacher describes the 'religious' stage as a loss of control, which is the antithesis of CP's rigid structure.",

        "score": 6,
        "score_explanation": "10 = Healthy, non-smothering care. The preacher validates the 'ethical' stage (Stage 2) as valuable, avoiding the trap of making the listeners feel worthless for not being in Stage 3 yet.",

      "presence": "High",
      "analysis": "The preacher addresses the congregation as thinking subjects (Adult-to-Adult). He uses Kierkegaard to provide a map of psychological and spiritual development, inviting reflection rather than blind reaction.",

        "presence_of_adaptation": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher acknowledges the 'restlessness' of the ethical life, which touches on the AC's need for 'score-keeping,' but encourages moving beyond it.",

        "presence": "Medium",
        "analysis": "The FC appears in the description of 'free fall' and 'wonder,' though it is described more than it is performed.",

    "communicative_purity_score": 9,
    "purity_explanation": "The sermon is highly transparent. The preacher even includes himself in the 'second-stage folk,' avoiding a 'holier-than-thou' ulterior transaction.",
    "risk_explanation": "The only risk is the 'Bait & Switch' inherent in the text (Jesus's demand to the rich man), but the preacher handles it as a structural reality of faith rather than a personal trap for the listener."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' By utilizing an Adult-to-Adult transaction, the preacher respects the autonomy of the listener. The use of Kierkegaard provides a cognitive map that allows the listener to locate themselves without feeling shamed. The preacher successfully deconstructs the 'Critical Parent' (the God of score-keeping) and invites the listener into a 'Free Child' relationship with the Divine (wonder and awe).",
    "strengths": [
      "High transparency and intellectual honesty.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The intellectual density (Adult) might overwhelm the 'Free Child's' need for simple, evocative imagery.",
      "The 'perhaps' of Amos could be explored for its potential to trigger anxiety in the 'Adapted Child'."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' language to maintain the Adult-Adult level. Ensure that the 'free fall' into mystery is not presented as a new 'rule' to be followed, which would inadvertently trigger the Critical Parent."
