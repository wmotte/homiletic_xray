  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of 'Trauma-Informed Law.' It uses a high-stakes personal narrative (a child's potential brain tumor) to bypass the listener's Adult ego and trigger a fear-response in the Child ego. By the time the 'Good News' is delivered, the listener has been psychologically 'broken down' so that the relief of the Gospel feels like a medical acquittal. While theologically orthodox in a Lutheran/Pauline sense, it is psychologically coercive, fostering dependency on the 'Rescuer' rather than developing an Adult-Adult relationship with the Divine.",
    "strengths": [
      "High emotional resonance and vulnerability.",
      "Effective use of metaphor to bridge abstract concepts with lived experience."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on the 'Terminal Illness' metaphor for sin, which strips the listener of agency.",
      "Heavy use of 'Critical Parent' language ('must,' 'no escape whatsoever')."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation's Adult ego by presenting the choice of 'life in Christ' as an invitation to growth and responsibility, rather than just an escape from a 'terminal' diagnosis. Reduce the use of fear-based medical trauma to 'bait' the listener into a state of helplessness."
