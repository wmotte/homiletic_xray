        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher explicitly disavows the role of the judge ('not to persuade you,' 'not liberal or conservative'). However, he utilizes the 'Dreadful Voice of Yahweh' as a proxy for the Critical Parent to deliver the judgment, effectively distancing his own ego from the coercion.",

        "presence": "Medium",
        "analysis": "The Nurturing Parent is projected onto the character of God and the 'New David' (Jesus). The care is supportive of the 'marginal,' aiming for autonomy and justice rather than smothering pity.",

        "analysis": "While the tone is serious, the invitation to 'slip it into your imagination' and the use of the 'Hey, kings' colloquialism shows a Free Child spontaneity that breaks the rigidity of the tradition.",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a model of psychologically healthy homiletics. It avoids the common trap of the Critical Parent (moralizing) and the Nurturing Parent (infantilizing). By addressing the 'Adult' in the pew, the preacher respects the listener's autonomy. The use of the 'Drama Triangle' is avoided by shifting the focus from personal guilt to systemic 'justice,' and by framing the 'crisis' as an objective reality to be navigated rather than a personal failure to be punished.",
    "strengths": [
      "High respect for the listener's Adult ego.",
      "Clear identification and rejection of fear-based (Adapted Child) motivation.",
      "Transparency regarding the preacher's own aims."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Dreadful Voice of Yahweh' section could inadvertently trigger an Adapted Child response in sensitive listeners.",
      "The transition from 'not liberal or conservative' to 'policy' is a sharp turn that may feel like a 'Switch' to some."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name the 'fears' explicitly; it helps the listener move from the Child ego to the Adult ego by making the emotion an object of study rather than a state of being."
