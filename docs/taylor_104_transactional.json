    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically robust, avoiding the common traps of religious manipulation. By using a 'We' orientation, the preacher bypasses the Critical Parent/Adapted Child dynamic. The focus on the 'agony of suspense' and 'seedtime' promotes an Adult reality-testing of the current social situation, validating the pain of the listeners without trapping them in a Victim role. It transforms a 'bitter plight' into a purposeful, redemptive agency.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'We' inclusive language. To further strengthen the Adult-Adult transaction, provide concrete examples of how 'tilling the soil' looks in the present moment."
