Thornton Wilder has a one-act play [...] For along this way of life there are many people who are deeply hurt, and when they are met by one who has also been hurt and who out of that hurt is ready to help, great healing occurs."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Revelation 5:9 as a springboard for a general theme of 'suffering as power.' It fails to identify what is unique to this text compared to other biblical passages on suffering. It treats the 'book' and 'seals' as mere 'mysterious and cryptic' stage props rather than investigating their specific redemptive-historical meaning.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are not told what the book means nor its significance for us and our salvation.",
        "The chapter talks about a book sealed with seven seals."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the specific content of the 'book' in the context of Revelation (God's plan for history) and explain why only the Slain Lamb—and no other biblical figure—can open it."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Exegesis is largely absent. There is no mention of the Greek context, the specific situation of the seven churches, or the apocalyptic genre. The preacher admits to not knowing what the central symbols mean, which Dekker would find professionally negligent.",
      "quotes": [
        "Like most of the book, this chapter is wrapped in strange and solemn figures and symbols.",
        "The scene is a mysterious and cryptic one."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Research the significance of the 'Lamb as it had been slain' in the context of the Paschal imagery and the Roman imperial cult that the original readers faced."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application is psychological and existential. While it attempts to speak to the 'zeitgeist' of avoiding pain, it remains somewhat general. It moves into a 'heroism of the soul' rather than a concrete application of the Gospel to specific modern societal or ecclesiastical situations.",
      "quotes": [
        "We go through life trying to avoid all situations that might involve damaged emotions and bruised feelings.",
        "True living consists of risking grandly, not pettily and miserly."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond general psychological advice about 'risking' and apply the text to concrete modern 'misery' or specific ethical choices facing the congregation."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured in blocks: a literary illustration, a brief retelling of the text, and then a long moral/psychological application. The hearer is not 'drawn into the text' so much as the text is used to validate a pre-existing philosophy of 'healing through hurting.'",
      "quotes": [
        "At this juncture in the strange pageant...",
        "I would like a life like that. Wouldn't you?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Integrate the application into the reading of the text itself, showing how the specific details of the heavenly vision 'expound' the hearer's current reality."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The 'misery' is present as psychological pain and 'wounds,' but it lacks the depth of 'misery before God' (sin). Redemption is presented as Christ's example of suffering which gives us power, bordering on a moral influence theory rather than an objective redemption from sin.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is your very remorse that makes your low voice tremble into the hearts of men.",
        "I believe you, Father, can get more glory out of my life since the scar has come."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the concept of 'misery' to include the 'captivity of sin' mentioned briefly, rather than just emotional 'bruises'."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "There is no sense of being 'lost' in the Dekkerian sense. The 'two ways' are reduced to 'true living' (risking) versus 'sliding through days' (avoiding pain). The ultimate stakes of life and death, or temporal/eternal loss, are absent.",
      "quotes": [
        "So we go sliding through the days, but this is not living.",
        "True living consists of believing greatly, not narrowly..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the seriousness of the 'seals' and the judgment they contain; show that the choice to follow the Lamb is a matter of life or destruction, not just 'better' living."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the 'telos' and is central to the imagery. However, the sermon risks making Christ a model for our own 'power-through-suffering' rather than the unique Savior. The focus shifts from what Christ did for us to how we can be like Him to help others.",
      "quotes": [
        "The marks of power were in the scars.",
        "Each of us can have a spiritual power to make people feel a little better..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Emphasize that Christ’s wounds are 'for us' (extra nos) to achieve what we cannot, rather than simply being a template for our own 'wounded healer' status."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1150 words, the sermon would take about 11-12 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for theological depth.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section and the theological implications of the 'new song' to reach at least 20 minutes of substantive proclamation."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily due to its brevity, lack of rigorous exegesis, and a tendency toward psychological moralism. It treats the biblical text as an illustration for a general truth about suffering rather than a unique revelation. The 'two ways' and the gravity of being 'lost' are entirely missing, replaced by a call to 'live grandly.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong central metaphor (the 'scarred hands') that remains tied to the Lamb imagery.",
      "Clear attempt to connect the biblical narrative to the emotional reality of the hearer.",
      "Avoids overly 'objective' preaching by focusing on the subject's response to pain."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (11 minutes) prevents the 'breadth' Dekker requires.",
      "Exegetical surrender: admitting the text is 'cryptic' instead of explaining it.",
      "Substitution of 'psychological help' for the 'proclamation of the Word of God'.",
      "Lack of the 'seriousness of the two ways'; no mention of the consequences of the seals remaining closed."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'speech about a biblical idea' rather than a sermon in Dekker's formal sense. It lacks the specific 'NOWHERE else' quality of the text and functions more as an inspirational talk on the value of suffering than an exposition of the Word of God."
