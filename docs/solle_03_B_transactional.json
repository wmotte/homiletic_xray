    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically remarkably healthy. It avoids the 'Critical Parent' trap common in environmental preaching (shaming). Instead, it uses the 'Nurturing Parent' to provide safety and the 'Free Child' to inspire hope and creativity. It treats God as a dynamic entity capable of change, which mirrors the psychological growth expected of the listener. The focus is on 'remembering' and 'perceiving' rather than 'obeying,' which fosters autonomy.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong appeal to the Free Child through sensory language.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'We' language and invitations to 'Remember' rather than 'Must' commands. This maintains the Adult-Adult/NP-FC balance and prevents the Drama Triangle from forming."
