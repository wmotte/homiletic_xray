      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience primarily through historical visualization and local contextualization. The preacher attempts to make the ruins of Ephesus tangible and connects the biblical 'church' to the immediate physical presence of the congregation in Brooklyn. However, it lacks a specific, modern narrative 'slice of life' that would allow for deeper emotional identification beyond the ecclesiastical setting.",

        "Even when one sees the ruins of Ephesus, they are impressive. Its amphitheater, with its tiers of seats, is preserved almost intact, though in ruins.",

He explores the 'why' of social tension and the internal 'anguish' of the believer who fails to live up to their calling, avoiding premature easy answers.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of the African-American prophetic tradition, balancing social observation with biblical exposition. It falls short in providing concrete, non-metaphorical application (Active Experimentation), relying instead on powerful imagery to motivate the hearer. The Reflective Observation is particularly effective, offering a sober analysis of the 'bruised' city and the 'anguish' of the believer. The Abstract Conceptualization is functional, focusing on translational accuracy to emphasize the text's gravity. The sermon completes the Kolb cycle, but the final phase is more of a spiritual 'charge' than a practical 'plan'. The movement through Anderson’s quadrants is clear, culminating in a Visionary climax that addresses the Diverging learning style effectively.",

      "Use a modern 'slice of life' story to initiate the Concrete Experience phase."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is homiletically effective in its ability to inspire and provoke reflection. From a Kolb perspective, it successfully moves the hearer from the 'ruins' of the past and the 'bruises' of the present toward a vision of Christ-centered power. However, the diagnostic reveals a gap in the Pragmatic/Converging quadrant; the preacher provides the 'why' and the 'what' with clarity but leaves the 'how' largely in the realm of metaphor. For a more holistic learning experience, future sermons should aim to bridge the gap between the 'Jesus train' and the specific ethical challenges of the Brooklyn streets with more concrete behavioral handles."
