    "summary": "The sermon is intellectually stimulating and structurally sound, primarily operating from an Adult ego state to analyze history. However, it leans heavily on a Critical Parent voice to drive home social applications. It risks the game of 'Ain't It Awful' by focusing extensively on the 'toxic' and 'distorted' nature of the current system, which can lead to listener paralysis or 'Adapted Child' compliance rather than 'Free Child' transformation.",

      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement with biblical and historical texts.",
      "Clear call for personal and institutional responsibility."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "High frequency of 'Critical Parent' adjectives (toxic, distorted, greedy, hostile).",
      "Lack of 'Free Child' spontaneity or grace-based motivation that isn't tied to a 'must' of reform."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward a 10, the preacher could invite the congregation's Adult to find their own 'neighborly' solutions rather than prescribing the specific political/economic categories, and increase the Free Child element by celebrating existing moments of grace without immediate 'Critical Parent' caveats."
