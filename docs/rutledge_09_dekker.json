To him be the dominion for ever and ever. Amen."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon focuses on the pericope from 1 Peter 5. It identifies the unique 'cosmology' of the text regarding the devil. However, it drifts into generalities about 'resistance' and 'suffering' that could be found in other epistles or Hebrews, rather than isolating what is unique to this specific Petrine image of the roaring lion.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let us therefore listen once more to a portion of the reading from the first epistle of Peter: 'Be sober, be watchful...'",
        "The great Adversary is part of the New Testament cosmology, and although many have tried to tell the story without him, it really can’t be done."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Sharpen the distinction between the 'roaring lion' of Peter and other biblical metaphors for evil. Why does Peter use this specific image here?"
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher relies heavily on secondary commentaries (Harink, Selwyn) rather than direct engagement with the Greek text or the specific historical-religious context of the Petrine community. The mention of the Gestapo is an application, not exegesis of the original context.",
      "quotes": [
        "One of the great commentaries on I Peter was written in England by E. G. Selwyn during World War II.",
        "Peter’s picture of the lion 'expresses the fell and deliberate purpose of the malignant Power of Evil.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate direct exegesis of the Greek terms for 'sober' (nēpsate) and 'watchful' (grēgorēsate) to ground the sermon in the original apostolic instruction."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Application is the strongest element. The preacher connects the text to Rwanda, the KKK, and the post-Christian shift in North America. It avoids generic 'be good' advice, though it occasionally lapses into broad categories like 'poverty' and 'hunger' without specific local traction.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have seen him, I have smelled him, and I have touched him. I know the devil exists...",
        "this is going to be very, very difficult for the American church because we are so accustomed to thinking of America and Christianity as almost synonymous."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond global examples (Rwanda, KKK) to the specific 'irrational prejudices' or 'lions' facing the specific congregation in Ontario."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon alternates between stories and text. While not a strict 'block' structure, the stories (Loch Ness, Rwanda) often dominate the text rather than the text expounding the stories. The hearer is drawn into the 'world' of the sermon, but perhaps more into the world of the preacher's anecdotes than the text itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "Here’s a story about the devil. A Scottish professor...",
        "That brings us to a corresponding theme in I Peter... the theme of suffering."

      "improvement_point": "Ensure the biblical text remains the subject of the sentence more frequently, rather than the anecdotes."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The 'misery' (the devil/suffering) is taken very seriously. Redemption is located in the 'God of all grace.' Gratitude is expressed through 'true worship.' The psychological reality of fear and resistance is well-handled.",
      "quotes": [
        "The church resists, endures, and conquers not through its own efforts... but because of the call... of God.",
        "The first order of worship is the triune God alone, God as he is in himself..."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "Strong adherence to this thesis. The preacher explicitly rejects 'bland spirituality' and emphasizes the 'apocalyptic collision.' The possibility of being 'devoured' (lost) is treated with the seriousness Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have been fooled by a veneer of generic, bland 'spirituality' that has no devouring enemies.",
        "The Christian life is a call to resistance."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is present as the 'pioneer' and the 'living stone,' but the sermon leans heavily on the 'God of all grace' (Theocentric) and the 'Devil' (Diabolic). Christ as the specific mediator of the two natures is assumed rather than articulated as the telos.",
      "quotes": [
        "The church lives out of... its foundation upon the 'living stone' (I Pet. 2:6), which is Christ.",
        "looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith..."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1650 words, the sermon likely clocks in under 17 minutes. According to Dekker's Thesis 8, this lacks the 'breadth' required for true depth. The use of multiple long anecdotes consumes time that could have been used for deeper exegetical 'exposition'.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Extend the length to at least 20 minutes by deepening the exegetical analysis of the text's specific vocabulary."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a serious attempt at proclamatory preaching that takes the reality of evil and the necessity of grace seriously. It falls short primarily on the formal requirements of length and the depth of original-language exegesis. While the application is concrete and avoids liberal platitudes, the sermon relies too heavily on external anecdotes (Rwanda, Lewis, Stott) rather than allowing the specific Petrine text to generate its own current word.",
    "strengths": [
      "Refusal to sanitize the 'demonic' or the 'adversary', meeting Dekker's demand for taking the 'two ways' seriously.",
      "Clear rejection of man-centered 'spirituality' in favor of a Trinitarian/God-centered focus.",
      "Concrete application regarding the 'post-Christian' context and the idolatry of national identity."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (under 20 minutes) to achieve the 'breadth' Dekker requires.",
      "Lack of direct engagement with Hebrew/Greek or the specific historical context of the first readers.",
      "Over-reliance on secondary literature and anecdotes which occasionally overshadow the specific Bible passage."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a substantial speech that approaches the definition of a sermon, but it functions more as a theological reflection on a theme (Resistance/The Devil) than a rigorous exposition and application of the specific Petrine text. It lacks the formal 'bicycle wheel' precision Dekker demands of a minister."
