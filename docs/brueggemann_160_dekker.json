(v. 11) As you know, I did not pick these verses; they were given to me . . . [...] The footnote comes at the end of the poem. It is a hard word with a footnote that we may receive in wisdom against all the foolishness around us. Jeremiah sees that there are very many foolish people. God is on the lookout for a few wise people who will make an effective difference."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon identifies the specific imagery of Jeremiah 4 (hot wind, weapons, undoing of creation). However, it struggles with the 'nowhere else' criterion. The preacher treats the text as a general 'wake-up call' or a poem about 'big trouble,' which could apply to many prophetic texts. The unique horror of the 'un-creation' in Jeremiah 4 is noted but quickly generalized into contemporary categories.",
      "quotes": [
        "The poetry intends to terrify ancient Jerusalem as a wake-up call.",
        "The poet saw a deep dismantling of creation."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more sharply on the specific linguistic reversal of Genesis 1 in Jeremiah 4:23-26 to show why *this* specific text is the only one that describes the 'undoing' of the cosmos so radically."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher understands the historical context (Babylon/Iraq) and the literary genre (poetry). However, there is no evidence of the 'Hebrew and Greek' requirement or deep engagement with the specific theology of the book of Jeremiah. The exegesis remains at a surface level of 'poetic imagination.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The wind and the weapons refer to mighty Babylon, a threat to ancient Jerusalem in the territory that we now call Iraq."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the specific covenantal logic of Jeremiah. Why is God 'fed up'? Moving beyond 'recalcitrance' to the specific breach of the Torah would strengthen the exposition."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is problematic according to Dekker's criteria. The preacher explicitly states 'We cannot apply this text,' which contradicts Thesis 3. When application does occur, it lists general categories (women, Blacks, poor, gays, Muslims) or general political stances (official violence, global warming) rather than concrete spiritual application for the specific congregation.",
      "quotes": [
        "We cannot “apply” this text. We cannot read it as though it were contemporary...",
        "...at various times women and Blacks and poor people, gays, and Muslims, whoever is on “the rejection list.”"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Abandon the claim that the text cannot be applied. Use the specific 'undoing of creation' to address the specific 'narcoticized' state of the current congregation's spiritual life."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured in blocks (I, II, III, IV). There is a clear separation between 'what the poet saw' and 'here we are.' The preacher treats the text as an object to be 'listened to' or 'haunted by' rather than a word that 'expounds' the hearer in the moment of proclamation.",
      "quotes": [
        "But we can listen to it. We can be haunted by it.",
        "So here we are, with this poem of alarm..."

      "improvement_point": "Avoid the 'museum-approach' where the text is an old poem we look at. Speak the judgment and the 'yet' directly to the congregation as a present Word of God."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'misery' (the undoing of creation/judgment) is strongly present. 'Redemption' is found in the 'footnote' of verse 27. 'Gratitude' is framed as 'changed conduct.' However, the misery is often externalized (9/11, environmental crisis) rather than being the hearer's misery 'before God.'",
      "quotes": [
        "“How bitter it is; it will reach deep in your heart”",
        "“Yet, I will not make a full end.”"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' by showing how the congregation's own 'arrogance and indifference' (v. 22) leads to the undoing, rather than just observing it in the world."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses the categories of 'fool' vs 'wise,' which aligns with the two ways. It mentions the possibility of being 'lost.' However, it softens the blow by suggesting the 'two ways' are just 'attitudes' or 'life designs' rather than the ultimate seriousness of being lost before God.",
      "quotes": [
        "The fool can say in arrogance, “There is no God.” Or the fool can say in despair, “There is no God.”",
        "God is on the lookout for a few wise people who will make an effective difference."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Christ is introduced late and somewhat artificially by 'morphing' to the Gospel reading. He is presented as a 'welcomer of sinners' (a theme) rather than the 'telos' of the Jeremiah text itself. The doctrine of the two natures is absent; Christ is a figure of inclusion rather than the Lord who is our life outside ourselves.",
      "quotes": [
        "When we morph to the Gospel reading, we meet the one who welcomes sinners...",
        "Jesus was preoccupied with the company of sinners..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect Christ to the 'Yet' of Jeremiah 4:27. Show how Christ *is* the reason God does not make a 'full end,' rather than just switching to a different story about inclusion."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1150 words, the sermon would take about 11-12 minutes. This is significantly below Dekker's 20-minute minimum. The lack of 'breadth' results in a lack of 'depth,' particularly in the exegesis and the theological connection between the Old Testament judgment and the New Testament grace.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section to explore the Hebrew imagery and the dogmatic section to link the 'undoing of creation' to the 'new creation' in Christ."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily in its length, its explicit refusal to 'apply' the text, and its thematic rather than telic use of Christ. It functions more as a literary reflection on a 'hard poem' than as a proclamatory Word of God that recreates the Scripture into a current word. While it captures the 'misery' of judgment well, it fails to interweave exposition and application, resulting in a detached, observational tone.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong focus on the specific imagery of the 'hot wind' and 'un-creation' in Jeremiah 4.",
      "Effective use of the 'misery' category through the description of a 'narcoticized' people.",
      "Clear identification of the 'adversative conjunction' (Yet) as the turning point of grace."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (approx. 11 min) prevents the 'breadth' required for theological depth.",
      "Explicit denial of the possibility of application (Thesis 3).",
      "Christ is treated as a secondary theme rather than the theological goal (telos) of the sermon."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the full sense of Dekker’s definition. It is an insightful homiletical essay or a 'speech about a biblical character/idea,' but it lacks the formal rigor of interwoven exposition-application and the substantive weight of a Trinitarian, Christ-centered proclamation that takes 20+ minutes to unfold."
