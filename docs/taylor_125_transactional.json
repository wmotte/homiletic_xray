    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a model of psychologically healthy communication. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent (shaming the congregation for not being 'holy' enough) and instead uses the Adult ego state to analyze reality. By admitting his own prejudices and 'little strength,' the preacher levels the playing field, creating a safe space for the congregation to exercise their own autonomy. The focus on 'little strength' vs 'no strength' is a powerful move to pull the listeners out of a 'Victim' position in the Drama Triangle.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of self-disclosure and vulnerability.",
      "Use of Adult data to challenge emotional biases.",
      "Empowerment of the listener through small, achievable goals."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'I will get in touch with that police official' could slightly foster dependency if not careful.",
      "The transition between the drug trade and the Jewish community's voting is a bit abrupt."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'we' instead of 'you' when discussing moral failings. Keep providing the 'Adult' data (etymology, statistics) as it grounds the 'Parental' moral imperatives in reality."
