    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in Passion Sunday homiletics. By operating from the Adult ego state, the preacher respects the listener's agency. The sermon successfully bridges the gap between literal reality (thirst, environmental crisis) and spiritual metaphor without using guilt as a lever. It avoids the 'Bait & Switch' by being honest about the 'utter degradation' of the cross from the start.",

      "The transition to the 'environmental disaster' could potentially trigger an 'Ain't It Awful' game if not balanced with the final message of hope.",
      "Slightly more 'Free Child' spontaneity could balance the heavy intellectual 'Adult' analysis."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using the 'I wonder' phrasing; it is a powerful tool for maintaining Adult-Adult transactions as it invites the listener into a shared space of discovery rather than a submissive space of receiving dogma."
