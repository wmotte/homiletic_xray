    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically heavy, relying on a dominant Critical Parent ego state to drive the congregation toward 'repentance.' While it uses compelling imagery and Adult-level historical data, the underlying dynamic is one of 'shaming' the listener's modern life (shopping, baking) to create a 'dissonance' that only the preacher's 'Advent frontier' can resolve. This creates a dependency on the preacher's 'shock' to maintain spiritual vitality.",

      "High reliance on guilt and fear ('not safe days to be in church').",
      "Binary framing of the world (Brutality vs. Self-indulgence) ignores the Adult reality of nuanced living."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try moving from 'Critical Parent' to 'Adult' by asking the congregation how they navigate the tensions of the season, rather than telling them they are 'vipers.' Replace the threat of 'wrath' with an invitation to 'Free Child' joy that isn't dependent on consumerism."
