[...] We cannot bring to pass the things God will have happen. We can open up the highways upon which his purposes might move. This our calling.",

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with historical 'slices of life' (Sarajevo, Paul at Troas) to anchor the listener. However, it lacks a deeply personal 'hook' that connects to the immediate, everyday emotional life of the modern hearer. The description of John the Baptist's appearance provides sensory detail, but the identification remains somewhat distant and observational rather than visceral.",
      "quotes": [
        "In the obscure town of Sarajevo in eastern Europe, an archduke was killed.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher pauses to analyze the human condition, specifically the 'incurable disease' of power and the tendency to cling to the past. He offers a cultural critique of the 1960s/70s generation gap, looking at the 'why' behind the friction between older and younger generations.",
      "quotes": [

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon identifies a 'big idea': that God's Word bypasses established power to work through the marginal. However, the exegesis of Luke 3:1-2 is more illustrative than deep. The theological framework of 'Kairos' is introduced but not fully developed into a robust dogmatic structure.",

      "analysis": "The sermon ends with a call to 'prepare the way,' but the application remains largely metaphorical and general. While it mentions 'civil rights' and 'poverty' earlier, the concluding call to action lacks specific, 'Monday-morning' steps for the congregation.",

The preacher effectively uses historical anecdotes and vivid imagery to engage the 'Diverging' and 'Assimilating' learners, but the 'Converging' and 'Accommodating' learners—those who need to know 'how' to act—are left with metaphors rather than methods.

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a rhetorically sophisticated piece that functions well as a prophetic 'wake-up call.' From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon, excelling in reflection and conceptualization but tapering off when it reaches the point of application. It successfully moves the hearer to see the world differently (Reflective Observation) and to understand God's role in it (Abstract Conceptualization), but it stops short of helping the hearer live differently (Active Experimentation). To reach a higher level of homiletical effectiveness, the preacher must bridge the gap between the 'lightning' of God's Word and the 'earth' of daily Christian practice."
