    "sermon_start_end": "NAAMAN THE Syrian was a five-star general of the army. He was commander of all the armed forces of the king of Syria. The troops under him had achieved massive victories. We’re told that “Naaman was a mighty man of valor.” All Damascus stood in awe of him. [...] God shows his love not by overwhelming us with demonstrations of power and majesty, not by clubbing us to our knees, not by staging exhibitions of supernatural strength such as we humans might expect God to do, but rather by coming alongside us with water, and bread, and wine."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon stays close to the narrative of 2 Kings 5. It identifies the unique tension of the 'but' in Naaman's life and the irony of the 'nobody' characters. However, it borders on using Naaman as a 'biblical character' archetype rather than extracting what is exclusive to this text.",
      "quotes": [
        "In every life there is a but. What is your but? What is my but?",
        "Consider Naaman’s slave girl. She is a quadruple nobody."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Sharpen the focus on the specific 'Jordan' requirement—why this specific water and not just 'simplicity' in general."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Adequate understanding of the socio-political dynamics between Syria and Israel. The preacher recognizes the 'joke' at the expense of the ruling class. No direct use of Hebrew/Greek, though the theological weight of YHWH is mentioned.",
      "quotes": [
        "Those listening to this story as originally told would have understood that this is a great joke at the expense of the ruling classes.",
        "YHWH, the God who can kill and make alive."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exegesis of the 'seven times' dipping and the legal/ritual status of leprosy in Israel versus Syria to highlight the specific theological scandal."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application is somewhat dated (1980s references) and occasionally slips into generalities. While it attempts concreteness with 'CEOs' and 'Ralph Sampson', the spiritual application remains largely psychological ('your but').",
      "quotes": [
        "The CEO of the huge multinational corporation...",
        "Maybe it’s your teenage son, come home from a Young Life weekend..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the 'everyone has a problem' (the 'but') to the specific offense of the Gospel in the contemporary zeitgeist."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Strong interwoven structure. The preacher moves back and forth between the Syrian court and the modern boardroom. The hearer is drawn into the narrative flow.",
      "quotes": [
        "As the Tsarina of all the Russias went to Rasputin... so the general of the armies of Syria..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application doesn't interrupt the 'present of revelation' by becoming too anecdotal."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Misery is well-defined as the 'leprosy' of the soul. Redemption is external (the Word of the prophet). Gratitude is present in Naaman's confession, though the sermon ends more on the 'invitation' than the 'gratitude' of the healed life.",
      "quotes": [
        "the Bible presents leprosy as a metaphor for guilt, sin, and death.",
        "Now I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Strengthen the 'gratitude' aspect; how does the healed 'foreigner' live now in a Syrian context?"
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Weak. The sermon emphasizes God's 'radical freedom' and 'grace' to the point where the 'lostness' of turning away is minimized. The 'rage' of Naaman is noted, but the eternal stakes are soft-pedaled.",
      "quotes": [
        "Elisha... remains invisible, permitting Naaman this liberty to turn away from deliverance."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the reality of 'being lost in time' more sharply—what if Naaman had stayed in his rage? The 'two ways' must be a real choice."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, appearing at the end via the Luke 4 reference and the sacraments. However, the connection between Elisha's word and Christ's nature is more illustrative than dogmatic.",
      "quotes": [
        "Christ is his life. All of Scripture is the one garment in which the whole Christ comes to us.",
        "take and eat this, and be fed with the bread from heaven"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly link the 'God who kills and makes alive' in 2 Kings to the Resurrection of Christ to ground the grace dogmatically."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At approximately 2200 words, the sermon meets Dekker's requirement for breadth to achieve depth. It allows the narrative to breathe.",
      "improvement_point": "None required on length; maintain the pace."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong narrative exposition that respects the biblical text but falls short on the 'two ways' and the concrete 'misery' of the modern hearer. It relies heavily on psychological archetypes ('the but') which risks turning the sermon into a general truth about human struggle rather than a specific word from God. The Christological conclusion feels slightly tacked on through sacramental language rather than being the inevitable telos of the Elisha narrative.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective use of irony and narrative tension to mirror the biblical text.",
      "Adequate length allowing for theological 'breadth'.",
      "Clear identification of the 'scandal' of grace reaching the 'enemy'."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 'two ways' (the possibility of being lost) is underdeveloped.",
      "Application leans toward the psychological rather than the spiritual/dogmatic.",
      "The specific 'uniqueness' of this text (why Jordan? why seven times?) is under-exploited."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a functional sermon that meets the formal definition of exposition and application. However, to satisfy Dekker's criteria fully, it needs more 'sharpness' regarding the human condition of being lost and a less 'general' psychological application."
