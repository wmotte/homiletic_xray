    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The text fails Dekker’s first thesis fundamentally. It is not an exposition of one specific passage but a thematic lecture on the 'Epiphany season' using a collage of texts. It treats 'the gospel accounts' as a general category rather than recreating a specific Word for 'now'.",
      "quotes": [
        "In this chapter, we arrive at the Gospel accounts of Jesus’ public ministry",
        "All of this undergirds the various epiphanies of Jesus’ divine sovereignty that we see in the lectionary readings."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one pericope (e.g., Luke 4:18-32) and discard the survey of other Gospels to find what is unique to that specific moment."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is adequate knowledge of biblical theology and Greek terms (dunamis, doxa), but it remains at the level of a textbook. The exegesis serves a dogmatic point (Jesus' divinity) rather than letting the text's own historical particularity speak.",
      "quotes": [
        "Dunamis (power—a favored word of the apostle Paul) and doxa (glory-fied) are used to make the strongest possible impression",
        "The requirement of exposition implies that only those who know Hebrew and Greek... can make a sermon."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond defining terms to showing how the specific historical context of the Nazareth synagogue or the Capernaum roof-opening creates a unique theological tension."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Application is largely polemical against 'mainline denominations' or 'Jesus scholars.' It lacks the concrete, multi-faceted application Dekker demands (politics, personal sorrow, etc.). It remains a general truth about Jesus' identity rather than a concrete word for the hearer's life.",
      "quotes": [
        "Nowadays, the mainline churches often seem timid about proclaiming him as our living Lord",
        "In a time when the name of Jesus Christ is more often than not used as an expletive, Christians need confidence"

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The text is structured as a theological essay. Exposition and application are not mixed in a way that 'expounds' the hearer. The hearer is an observer of a theological debate rather than being drawn into the movement of the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "To be sure, it is not wrong to emphasize the content of this passage... However, the main thrust of the narrative..."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The element of 'misery' is present through the 'world under occupation' and 'demonic powers.' Redemption is clearly Christ's victory. However, it leans too heavily toward the 'objective' side, which Dekker warns against; the human subject is somewhat lost in the cosmic battle.",
      "quotes": [
        "The incarnate Son of God did not arrive in peaceful neutral territory, but in a world under occupation.",
        "He calls it the reign of Sin and Death, which holds humankind and all creation in bondage"

      "improvement_point": "Make the 'misery' more psychological and personal—how does this 'occupation' manifest in the hearer's own life today?"

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are hinted at through the 'command' that cannot be refused and the 'lethally controversial' nature of Jesus. However, the existential weight of being 'lost' is treated as a theological category rather than a present danger for the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus’ announcement should never be detached from its framing... so deliberately provocative that they rise up and try to lynch him."
      ],

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "This is the strongest point. Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon insists on the two-natures doctrine and the uniqueness of Christ's divinity. It successfully detaches man from himself and points to salvation outside himself.",
      "quotes": [
        "Christ is the telos of the sermon. Christ can only be the telos of the sermon when He is God.",
        "It is in knowing Jesus as the Son... that we come truly to follow him as participants in his victory over Sin and Death."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 14.5 minutes (1450 words), the text fails Dekker's 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for true 'depth'. It functions more as a short teaching or introduction than a full sermon.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exposition of a single text to allow for the necessary 'breadth' of application."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text falls short of being a 'sermon' according to Dekker's criteria, functioning instead as a theological essay or a 'speech about the gospel'. It lacks a single specific Bible passage as its foundation, opting for a thematic survey of the Epiphany season. While its Christocentric focus is robust and its understanding of the 'demonic' provides a necessary edge, it fails the formal requirement of length and the practical requirement of concrete, contemporary application.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christological focus (Thesis 7), correctly identifying Christ as the divine telos.",
      "Adequate background in biblical languages and theology (Thesis 2).",
      "Clear identification of the 'misery' of the human condition as a world under occupation (Thesis 5)."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Failure to focus on one specific Bible passage (Thesis 1.3).",
      "Insufficient length to achieve homiletic depth (Thesis 8).",
      "Application is too general and polemical rather than concrete and pastoral (Thesis 3)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon; it is a theological lecture. It fails the formal definition of 'exposition and application of a specific Bible passage' and lacks the required duration for depth. It is a 'speech about the gospel' rather than a 'recreation of the Bible into a new, current, proclamatory word'."
