    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. It utilizes a 'Fear-Relief' cycle that reinforces dependency on the Parent ego state. By defining the listener as inherently 'deficient in receiving love' and 'deep in sin,' it bypasses the Adult's capacity for self-reflection and growth, opting instead for a dramatic 'rescue' that keeps the listener in the role of a helpless Child.",

      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult invitation for the listener to take responsibility for their life."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as capable Adult subjects who can partner with God, rather than helpless victims of their own nature. Reduce the use of universalizing 'we are' statements that impose a specific psychological state (terror) on the listener."
