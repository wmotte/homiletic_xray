    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes effective, though somewhat traditional, imagery. It moves from the mundane (cutting grass, New York politics) to the cosmic (Niagara, the hollow of God's hand). Following Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell,' the preacher successfully 'paints' the biblical world, particularly in the description of the Exodus and the cosmic power of God. The imagery of the 'fleshpots of Egypt' and the 'hollow of the hand' provides a sensory anchor for abstract theological concepts of grace and sovereignty. However, some metaphors lean toward the conventional (e.g., 'lamps of heaven'), which prevents a higher score for originality.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is clear and largely avoids dense academic jargon, adhering to McEntyre’s 'stewardship of language.' However, it occasionally falls into 'Canaanite' dialect—traditional religious phrasing that assumes a high level of biblical literacy ('fleshpots,' 'meted out'). The precision is strongest when discussing the 'fair exchange' principle, where the preacher carefully distinguishes between human logic and divine grace. The use of the MLK Jr. reference adds a layer of historical and ethical precision, though the transition back to the 'cattle on a thousand hills' feels slightly less nuanced and more repetitive.",
      "quotes": [
        "The fair exchange principle was superseded by another principle.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest micro-aesthetic feature. It exhibits a clear rhythmic cadence, particularly in the 'celebration' at the end. The use of parallelism ('Able to raise... Able to heal... Able to supply') creates a staccato rhythm that builds energy. The preacher uses 'legato' phrasing for the more reflective sections on beauty and 'staccato' for the declarations of God's power. This musicality suggests an oral-aural performance intended to move the listener through sound as much as sense, aligning with Immink’s view of the sermon as a 'happening' in time.",
      "quotes": [
        "God owns the cattle on a thousand hills, owns the thousand hills, owns the sky over the thousand hills, owns the valleys underneath the thousand hills.",

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Distinctly oral language; the structure and rhythm are designed for the ear, not the eye."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7,
    "summary_language": "The sermon demonstrates a high degree of micro-aesthetic awareness, particularly in its musicality and rhythmic drive. While the imagery is effective, it relies heavily on traditional biblical tropes, which provides a sense of 'sober beauty' but lacks modern freshness. The language is accessible and carefully steered away from dry dogmatics, favoring a poetic-rhetorical style that honors the oral tradition. It successfully avoids 'paper language,' creating a text that is clearly intended to be a performance of the Word rather than a lecture."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a classic 'Lowry Loop' or 'Homiletical Plot' to an extent. It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with the 'tit-for-tat' logic, creating a conflict between human reason and divine grace. The movement from the 'unreasonableness' of love to the 'capacity' of God provides a journey. However, the middle section—specifically the transition from MLK Jr. to the bridesmaids—feels slightly disjointed. The 'turning point' is the shift from God's 'willingness' to God's 'capacity,' which leads to a high-energy conclusion. While it isn't a static three-point sermon, the thematic shifts are somewhat abrupt.",
      "quotes": [
        "We get confused when, for whatever reason, that principle is replaced by some other.",
        "Now, let me try to weaken my case before I advance it.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon performs 'reframing' (Cilliers) by taking the ancient promise of Isaiah 41 and placing it against the backdrop of modern economic logic ('quid pro quo') and American social struggle (MLK Jr.). It respects the 'strangeness' of the text by admitting that grace is 'unreasonable.' The integration of the Deuteronomy text to explain 'chosenness' is a sophisticated touch that adds depth to the Isaiah passage. It doesn't just confirm what the hearer knows; it challenges the hearer's reliance on 'fair exchange,' reframing reality as a space where God's 'limitless supply' overrides human scarcity.",
      "quotes": [
        "The 'fair exchange' theory of equal trading... is clear to all of us.",

        "Provide more concrete 'contextual' examples of where we need 'upholding' today, beyond the cosmic level."

      "reframing_present": "Yes, it reframes the human struggle for worthiness into a celebration of divine capacity."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "In terms of Ciska Stark’s 'open work of art,' the sermon is somewhat 'closed.' While it acknowledges the mystery of grace and the 'jury of history' regarding human decency, the final third of the sermon moves toward a very traditional, declarative, and 'sealed' conclusion. The preacher provides the answers with great rhetorical force, leaving little room for the hearer to sit with the 'unreasonableness' or the 'ambivalence' of their own lack of faith. It is a sermon of 'proclamation' more than 'invitation,' which is stylistically consistent with its tradition but aesthetically 'monovalent' in its ending.",
      "quotes": [
        "Which is no reason at all.",
        "I suggest that the jury of history is still out on our case.",
        "God is able to raise up a bowed-down head! Able to heal all manner of disease!"

      "strengths": [
        "The admission that grace is 'no reason at all' leaves a healthy theological gap.",

        "Allow the 'unreasonableness' to linger longer before moving to the 'proofs' of God's capacity.",

        "Balance the 'God is able' declarations with the reality of those whose 'heads' remain 'bowed-down'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily a closed work of art; it aims for 'persuasion' and 'celebration' rather than 'polyvalent interpretation'."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon’s structure is a compelling movement from the 'logic of the world' to the 'logic of grace.' It utilizes a narrative arc that successfully creates tension around the 'unbelievable' nature of God's promises. While it integrates context well—particularly through the lens of social history and common human experience—it ultimately closes the 'space for grace' with a highly declarative and traditional rhetorical finish. It functions more as a 'witness' (Long) than an 'open work' (Stark), prioritizing the certainty of the Gospel over the ambiguity of the human condition."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids religious kitsch by acknowledging the 'unreasonableness' of the gospel and the 'faults' of the human condition. It does not offer a 'cheap' happy ending; the reference to the 'jury of history' being out on American decency provides a gritty, authentic counterweight to the cosmic promises. However, the final 'celebration' risks a 'kitsch' element if the 'healing of all manner of disease' is taken as a literal, immediate promise rather than a metaphorical one. The preacher stays on the side of 'authentic emotion' by grounding the sermon in the 'mystery' of chosenness rather than sentimental platitudes.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'merry twinkle in his eyes' in the father's story leans toward sentimentalism.",
      "The 'lamps of heaven' and 'chariot' imagery can border on the clichéd 'religious beautiful'."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The honest admission: 'The Lord did not set his love upon you... But because the Lord loved you. Which is no reason at all.'",
      "The haunting question about whether MLK Jr. 'overestimated' American decency."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To further avoid kitsch, ensure that the 'God is able' section acknowledges the 'not yet' of suffering alongside the 'already' of God's power."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens a 'space for grace' by dismantling the 'quid pro quo' logic that often blocks the encounter with the Holy. By defining grace as 'unreasonable,' Cilliers' concept of 'reframing' is activated. However, the space is somewhat narrowed by the preacher's need to make the promise 'reasonable' through 'proofs' of God's capacity. The transition from 'mystery' to 'logic' (even if it is 'divine logic') tends to fill the space that grace usually occupies. The sermon is most 'spacious' when it dwells on the 'hushed and rising expectancy' of the Israelites in the desert.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tension is sustained well in the first half but resolved perhaps too quickly and rhetorically in the second.",
    "mystery_respected": "Mystery is explicitly named but then 'explained' through the lens of God's 'limitless supply'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails over moralization; the sermon is about God's capacity, not human effort.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'unbelievability' of the promise to stand as a mystery longer before providing the 'reasons' for its reasonableness."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of the 'rhetorical-narrative' style, balancing intellectual inquiry with emotional resonance. Its primary aesthetic strength lies in its musicality and its ability to reframe the 'unreasonable' nature of grace against a culture of 'fair exchange.' It avoids the pitfall of dry dogmatics by using vivid (if traditional) imagery and personal/historical anecdotes. However, it falls short of a higher score due to its somewhat 'closed' structure and its reliance on archaic rhetorical tropes that can occasionally feel like 'religious decoration' rather than fresh aesthetic insight. The sermon is a 'witness' that moves from the 'trouble' of human logic to the 'grace' of divine capacity, but it does so with a certainty that may leave less room for the modern hearer's lingering doubts.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rhythmic and musical cadence that builds to a powerful rhetorical climax.",
      "Effective 'reframing' of grace against the 'quid pro quo' logic of human society.",
      "Honest and gritty integration of historical context (MLK Jr.) to ground the theological claims."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Modernize imagery to move beyond KJV-era tropes and archaic pronouns.",
      "Create more 'openness' in the conclusion to allow the hearer to inhabit the mystery of grace.",
      "Smooth the transitions between the diverse 'pages' of the sermon (social, biblical, and cosmic)."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Rhetorical-Celebratory (influenced by the Black Preaching tradition and the New Homiletic).",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Four Pages' model of Paul Scott Wilson (Trouble/Grace balance) and the 'Performance' emphasis of Gerrit Immink.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who appreciate traditional oratorical power, those struggling with feelings of unworthiness, and those who value the intersection of faith and social history.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the 'unreasonableness' of God as a lingering question.",
      "Use more 'earthy' and contemporary metaphors for God's 'supply' (e.g., digital networks, renewable energy) to contrast with the 'cattle on a thousand hills'.",
      "Read the text aloud to identify where the 'wordiness' of the middle section can be trimmed to match the rhythmic tightness of the end."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically effective piece of 'sober-reformed' rhetoric that successfully challenges the hearer's logic of scarcity. While its form is somewhat traditional and its conclusion 'sealed,' the preacher’s stewardship of language and rhythmic control create a 'happening' where the 'holy' is proclaimed with conviction. It is a work that values the 'beauty of simplicity' and the power of the spoken word to reframe reality."
