    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating vivid, sensory-rich imagery that bridges the gap between the ancient text and modern reality. The preacher uses the 'eyes of Isaiah' as a lens to perceive contemporary idols. The imagery is not merely decorative but serves as a diagnostic tool. By juxtaposing the 'stench' of exploitation with the 'sweet-smelling sacrifices' of the market, the sermon achieves a high level of sensory engagement. The description of the ecstatic woman with the D-Mark note and the naked prophet Isaiah provides a stark, visual contrast that lingers in the mind. The 'painting' of Nicaragua's shop windows versus the street children with German pencils creates a cinematic quality that follows Paul Scott Wilson's 'show, don't tell' principle effectively.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise and avoids traditional 'Canaanite' jargon, opting instead for a sharp, socio-political vocabulary that is carefully defined within the theological framework. The preacher practices 'stewardship of language' by reclaiming words like 'idolatry' and 'magic' and applying them to modern phenomena like horoscopes and neoliberalism. There is a clear effort to avoid vague religious platitudes. However, the use of political terminology (Deregulierung, Neoliberalismus, Terms of Trade) borders on a different kind of jargon—secular-academic—which might obscure the 'holy' for some hearers, though it is used here with surgical precision to unmask 'kitsch' religiosity.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a rhythmic, almost litanic quality, especially in the sections where the preacher mimics Isaiah’s style ('Ihr Land ist voll...'). The use of parallelism and repetition creates a driving cadence that mirrors the 'overfilling' of society. The variation between short, punchy sentences ('Und der Christengott lächelte.') and longer, descriptive passages creates an effective 'staccato-legato' movement. The ending, with its rhythmic blessing using the feminine 'Sie' for God, provides a surprising and melodic resolution. It is clearly a text written for the ear, utilizing rhetorical echoes to build tension.",

    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The sermon demonstrates a high level of micro-aesthetic awareness. It successfully avoids religious clichés by employing a sharp, confrontational vocabulary that bridges the biblical world with the contemporary global economy. The imagery is sensory and provocative, particularly the 'nakedness' of Isaiah contrasted with the 'outfit' of modern man. The rhythmic repetition of 'Ihr Land ist voll' creates a compelling oral flow. While it occasionally dips into academic-political jargon, the overall linguistic care is exemplary, fulfilling McEntyre’s call for stewardship of the word."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear dramaturgical movement: it begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' (the text is already here, closer than we are), moves through a series of 'mirrors' (Hatuey, Nicaragua, the Wall), and culminates in a call for 'silence' and 'nakedness'. However, the structure is somewhat repetitive. It functions more as a thematic gallery of idols than a singular narrative journey. The 'turning point' is found in the shift from the 'fullness' of idols to the 'emptiness' of the prophet, but this transition feels more like a logical conclusion than a dramatic reversal. The energy remains high throughout, but the 'plot' is more of a downward spiral into the reality of sin before the final upward glance.",

        "Ich brauche diesen Text gar nicht herzubringen, er ist schon hier, mehr, als ich selber bin.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. It performs 'reframing' in the purest Cilliersian sense. The ancient agrarian context of Isaiah is not 'modernized' superficially but is shown to share a deep structural logic with modern global capitalism (the transition to money economy, the 'magic' of the market). The synthesis is organic; the preacher doesn't just apply the text to the context, but allows the context to be 'read' by the text. The 'Christengott' of the conquistadors and the 'Christengott' of the IMF are presented as the same idol. This creates a powerful 'inter-esse' space where the hearer is forced to see their own reality through a radical biblical lens.",

        "Jesaja greift vier Grundzüge der Kultur auf, in der er lebt... Ich versuche, die beiden Kontexte in eine Beziehung zu setzen.",

      "reframing_present": "Yes, a radical reframing of 'normality' as 'idolatry'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Aesthetically, the sermon leans towards being 'closed'. While it is an 'open work' in the sense that it invites the hearer to look through Isaiah's eyes, the preacher’s interpretation is very specific and politically charged. There is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or alternative interpretations of the economic data. The hearer is presented with a stark choice: the 'Christengott' of death or the 'God of Justice'. While this fits the prophetic genre, it risks becoming a 'coercive schema' (Stark). The ending, however, opens up a space for 'waiting' and 'silence', which mitigates the earlier dogmatic pressure, but the overall structure is more declarative than exploratory.",
      "quotes": [
        "Er beschreibt, wer wir sind, indem er sagt, wer unser Gott ist.",

        "The use of questions at the end invites personal reflection.",

        "The political analysis is very 'sealed'; it leaves little room for the hearer to disagree with the economic diagnosis.",
        "The sermon could benefit from more 'polyphony'—acknowledging the difficulty of living in these systems.",
        "The move to 'silence' at the end feels a bit like a 'prescribed' solution."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Monovalent and prophetic; more of a 'witness' than an 'open work of art'."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are dominated by a prophetic-confrontational structure. The integration of text and context is masterful, achieving a profound 'reframing' of modern life as a temple of idols. The narrative arc is effective but somewhat repetitive, functioning as a series of mirrors. While the sermon is rhetorically powerful, it is structurally 'closed', leaving little room for interpretative maneuver. It is a 'witness' sermon in the tradition of Thomas Long, where the form follows the judgmental and hopeful form of the prophetic text."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a powerful antidote to religious kitsch. It explicitly attacks the 'sweet-smelling sacrifices' and 'exquisite perfumes' of a religion that masks suffering. It refuses to offer 'immediate comfort' or a 'happy ending' that doesn't take the 'pain of suffering' (the street children, the burned Hatuey) seriously. By using the term 'Christengott' for the idol of the oppressors, it deconstructs the ultimate religious cliché. The emotion is authentic, born of 'fassinglosigkeit' (speechlessness) and shame, rather than manufactured sentiment. It sustains the tension of being 'trapped' in the land of idols without offering a cheap exit strategy.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'ecstatic sobbing' over the D-Mark (identified as kitsch/idolatry by the preacher).",

      "The image of Isaiah walking naked as a 'body prayer' of desperation."

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon creates 'space for grace' primarily by clearing away the 'clutter' of idols. Cilliers' concept of 'reframing' is present, but the 'space' created is very narrow and demanding. The sermon focuses heavily on the 'trouble' (the first three pages of Wilson's model), and the 'grace' appears only at the very end as a 'waiting' and 'hoping'. It avoids moralization in the sense of 'do more', but it borders on a 'moralization of the heart' (you must be silent, you must be naked). The 'mystery' of God is respected as the 'unavailable' one who is found in silence, but the path there is portrayed as extremely difficult for the 'rich'.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between wealth and faith are sustained with high intensity.",
    "mystery_respected": "God is kept as the 'Other' who cannot be manipulated by 'magic'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Prophetic judgment prevails over the proclamation of grace for much of the text.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'Space for Grace' to be felt earlier in the sermon, perhaps through the 'longing' (Sehnsucht) mentioned, rather than just at the conclusion."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically potent example of 'Prophetic-Political Homiletics'. Its primary aesthetic power lies in its radical 'reframing' of contemporary economic and social reality through the lens of ancient prophecy. The language is sharp, sensory, and rhythmic, successfully avoiding the 'kitsch' of conventional piety. It uses 'showing' through historical and contemporary anecdotes to make the abstract concept of idolatry palpably 'ugly' and 'deadly'. While the structure is somewhat repetitive and the tone is structurally 'closed' (leaving little room for the hearer's own interpretation), the aesthetic coherence is remarkable. The sermon does not 'beautify' the message but uses the beauty of simplicity and the shock of 'nakedness' to create a space where the 'Holy' might happen as an act of unmasking. It is a sober, 'Reformed' aesthetic that finds beauty in the truth of the cross and the justice of God rather than in liturgical decoration.",

    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'narrative' plot that follows a single character's journey through the idols.",
      "Use more 'silence' as a rhetorical device within the sermon itself.",
      "Explore the 'beauty' of the God of Justice more explicitly to provide a positive aesthetic counter-image to the idols."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically high-quality sermon that excels in unmasking the 'kitsch' of modern life. It achieves a 7.2 because it is a model of 'reframing' and linguistic stewardship, though it is slightly limited by its structural closedness and heavy reliance on political-economic analysis. It is a powerful 'event' of the Word that challenges the hearer's perception of reality."
