    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. While theologically orthodox in its focus on original sin, it utilizes the 'Critical Parent' to dismantle the listener's 'Adult' agency. By framing the world and the self as inherently 'sickness-unto-death,' it fosters a 'Victim' identity in the congregation. The 'Rescuer' role is then occupied by the 'Old Story,' which requires the listener to remain in an 'Adapted Child' state of dependency. The use of 'Ain't It Awful' creates a bond based on shared fear rather than shared hope.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as 'Adults' capable of making choices in the 'here-and-now.' Instead of using 'Sin' as a conversation-stopper that enforces passivity, present 'Grace' as a power that restores the 'Adult's' ability to act responsibly in the world."
