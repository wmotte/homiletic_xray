    "sermon_start_end": "The early church must have been haunted by the vision Peter had had with the snakes in a sheet. A voice had said to him: “What God has made clean, you must not call profane.” (Acts 11:9) The voice that haunted summoned Peter to depart in radical ways [...] These five years of incremental steps consist in hosting a haunting memory that shatters our comfort zones and that anticipates nonconformist neighbors who by their presence open up for us futures that take unimaginable form. Apostles do not simply reiterate; they go into new territory. As a result Jerusalem will never be the same again."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on one specific Bible passage. It oscillates between Acts 11, Acts 15, and Psalm 122. It treats the texts as illustrations for a general theme of 'adventure' and 'othering' rather than extracting what is unique to the specific wording of Psalm 122 or Acts 15. The distinctiveness of the text—what can be found nowhere else—is sacrificed for a general sociological observation about institutional change.",
      "quotes": [
        "if we read this narrative in juxtaposition with Psalm 122",
        "Our text arises from a haunting heavenly voice and neighbors who would not conform."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select either Psalm 122 or Acts 15. If Psalm 122, focus on the specific architectural and liturgical 'peace' of the city rather than using it as a foil for Acts."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher shows awareness of the historical tension regarding Gentile admission and the significance of Jerusalem as a 'citadel of shalom.' However, the exegesis is subservient to a modern ideological framework. The 'original context' is quickly bypassed to reach a contemporary analogy.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jerusalem, that great citadel of shalom, is mentioned twice and is the subject of the Psalm",
        "The city is linked to David and thrones and courts"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the linguistic analysis of 'Shalom' in the context of the Davidic covenant and the specific legal requirements of Acts 15 (the Apostolic Decree) instead of generalizing them as 'rule and regulation'."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete but borders on the 'general truths' Dekker warns against by turning the Gospel into a program for social inclusion. It identifies specific groups (Black, gay, Palestinian), which fulfills the requirement for concreteness, but the application is more political/sociological than spiritual/theological.",
      "quotes": [
        "whether a woman or a Black or a gay or, God forbid, a Muslim or a Palestinian",
        "I suggest that we need a five-year plan of incremental steps"

      "improvement_point": "Move beyond a 'five-year plan' for social change and address the spiritual state of the hearer before God in light of the text."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon moves back and forth between the biblical narrative and modern examples, but they remain parallel tracks. The text is used to validate a preconceived notion of 'adventure' rather than the text itself 'expounding' the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is like that when a new nonconforming member is admitted to the table",
        "The narrative of Peter... is an invitation to deep othering"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Allow the specific logic of the Bible passage to dictate the structure of the application, rather than imposing a modern 'adventure' narrative onto the text."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The categories of misery, redemption, and gratitude are almost entirely absent. 'Misery' is redefined as being 'stuck in tradition' or 'comfort zones,' and 'redemption' is seen as social progress or 'imagination.' This is a horizontal, human-centered approach that lacks the Trinitarian depth Dekker requires.",
      "quotes": [
        "shatters our comfort zones",
        "the impossible will have become possible"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the theological misery (sin, exclusion from God's presence) and the objective redemption in Christ's work, rather than human 'daring'."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are present only in a secularized form: the 'broad way' of stagnant tradition versus the 'narrow way' of the 'apostolic adventure.' The eternal or temporal seriousness of being lost before God is replaced by the risk of being on the 'wrong side of history' or institutional decline.",
      "quotes": [
        "Apostles do not simply reiterate; they go into new territory. As a result Jerusalem will never be the same again."
      ],

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "Christ is almost entirely silenced. The 'one Lord' is replaced by the 'apostolic adventure.' Grace is not the 'deepest of our life' here; rather, human 'imagination' and 'daring' are the drivers. The sermon is an exhortation to human action rather than a proclamation of Christ's finished work.",
      "quotes": [
        "The decision to admit Gentiles... was not a decision easily gained; it shattered all old categories",
        "The peace of Jerusalem... will consist in an open-ended venture of great imagination and daring."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly ground the 'othering' and 'inclusion' in the person and work of Jesus Christ as the one who breaks down the middle wall of partition."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The sermon is far too short. At approximately 650 words, it would take about 6-7 minutes to deliver. According to Dekker (and Miskotte), depth needs breadth. This text is a brief speech or reflection, not a sermon.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the sermon to at least 20 minutes (approx. 2000 words) to allow for genuine theological depth and detailed exposition."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text fails to meet the fundamental criteria of a sermon according to Dekker's theses. It lacks a single specific biblical focus, is significantly too short for theological depth, and replaces the proclamation of Christ and the three parts (misery, redemption, gratitude) with a sociological call to institutional change and social inclusion. It functions as a topical speech on 'change management' rather than a form of the Word of God.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete contemporary references prevent the sermon from being purely abstract.",
      "Clear identification of the tension between tradition and new developments in the early church."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extreme brevity (approx. 6 minutes) precludes the 'breadth' required for 'depth'.",
      "Absence of Christ as the telos; the focus is on human 'adventure' and 'imagination'.",
      "Theological categories (misery/redemption) are secularized into sociological categories (stagnation/progress)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is a brief topical address. It lacks the formal requirement of length and the substantive requirement of being centered on the 'one Lord' and the 'three parts'. It treats the Bible as a source of historical analogies for modern social ventures rather than as the living Word of God that 'expounds' the hearer."
