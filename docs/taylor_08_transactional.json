        "analysis": "The preacher provides comfort by emphasizing a stable, non-capricious God, promoting a sense of safety (security) without demanding dependency on the preacher.",

        "presence_of_adaptation": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher admits his own vulnerability ('all of us are [afraid]') which prevents a hierarchy of fear. However, there is a slight AC pull in the opening prayer's confession of not loving God 'as we ought.'",

    "communicative_purity_score": 9,
    "purity_explanation": "10 = Completely transparent. The sermon lacks the 'double bottom' of many religious texts; it does not use grace to hide a later demand for money or legalism.",
    "risk_explanation": "The only risk is a 'Bait & Switch' where the promise of 'Victory' might be interpreted by the listener's Child as a promise that no bad things will happen, though the Adult text denies this."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely game-free. It utilizes a strong Adult ego state to categorize and validate human fear while offering a Nurturing Parent perspective on the nature of God. It avoids the common trap of 'shaming' the listener for being afraid, instead treating fear as a natural instinct that can be integrated through faith. The preacher maintains a high degree of transparency and avoids the Drama Triangle by positioning himself alongside the listeners as a fellow traveler.",
    "strengths": [
      "Validation of 'legitimate fears' (Adult reality testing).",
      "Avoidance of 'magical thinking' or simplistic denial.",
      "Inclusion of the preacher in the human condition (I'm OK, You're OK)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The opening prayer leans slightly into 'Adapted Child' guilt ('we have not loved... as we ought').",
      "Could further empower the 'Free Child' by emphasizing the creativity and spontaneity that faith releases."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' language to maintain the Adult-Adult connection. Ensure that the 'Victory' mentioned at the end is clearly defined as an internal psychological/spiritual state rather than an external promise of safety, to avoid a 'Bait & Switch' payoff if the listener faces further hardship."
