However, it leans on a 'Critical Parent' tone when discussing the state of the modern church, potentially inducing guilt or a sense of inadequacy in the listener. It uses the 'Ain't It Awful' game to create a bond of intellectual superiority between the preacher and the congregation against the 'sorely lacking' outside world.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Avoid using the 'sorely lacking' state of others as a Gimmick to sell your solution. Instead of telling the congregation they 'should not be afraid of big words' (Parent), simply use the words and invite them to explore their meaning (Adult)."
