    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience primarily through historical and social reimagining rather than immediate personal anecdotes. It grounds the biblical narrative in 'bodily reality' and 'peasant economy,' making the ancient scene recognizable. However, it lacks a contemporary 'slice of life' hook in the introduction, opting for a lecture-style opening. The emotional connection is strongest when describing the Syrophoenician woman's desperation.",
      "quotes": [
        "And then he brings his kingdom talk down to bodily reality as he always does. No use to have grandiose expectations unless it matters on the ground.",
        "It was the kind of live-and-let-live of rural intimacy, all of one kind of people.",

      "homiletical_manifestations": "Manifests as a 'historical-social' hook, painting a picture of Galilee and the Decapolis as real, lived-in places."

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest phase. The preacher excels at pausing to ask 'why' and 'how' the transition from Chapter 6 to Chapter 8 occurs. He provides a sophisticated cultural critique of purity laws and social boundaries, helping the hearer observe the underlying patterns of exclusion that exist both in the text and in modern-day Louisville.",
      "quotes": [
        "Don’t you wonder how the narrative gets from chapter 6 to chapter 8? Well, it is by way of chapter 7.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon offers a clear 'big idea': Evangelical Geography—the truth that the Gospel is context-specific and boundary-crossing. The exegesis of Mark 6-8 is logically structured and theologically sound, moving from Jewish particularity to Gentile universality. It formulates a clear theological framework regarding the 'Eucharistic mantra' (took, blessed, broke, gave).",

        "The term 'Evangelical Geography' is slightly academic; a more accessible theological term might help some hearers.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "While the sermon ends with a powerful vision of a 'redrawn map,' it remains somewhat general in its call to action. It identifies 'what' needs to happen (redistribution of bread/well-being in Louisville) but offers fewer 'how-to' steps for the individual hearer. The call is more corporate/prophetic than individual/ethical.",

It falls short in providing concrete, individual application steps (Active Experimentation), opting instead for a broad systemic call to justice. It works exceptionally well as a piece of social and biblical analysis, using the 'geography' metaphor to bridge the ancient text and the modern city. The preacher functions primarily as a Sage/Philosopher, helping the congregation see the 'why' behind social exclusion. While the logic is impeccable and the vision is inspiring, the lack of pragmatic 'handles' may leave some hearers feeling overwhelmed by the scale of the problem without a clear path to contribute to the solution. The tone is sober and analytical, avoiding sentimentality while maintaining a firm ethical stance.",

      "Experiment with a more inductive 'Narrative' structure where the 'Geography' theory is the conclusion rather than the starting point."
    ],
    "conclusion": "From a Kolb perspective, this sermon is a high-quality 'Reflective' and 'Conceptual' piece that successfully re-maps the hearer's understanding of the Gospel. Its primary diagnosis is an imbalance toward the 'thinking/watching' quadrants at the expense of 'doing'. It effectively challenges the 'Assimilating' and 'Diverging' hearers but may fail to move the 'Converging' hearer toward action. The priority for improvement is the development of the Pragmatic task (Osmer) and the Active Experimentation phase (Kolb). By grounding the brilliant 'Evangelical Geography' in specific, local, and individual actions, the preacher could move this from a strong lecture-sermon to a transformative learning cycle."
