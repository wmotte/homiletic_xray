  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a robust exegetical framework by weaving together three distinct biblical witnesses: the eschatological vision of Revelation, the biographical transformation of Paul in Acts, and the personal lament/praise of the Psalmist. The 'Sache' is the ontological shift from 'Friday' (death/empire) to 'Sunday' (life/lamb). The theological depth is found in the definition of singing not as an aesthetic choice, but as a 'step outside settled logic.' However, the factual side occasionally leans into sociological generalizations (Baptist vs. Episcopal singing) which, while illustrative, risk oversimplifying the complexity of liturgical theology for the sake of a rhetorical point. The Barthian 'Living Christ' is present as the 'Acting Subject' who interrupts Paul and heals the Psalmist.",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a sophisticated, perhaps slightly cynical, intellectual persona. There is a clear 'Selbstenthüllung' of a person who is weary of 'routine' and 'unsingable songs,' suggesting a high value for authenticity over institutional tradition. The preacher positions themselves as a social critic and a theological guide. The 'I' is largely diaconal, serving the text, but the initial critique of the Episcopal Church reveals a specific ecclesiastical frustration. There is a sense of 'intellectual passion'—the preacher is moved by the *idea* of the outrage more than by a raw, emotional display of personal piety. The authenticity is found in the intellectual honesty regarding the difficulty of faith in an affluent context.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Episcopal Church whose hymnal has more unsingable songs than any other hymnal that I know.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching' and 'Provocative.' The preacher uses 'we' frequently, but it often feels like a 'rhetorical we' that includes the congregation in a critique of their own tepidness. By labeling the congregation's singing as 'feeble' due to 'affluence,' the preacher risks creating 'relationship noise'—the hearer might feel judged or stereotyped before the message of grace arrives. The tone is paternalistic in its sociological diagnosis. However, the shift toward 'ordinary folks like us' in the latter half attempts to bridge this gap and create a sense of solidarity in suffering and hope.",

        "The more affluent and sophisticated we are, the more feebly we sing.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The appeal is not a moralistic 'do better,' but a 'be transformed.' The preacher calls for a 'violation of ordinary reason.' The ratio of Zuspruch (Promise) to Anspruch (Demand) is well-balanced because the 'demand' to sing is presented as a response to the 'gift' of the Resurrection. The appeal is to 'defy' the empire, which is a high-level theological appeal. However, there is a subtle risk of a new law: 'If you are affluent, you must work harder to sing vigorously.' The preacher successfully avoids '7-11' moralism by grounding the action in the 'outrage of Easter.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Sing as though we are engaged in outrageous, dangerous action.",
        "It must be sung, because singing evokes energy.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This is a strong, intellectually stimulating sermon that successfully connects biblical theology with contemporary sociological reality. The preacher avoids the trap of simple moralism by framing the 'appeal' as a participation in the 'outrage' of the Resurrection. Theologically, it follows a Barthian trajectory where God (the Lamb) is the subject who turns mourning into dancing. However, the 'Yellow' side (relationship) is somewhat strained by a sharp, almost elitist critique of the congregation's liturgical habits. While this serves as a 'prophetic' provocation, it may cause some listeners to listen with a defensive 'Relational Ear.' The transition from the 'Empire' and 'Paul' to 'Ordinary folks' is the homiletical turning point that saves the sermon from becoming a mere lecture. The congruence is high, though the preacher’s own sophisticated delivery slightly belies the praise of 'unsophisticated' vigor.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon avoids psychologization by keeping the focus on the 'Lamb' and the 'Truth of God's life,' rather than just human feelings about singing.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Excellent use of the 'Friday/Sunday' framework.",
      "High theological 'Sache' (Factual Content).",
      "Effective integration of multiple scripture texts."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce denominational stereotyping to lower relationship noise.",
      "Bridge the gap between the preacher's sophisticated rhetoric and the 'vigorous' simplicity they advocate.",
      "Provide more 'Zuspruch' for the 'feeble' singer who feels judged by the opening sociology."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A high-quality homiletical performance that prioritizes the 'outrage' of the Gospel over the comfort of the congregation, achieving communicative integrity through theological rigor."
