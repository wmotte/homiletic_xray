    "risk_explanation": "The only risk is a subtle Nurturing Parent 'smothering' where the grace is so universal it might bypass the Adult's need for specific ethical decision-making, but the preacher counters this by mentioning 'action has to be taken against evil deeds'."

    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exceptional example of psychologically healthy homiletics. It utilizes the Adult ego state to dismantle the binary structures of the Critical Parent. By redefining repentance as 'insight' rather than 'groveling,' it promotes autonomy and self-awareness. It avoids the common 'Bait and Switch' game by maintaining a consistent message of universal need and universal grace, refusing to use the pulpit to persecute 'the others'.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'We' pronoun to maintain a level playing field and avoid the 'I'm OK, You're Not OK' trap of the Critical Parent."
