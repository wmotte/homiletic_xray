    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a clear, narrative-driven exegesis of Acts 16. The 'Sache' (the living Christ) is presented through the lens of liberation and social disruption. The factual side is strong in its structural mapping of the text's characters (fortune-teller, money men, magistrates, crowd) to modern equivalents. However, the dogmatic depth regarding 'salvation' is somewhat flattened into socio-ethical categories. While Barth would appreciate the focus on the 'Living Word' breaking into the world, the 'blue' side risks becoming a sociological lecture rather than a theological exposition of the 'fides quae'. The historical-critical distance is minimal; the text is immediately translated into a contemporary 'map'.",

        "These ingredients include: A slave-girl who did fortune-telling.",
        "The story does not speculate about the cause of the quake.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a persona that is deeply concerned with social justice and systemic critique. There is a conscious 'Selbstdarstellung' as a prophetic voice standing against 'the money men' and 'activist judges'. What 'leaks' unintentionally is a certain intellectual disdain for popular culture (talk shows, gadgets, sports spectacles). The 'I' is largely hidden behind the 'We' of the church, but the preacher’s personal political alignment is transparent. The self-revelation is not 'diaconal' in the sense of showing personal vulnerability; rather, it is a revelation of a specific ideological worldview.",
      "quotes": [
        "It strikes me that these five ingredients... provide a map for a very fearful society.",
        "What a strange bunch we are!",
        "They are perhaps 'activist judges' like our Supreme Court."

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive/Schizoid. The preacher seeks to 'order' the world through a rigid structural analysis (Compulsive) and maintains a certain analytical distance from the emotional interiority of the characters (Schizoid).",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The relationship to the hearer is primarily 'Teaching' and 'Provocative'. The preacher assumes a position of 'we' (the Jesus people) versus 'them' (the fearful society). This creates a solidary 'we-definition' for those who agree, but it may feel 'paternalistic' or exclusionary to those who do not share the preacher's specific political critiques. There is significant 'relationship noise' in the references to the Supreme Court and 'tea party crowds', which may cause the 'Relationship Ear' of some listeners to close due to feeling judged or stereotyped.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The appeal is directional: move from fear to freedom, from greed to generosity. Theologically, the preacher attempts to ground the 'Anspruch' (demand) in the 'Zuspruch' (Easter news). However, the appeal often feels like a call to 'sign on for another reading of reality', which can sound like an intellectual or behavioral requirement. The 'Zuspruch' is the fact that 'Jesus is loose', but the 'Anspruch' to reject 'electronic gadgets' and 'sports spectacles' carries a heavy moralistic weight. The risk of moralism is moderate; the listener is told what a 'Jesus person' does.",
      "quotes": [
        "He signed on for another reading of reality...",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 5.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a robust example of socio-homiletics. It succeeds in making a 2000-year-old text feel immediate and urgent. The preacher effectively uses Schulz von Thun's 'Blue' side to build a map of a 'fearful society.' However, the 'Yellow' side (relationship) is strained by specific political references that may alienate the very 'frightened people' the text seeks to address. Theologically, it follows a Barthian emphasis on the 'Living Word' (Jesus loose in the world), but it risks 'psychologizing' the Gospel into a new social mindset rather than a divine rescue. The 'Red' side is strong, but the 'Anspruch' (demand) occasionally overshadows the 'Zuspruch' (gift), making salvation feel like a social 'signing on' rather than a work of God. The congruence is high for a specific 'prophetic' type, but the 'Riemann' diagnosis suggests a compulsive need to categorize social evils, which may limit the sermon's pastoral reach.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a risk of pinning down 'revelation' to a specific social 'experience' or political stance, potentially making God an object of social critique rather than the Acting Subject.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Vivid contemporary application of biblical roles.",
      "Strong narrative flow and structural clarity.",
      "Bold challenge to the 'status quo' of fear."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce polarizing political 'noise' to widen the relational ear.",
      "Deepen the theological 'Zuspruch' (the 'Why' of the Gospel).",
      "Incorporate more personal vulnerability (diaconal self-revelation)."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A competent, sharp, but relationally risky sermon that prioritizes social appeal over pastoral breadth."
