    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Nurturing Parent' theology that utilizes 'Critical Parent' dogmatics to create a psychological need for the message. While it offers profound comfort (NP), it reinforces a sense of human inadequacy (AC) that can foster dependency. The transition from the 'desperate parent' analogy to the 'miserable offender' creates a psychological whiplash that serves the 'Redemption' game.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of empathy and Nurturing Parent metaphors.",
      "Effective Adult ego engagement through historical and textual analysis."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on the 'miserable offender' trope which can trigger shame-based Adapted Child responses.",
      "The Drama Triangle is heavily reinforced by keeping the listener in the 'Victim' position."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation's Adult ego more consistently. Instead of telling them they have 'no health' in them (CP), invite them to observe their own reality and choices (Adult) and how those choices align with the 'dynamic interrelatedness' of the Trinity."
