By framing life exclusively as a 'desert' and the listener as a failing 'Adam,' it triggers the Adapted Child's guilt. The solution provided (Jesus as the second Adam) is theologically sound but psychologically serves to close the 'Game' by providing a temporary relief from the guilt the preacher himself induced.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try speaking from the Adult ego position: instead of 'You must feel life is a desert,' ask 'How do you experience the tension between your faith and your daily reality?' This invites the listener into an Adult-Adult transaction of reflection rather than Child-like submission."
