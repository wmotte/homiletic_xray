  "aristotelian_modes_analysis": {
    "logos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The rational architecture is strong and follows a clear, deductive four-point structure. The preacher establishes a 'paradigm case study' (Peter) and systematically applies four principles: reality, achievement, pattern, and life. The logic is particularly robust when distinguishing between Jesus as a 'moral exemplar' versus a 'substitute,' using a legal analogy (the Costco receipt) to explain justification. However, the transition between the historical evidence for the resurrection and the internal 'pattern' of growth feels slightly compressed, as the preacher admits to covering a vast amount of ground 'briefly.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Here are the four principles we’ll learn here... you have to believe in the resurrection’s reality, you have to understand its achievement, you have to submit to its pattern, and you have to live its life.",
        "The resurrection is your proof that it was all paid for. That’s the reason why written into the foundation documents of the Christian church is that it’s not strong people who are saved.",
        "If Jesus Christ came as a moral exemplar... he’s a failure. In fact, he’s worse than a failure. He makes our failure look worse because his standard is so high we can’t reach it."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear four-point framework that provides a roadmap for the listener.",
        "Effective use of scholarly evidence (Richard Bauckham) to ground the historical claims.",
        "Strong logical distinction between 'salvation by works' and 'salvation by grace' through the lens of substitution."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The section on 'doing the hard work' of looking at evidence is mentioned but bypassed, which slightly weakens the rational defense of the first point.",
        "The transition from the 'shame and honor culture' analysis to the theological 'substitution' could be more fluid.",
        "The conclusion of the logical argument is somewhat rushed to fit the four-point structure."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The sermon possesses a highly coherent internal logic that prioritizes theological clarity and historical plausibility."
    },
    "pathos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The emotional resonance is effective but controlled. The preacher avoids manipulative sentimentality, instead using 'slices of life' like the Joni Eareckson Tada quote to evoke hope and the Dick Lucas story to evoke recognition of human irritability and the need for grace. The description of Peter’s failure—'man curved in on himself'—is designed to trigger a sense of recognition (shame/honit) in the hearer. While the sermon touches on deep themes of failure and restoration, the tone remains somewhat pedagogical, which creates a slight distance between the raw emotion of the text and the delivery.",
      "quotes": [
        "I, with shriveled, bent fingers, atrophied muscles, gnarled knees... will one day have a new body, light, bright, and clothed in righteousness.",
        "He began to call down curses... The magnitude, the immensity of what he has done breaks in on him and he just completely breaks down and weeps.",
        "Stop your blubbering. Suck it up, woman! ... Who will deliver me from this body of death?"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Use of sensory details (the fire, the smell of fish) to ground the biblical narrative.",
        "Relatable humor in the Dick Lucas anecdote that lowers the audience's defenses.",
        "Existential application of the resurrection to physical suffering and injustice."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The emotional weight of Peter's 'cursing Jesus' could be explored with more gravitas to heighten the contrast with grace.",
        "The 'Princess Bride' reference, while relatable, slightly trivializes the emotional stakes of the initial argument.",
        "The direct address ('you have some fires you need to go to') comes very late; earlier emotional engagement with the hearer's own failures would strengthen the resonance."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Pathos is achieved through high-quality illustrations and intellectual empathy rather than raw emotional intensity.",
      "emotional_tone": "Reflective, encouraging, and occasionally humorous, shifting toward a serious call to repentance at the end."
    },
    "ethos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher establishes credibility not through personal boasting, but through 'authority as witness.' By aligning himself with the 'moral failure' of Peter and the 'irritability' of Dick Lucas, the preacher signals that he is subject to the same message of grace. The use of high-level scholarship (Bauckham, Augustine, Luther) establishes intellectual Ethos without appearing arrogant. The preacher’s vulnerability is 'collective'—he speaks of 'our' disordered loves—which fosters a sense of shared journey with the congregation.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s supposed to change you and me.",
        "If you really want to have a life-transforming belief in it, you’re going to have to do the hard work... I actually believe all Christians, especially in the Western world, cannot just say, 'Well, I was raised believing that.'",
        "Unless I admit I’m a moral failure who is completely saved by grace, I won’t have the desire... to listen to people."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Transparent handling of the text's difficulties (e.g., admitting the brevity of the treatment).",
        "Intellectual integrity in citing sources and historical context.",
        "Avoidance of a 'moral superior' tone by emphasizing that the leader (Peter) was the biggest failure."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "More direct personal vulnerability (specific personal failures) would elevate the Ethos from 'teacher' to 'fellow-struggler.'",
        "The reliance on other people's stories (Tada, Lucas, Ramachandra) occasionally masks the preacher's own voice.",
        "The authority is heavily derived from the 'text' and 'scholars'—adding a moment of personal testimony regarding the 'resurrection power' would deepen the impact."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Strong intellectual and spiritual credibility built on humility and submission to the biblical text.",
      "authenticity": "High degree of professional authenticity; the preacher appears as a reliable guide who has personally wrestled with the material."

  "rhetorical_balance_analysis": {
    "dominant_mode": "Logos",
    "suppressed_mode": "Pathos",
    "balance_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a well-balanced example of 'Teaching-Proclamation.' Logos is the driving force, providing a clear intellectual framework that makes the Gospel's 'mechanics' (substitution/justification) understandable. Ethos supports this by ensuring the preacher doesn't sound like a cold academic. Pathos is present and effective but serves the Logos; the stories are chosen to illustrate the points rather than to drive the sermon through pure feeling. The balance is healthy for a teaching-oriented congregation but might feel slightly 'head-heavy' for a more emotive liturgical tradition.",
    "consequences_of_imbalance": [
      "The hearer understands the 'why' and 'how' of the resurrection clearly (Logos), but may not feel the 'shiver' of the supernatural encounter.",
      "Intellectual hearers are highly reached; those seeking a purely affective or mystical experience might find it too analytical.",
      "The risk is that the 'encounter' with the risen Christ remains a well-explained concept rather than a felt reality."
    ],
    "recommendation_for_balance": "Increase the 'heart-pathos' by lingering longer on the silence and shame of Peter at the fire before moving to the theological explanation of 'poimainō'."

    "orthopathy_pathos": {
      "score": 6,

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_rhetorical_score": 7,
    "summary": "This is a rhetorically sophisticated sermon that excels in making complex theological concepts (justification, disordered loves) accessible through clear logical structures and well-chosen illustrations. The preacher successfully navigates the tension between historical evidence and existential application. While the sermon is intellectually rigorous, it maintains a pastoral warmth. The primary strength lies in its ability to deconstruct 'moralism' and replace it with a 'grace-centered' logic that is both rationally and emotionally satisfying. It falls short of an 8 or 9 only because the Pathos remains somewhat secondary to the analytical framework, and the personal vulnerability of the preacher is largely channeled through the stories of others.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Theological clarity regarding the 'Substitution' vs. 'Example' models of Christ.",
      "Effective use of historical-cultural context (shame/honor culture) to prove the authenticity of the text.",
      "Strong narrative arc that connects Peter's failure in Mark to his restoration in John."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Deepen the personal Ethos by sharing a specific personal 'fire' or failure.",
      "Allow for more 'rhetorical space' or silence during the most emotional parts of the narrative.",
      "Consolidate the four points into three to allow for more depth in the 'Evidence' section."
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Rational-Expository with Narrative Illustrations",
    "audience_analysis": "Educated, skeptical, or 'de-churched' individuals who need intellectual permission to believe, alongside long-term believers who struggle with moralism.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more inductive structure where the 'answer' isn't revealed until the end.",
      "Use more direct 'I' statements regarding spiritual struggle to heighten Ethos.",
      "Incorporate a more poetic or sensory-rich description of the 'New Heavens and New Earth' to boost Pathos."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a strong, credible, and logically sound piece of homiletic work. It successfully uses the Aristotelian triangle to move the hearer from the 'head' (believing the reality) to the 'heart' (submitting to the pattern). While it prioritizes Logos, it does so in a way that serves the Gospel's core message of grace, making it a highly effective tool for both instruction and transformation."
