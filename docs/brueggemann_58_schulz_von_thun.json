    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates a high level of exegetical competence, successfully weaving together three distinct lectionary texts. The 'Sache' (the living Christ) is presented as the subverter of social distortions. The factual content is not merely data-driven; it reinterprets the Decalogue not as moralism but as 'markers' against distortion. However, the analysis of the Temple Cleansing is heavily tilted toward a socio-economic critique. While Barthian in its insistence on God's 'otherness,' the sermon occasionally risks reducing the 'Blue' side to a sociological lecture on commodity transactions. The theological depth is found in the transition from Law (Sinai) to the person of Jesus (1 Cor), maintaining a clear intellectual thread that challenges the listener's worldview without becoming overly academic.",

        "The commandments are not simple little moral rules.",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a persona that is deeply concerned with the 'social fabric' and 'pathologies' of modern life. There is an involuntary 'leakage' of intellectual authority and a certain prophetic distance. The 'I' is used sparingly ('I want to think with you', 'I believe'), which suggests a preacher who views themselves as a mediator of the text rather than the subject of the sermon. However, there is a subtle 'Schizoid' tendency (per Riemann) in the sense that the preacher maintains a high-altitude perspective on society, rarely revealing personal struggles with the 'distortion' mentioned. The authenticity is found in the passion for the 'alternative' community, but it remains a largely 'professional' self-revelation.",
      "quotes": [
        "I want to think with you about a distorted society...",
        "I believe that now the church must think afresh...",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching' and 'Paternalistic'. The preacher addresses the congregation as a collective ('the church', 'you') that needs to be 'called out' of the world. There is a clear 'from above' dynamic, where the preacher diagnoses the world's ills and prescribes the 'alternative' life. The 'Yellow' side is somewhat cool; there is little 'depressive' warmth or seeking of harmony. The relationship noise arises from the assumption that the congregation is primarily 'ordinary' and perhaps 'unqualified,' which, while Pauline, can feel patronizing if not balanced with solidary language. The 'We-definition' is that of a counter-cultural minority, which creates a strong 'in-group' feeling but also a high barrier to entry.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward the 'Appeal' (Anspruch). The call to 'live alternatively' and 'subvert the dominant distortion' is a high-pressure demand. However, the preacher attempts to ground this in the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) by identifying with the 'weakness' and 'poverty' of Jesus. The theological 'Gift' is the 'Easter foolishness' that frees one from anxiety. Yet, the 'Red' side dominates: the listener is left with a significant 'to-do' list (go to city hall, be generous, depart the life of distortion). The risk of moralism is mitigated by the fact that the appeal is to 'be' something (weak, foolish) rather than just 'do' things, but the weight of the 'upstream vocation' remains heavy.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a robust, intellectually stimulating sermon that excels in 'Blue' factual depth and 'Red' prophetic appeal. It avoids the trap of 'cheap grace' by presenting the Decalogue as a radical alternative to a 'distorted' society. Theologically, it aligns with Barthian principles by emphasizing the 'holiness' of God and the 'otherness' of the Gospel. However, from a Schulz von Thun perspective, the sermon is somewhat 'top-heavy'. The 'Yellow' relational side is secondary to the 'Blue' content, creating a distance that might lead the 'Relational Ear' to feel judged rather than invited. The 'Green' side is professional but lacks the 'diaconal' vulnerability that would make the call to 'weakness' truly congruent. The transition from the 'Law' of the first half to the 'Gospel' of the second half is well-executed, but the 'Anspruch' (Demand) remains the primary takeaway. It is a 'Satisfactory to Ample' performance that prioritizes the 'Sache' (the Truth) over the 'Beziehung' (the Relationship).",
    "barthian_warning": "Low risk of psychologization. The sermon correctly identifies God as the 'Acting Subject' who is 'beyond our usefulness'.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Profound integration of the Decalogue with the person of Jesus.",
      "Clear, non-moralistic interpretation of 'taking God's name in vain'.",
      "Strong rhetorical structure and use of contrast."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Increase 'Yellow' solidarity to soften the 'from above' prophetic tone.",
      "Infuse more 'Green' vulnerability regarding the preacher's own struggle with distortion.",
      "Ensure the 'Easter Zuspruch' is woven throughout, not just as a coda."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively consistent and theologically serious sermon that challenges the congregation but risks losing them through its intellectual distance and high-pressure appeal."
