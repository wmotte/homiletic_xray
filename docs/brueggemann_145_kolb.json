But we know better. That is why we are like the lame man healed . . . jumping, leaping, and praising God!",

      "analysis": "The sermon is notably thin on concrete, lived experience. It begins with an academic/grammatical hook rather than a situational one. While it mentions 'the valley of the shadow of death' or 'threatening hostility,' these remain biblical abstractions rather than 'slices of life.' There is little attempt to help the hearer feel the weight of the lame man's disability or the visceral fear of the disciples. The connection to the hearer's life world is primarily intellectual.",

While the theological work is high-quality and the logical structure is clear, the sermon remains largely in the realm of ideas. The 'Active Experimentation' phase is present but lacks the specificity required to truly equip the hearer for change. It is a sermon that will satisfy the 'Assimilating' learner but may leave the 'Accommodating' learner feeling detached.",

    "conclusion": "The sermon is a well-crafted theological essay that functions effectively as a teaching tool. From a Kolb perspective, it is 'top-heavy,' excelling in abstract conceptualization but under-serving the concrete and active phases of the learning cycle. The diagnosis is a lack of 'homiletical flesh' on a very strong 'theological skeleton.' To improve, the preacher should focus on moving from the 'grammar of faith' to the 'grit of life,' ensuring that the truth of the pronouns is not just understood intellectually but felt and practiced."
