    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon relies heavily on the imagery provided by the biblical text itself rather than creating new, autonomous metaphors. It effectively 'paints' the biblical scenes of Isaiah 58, particularly the physical acts of justice (bread, clothing, housing). However, the preacher's own language tends toward the abstract-sociological ('economic generosity', 'restorative buoyancy', 'self-preoccupied narcissism'). While the 'Orange Alert' and 'adult bookstore' references provide concrete modern anchors, the sermon often 'tells' the theological meaning of the images rather than letting the images 'show' the reality. It functions well as a rhetorical commentary but lacks the cinematic immersion advocated by Paul Scott Wilson.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and exhibits high 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre). The preacher carefully deconstructs and redefines loaded terms like 'righteousness', 'commandment', and 'adult'. By stripping 'righteousness' of its moralistic baggage and reframing it as 'being truly human', the preacher practices a linguistic surgery that opens the text for a modern audience. The word choice is sophisticated yet accessible, avoiding 'Canaanite' jargon in favor of provocative sociological and psychological descriptors that hit the core of the human condition.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a distinct rhetorical cadence, utilizing the 'prophetic beat' of repetition and contrast. The structure of the sentences often mimics the Hebrew poetry it cites, with balanced clauses and a steady build-up of intensity. There is a clear 'staccato' in the lists of attributes (Section I) that creates a sense of urgency. The transition between the 'traditional/contemporary' worship wars and the 'big surprise' of the text has a rhythmic 'snap' that would be very effective in oral delivery. It avoids 'paper language' by using direct address and conversational interjections.",
      "quotes": [
        "knowing and hoping and resisting, all at the same time",

        "Increase the use of alliteration to make the 'righteous' attributes more memorable."

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high level of linguistic stewardship. It avoids the 'Canaanite' trap by reframing traditional dogmatic terms into the language of 'true humanity'. While it could benefit from more original, sensory imagery (showing rather than telling), its precision and rhythmic cadence make it a strong example of prophetic rhetoric. It treats language as a tool for deconstruction and reconstruction, honoring the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed tradition while maintaining a contemporary edge."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a thematic movement rather than a narrative 'plot' (Lowry). It functions as a gallery of 'sketches' (as the preacher explicitly calls them). While there is a movement from the 'problem' of moralism to the 'solution' of authentic adulthood, the tension is intellectual rather than dramatic. The 'upsetting of the equilibrium' occurs when the preacher challenges the audience's definition of 'adult' and 'righteous', but the structure remains somewhat static—moving from point I to IV like a lecture. There is a 'turning point' in the Isaiah section, but it feels more like a revelation of information than a dramatic shift in the hearer's journey.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have two sketches in our reading...",
        "And then comes the big surprise, right in the middle of the argument",
        "I always wonder about the ads for 'adult movies'..."

        "The introduction of the 'worship wars' creates an immediate point of entry.",
        "The 'big surprise' in Section II provides a necessary rhetorical 'jolt'.",
        "The final section successfully synthesizes the previous points into a call to action."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Create a more cohesive 'plot' where the tension of the 'worship wars' is resolved by the 'fast of justice'.",
        "Avoid labeling sections as 'sketches', which makes the sermon feel like a list.",
        "Build more suspense before the 'big surprise' of the Isaiah text."

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. It perfectly embodies Cilliers' concept of 'reframing'. The preacher takes the ancient 'worship wars' of Israel and maps them onto contemporary congregational life, then reframes the entire debate through the lens of social justice. The 'Orange Alert' and 'adult bookstore' references are not just 'illustrations' but are integrated into the theological argument to show how the biblical text 'looks' at modern reality. It respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the harshness of the 'wicked' gnashing teeth) while making it startlingly relevant.",
      "quotes": [
        "likely arguments between people who wanted it 'traditional' and those who yearned for 'contemporary'",
        "do not participate in the Orange Alert anxiety of the fearful society",

        "Organic connection between the 'fast' of Isaiah and modern economic policy (minimum wage).",
        "The context of 'anxiety' is used to highlight the 'unflappable' nature of the righteous."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition to the Matthew text (Section III) is a bit abrupt compared to the Isaiah integration.",
        "Could explore the 'context' of the 'homeless poor' more specifically in the local setting.",
        "The 1 Corinthians 'mind of Christ' could be more deeply woven into the 'adult' theme."

      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing. It changes the 'frame' from moralism to social solidarity and from 'vice' to 'indifference'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon is an 'open work of art' (Stark) in the sense that it invites the hearer into a process of 'growing'. The preacher uses inclusive, vulnerable language ('I assume you are like me... knowing and hoping and resisting'), which leaves room for the hearer's own struggle. However, the moral imperative is quite strong, which can occasionally feel 'closed' or prescriptive. The ending is liturgically open—pointing toward the 'meal' as a site of ongoing growth rather than a finished conclusion. It acknowledges the 'mystery' of God's purpose, preventing the sermon from becoming a mere political manifesto.",
      "quotes": [
        "I assume you are like me in front of these texts, knowing and hoping and resisting",
        "a meal for the truly human toward which we grow",
        "The question of the truly human refocuses our thought and our action."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The preacher's admission of not knowing the congregation creates a respectful 'space'.",
        "The focus on 'becoming' and 'growing' avoids a 'sealed' moralism.",
        "The use of the 'meal' as an open-ended sign of grace."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'wicked' vs 'righteous' dichotomy could be softened to allow for the 'gray' areas of human experience.",
        "End with a question rather than a definitive statement to increase polyvalence.",
        "Allow more room for the 'resistance' mentioned in Section II to be explored."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Polyvalent. It allows for multiple entry points (liturgical, social, psychological) and treats the hearer as a mature partner."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon's structure is rhetorically powerful, driven by a series of 'reframing' maneuvers that connect ancient texts to modern anxieties. While it lacks a traditional narrative plot, it creates movement through the 'upsetting' of definitions. It successfully avoids being a 'closed' moralistic lecture by grounding the call to justice in the 'mystery' of God and the communal 'meal'. It is a journey of perception (Cilliers) rather than a journey of story (Lowry)."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'cheap grace' and 'happy endings'. Instead of offering immediate comfort, it introduces 'trouble' by challenging the hearer's self-perception. The preacher explicitly rejects 'punctilious moralism' and 'narcissism', which are the breeding grounds for religious kitsch. The emotion is authentic because it is tied to the 'pain of the neighbor' and the 'anxiety of society' rather than manufactured sentiment. It sustains the tension between 'knowing' and 'resisting'.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None found. The sermon actively deconstructs kitsch-prone concepts like 'being good'."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'unflappable' person in an 'Orange Alert' society.",
      "The admission of the preacher's own 'resisting' of the text."

    "recommendation": "Maintain this rigorous intellectual honesty; it is the best defense against the 'kitschification' of the gospel."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by defining it as the 'freedom of God to override petty promoting of self'. By moving the focus from 'requirements' to 'the mystery and purpose of God', the preacher creates a 'space for grace' (Cilliers). However, the strong emphasis on 'responsibility' and 'economic justice' occasionally risks closing that space with a new kind of 'prophetic law'. The 'meal' at the end is the crucial 'opening' where grace is received rather than achieved.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between the 'already' of the call and the 'not yet' of our 'resisting' is sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, righteousness is linked to the 'mystery' of being truly human.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails, but it is a 'costly grace' that looks like justice.",
    "recommendation": "Lean more into the 'unavailable' action of God to ensure the 'responsibility' doesn't become a new burden."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.3,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of prophetic-rhetorical preaching. Its primary strength lies in its 'stewardship of language' and its ability to 'reframe' reality through the lens of Scripture. It avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by refusing to offer easy answers or sentimental comfort. Instead, it invites the hearer into a 'sober beauty' of justice and solidarity. While the imagery is more 'commentary-based' than 'cinematic', and the structure is more 'thematic' than 'narrative', the sheer rhetorical force and linguistic precision create a compelling aesthetic event. It creates a 'space for grace' that is not soft or vague, but sharp and demanding—a hallmark of the Reformed aesthetic tradition where the 'Holy happens' in the hearing of the Word.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Linguistic precision and the reframing of 'Canaanite' jargon.",
      "Authentic, anti-kitsch approach to the 'truly human'.",
      "Effective integration of contemporary cultural anxieties (Orange Alert) with biblical text."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase 'showing' through narrative scenes rather than 'telling' through lists.",
      "Develop a more dynamic narrative plot to replace the 'sketches' structure.",

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Rhetorical (Sober-Reformed)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Kitsch), Marilyn Chandler McEntyre (Stewardship of Language).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'adult' hearers who are weary of moralism and seek an intellectually honest, socially engaged faith.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a 'Lowry Loop' structure to increase dramatic tension.",
      "Incorporate a concrete story of a 'righteous person' to act as a living metaphor.",
      "Use more 'staccato' rhythm in the call to action to mirror the urgency of the prophets."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a high-quality aesthetic performance of the 'Aesthetic Turn'. It treats the sermon not as a container for truths, but as a 'happening' that re-perceives the world. By focusing on the 'beauty of simplicity' and the 'power of metaphor', it honors the Reformed tradition while speaking directly to the 'anxiety' of the modern age. It is a successful 'open work' that invites the hearer to grow into a new kind of adulthood."
