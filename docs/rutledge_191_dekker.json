  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon treats two distinct passages (2 Cor 13 and Psalm 130) as separate reflections rather than a single unified exposition. While it identifies the 'fullness' of the Trinitarian blessing in 2 Cor 13 as unique compared to other Pauline letters, it tends toward general truths about God's love rather than the specific 'nowhere else' quality of the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "The one that we read today is the longest, richest, and fullest of all his valedictory blessings."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus on one pericope. Avoid treating the text as a springboard for general concepts like 'self-giving love' which could be derived from many other passages."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates awareness of the historical context of the Corinthian correspondence and the liturgical history of the Psalm. However, the 'Hebrew and Greek' requirement is not visible; the analysis relies more on English prayer book history and general commentaries.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Corinthian church has gone completely off the rails...",
        "It is called De Profundis, 'out of the depths.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exegetical grounding by showing how the specific Greek or Hebrew phrasing necessitates the theological conclusion, rather than relying on liturgical tradition."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application uses concrete imagery (drug addiction, anorexia, the 'Episcopal prayer book' revisions). It effectively addresses the zeitgeist's resistance to the concept of sin. However, it occasionally slips into 'vague romanticized versions' of human love as a hint of divine love, which Dekker warns against.",
      "quotes": [
        "Maybe he is hooked on drugs and failing in school, maybe she is anorexic...",
        "The removal of this line has robbed us of a powerful buttress to the biblical concept of sin..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond 'human love as a hint' (analogy of attribution) and focus more on the concrete 'lostness' of the modern hearer in relation to the specific Word."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a pattern of 'Illustration -> Context -> Application.' While the transition is smooth, the hearer is often standing 'beside' the text looking at it, rather than being 'expounded' by the text in a single movement.",
      "quotes": [
        "Imagine for a moment...",
        "This is the position in which the apostle Paul finds himself...",
        "Reflect on your own life."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Integrate the application directly into the explanation of the verse so that the 'present of revelation' occurs during the reading of the Word itself."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is a strong point. The sermon explicitly deals with 'misery' (miserable offenders) and 'redemption' (plenteous redemption). It correctly identifies that misery is 'misery before God.'",
      "quotes": [
        "...the depth of which the psalmist is actually speaking here is the depth of the knowledge that he and everyone else is a 'miserable offender.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The 'gratitude' part is somewhat thin, appearing only as a 'joyous and liberating knowledge' at the very end. It needs more development as a life-shaping response."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon takes the possibility of being 'lost' seriously, particularly in the temporal sense (self-destruction). It critiques traditions that remove the language of sin. However, the 'eternal' dimension of the two ways is largely absent.",
      "quotes": [
        "...a child, or young person, who appears to be on the verge of self-destruction.",
        "The idea that we can add up our virtues... is decisively repudiated."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'ultimate possibilities of life design' more sharply. The choice between the narrow and broad way should be more than a psychological realization; it should be a theological crisis."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "While Christ is mentioned as the source of grace and the one who makes love incarnate, the sermon on Psalm 130 remains largely theocentric without a clear Christological telos. The doctrine of the two natures is not utilized to ground the sermon.",
      "quotes": [
        "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ...",
        "the love that has become incarnate in history through Jesus Christ..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make Christ the explicit 'telos' of the Psalm 130 section. Show how 'plenteous redemption' is specifically and only found in the person of the God-man."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The estimated length is approximately 14-15 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for true depth.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the theological exposition. The sermon jumps between two different texts, preventing a deep, sustained 'boring' into a single passage for 20+ minutes."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s standard primarily due to its lack of focus on a single pericope and its insufficient length. It functions more as a thematic reflection on the Trinity and Sin than a rigorous exposition of a specific text. While it handles the 'misery' aspect of the three parts with commendable sobriety, it relies too heavily on liturgical history and human analogies rather than the 'nowhere else' specificity of the biblical Word.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong emphasis on the 'misery' of man before God, resisting modern tendencies to soften the concept of sin.",
      "Effective use of concrete, contemporary imagery to illustrate the gravity of self-destruction.",
      "Clear identification of grace as the only solution to human lostness."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Failure to adhere to the 'one specific passage' rule; the sermon is split between two unrelated texts.",
      "Insufficient length (under 20 minutes) to achieve the necessary 'breadth' for theological depth.",
      "Over-reliance on human love as an analogy for divine love, which risks domesticating the 'wholly other' nature of God's grace."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a series of strong theological reflections, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense. It lacks the specific focus on one pericope and the sustained depth that only comes with greater length and more rigorous exegetical interwovenness."
