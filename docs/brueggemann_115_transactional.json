    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is exceptionally healthy from a TA perspective. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, engaging in reality-testing regarding the failure of modern 'idolatries.' It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent by using inclusive language ('we') and framing the gospel as a gift to be received rather than a burden to be carried. By validating the exhaustion of the 'designated' leaders, it fosters an environment of psychological safety and autonomy.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement with reality.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Designated Hitter' metaphor could be tightened to ensure it doesn't trigger 'Adapted Child' performance anxiety.",
      "The transition from the 'failed truths' of the world to the 'truth of the church' is a sharp turn that requires high Adult processing from the listener."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' to maintain the Adult-Adult contract. Ensure that the 'call to action' remains a 'Free Child' response to grace rather than an 'Adapted Child' response to a new set of rules."
