    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust, operating primarily from the Adult ego state. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent (shaming) or the Rescuer (offering dependency). By using clear analogies and a logical structure, it empowers the listener to engage in self-reflection without coercion. The emphasis on 'Adoption' provides a healthy psychological framework for identity that is not based on performance (Adapted Child), but on status (Adult/Free Child).",

      "Use of the 'Free Child' through aesthetic appreciation of grace."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'diagnostic question' could be perceived as a subtle 'trap' for those who answer 'I'm trying.'",
      "Slightly more 'Free Child' spontaneity could balance the heavy 'Adult' logic."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use self-disclosure (like the car towing story) to keep the Adult ego state grounded in reality and prevent the preacher from becoming a 'Nurturing Parent' who smothers the listener's own discovery process."
