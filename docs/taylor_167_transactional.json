    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful mix of high-energy Free Child inspiration and heavy Critical Parent judgment. While it effectively uses the Adult ego state to handle theological and scientific tensions, it relies on 'Ain't It Awful' dynamics to build a sense of 'in-group' identity. The psychological impact is one of 'inspired shame'—the listener is moved by the beauty of the vision but weighed down by the requirement to not be 'dull' or 'false'.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "High usage of shaming language ('sicken the stomach', 'pitiable').",
      "Tendency to push the congregation into an Adapted Child position of 'dullness' vs 'excitement'."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Reduce the use of 'Ain't It Awful' regarding external groups to build identity. Instead of shaming the 'dullness' of the congregation (Parent->Child), invite them to share in the Adult observation of the 'gallant souls' and 'experts in prayer' as a shared reality."
