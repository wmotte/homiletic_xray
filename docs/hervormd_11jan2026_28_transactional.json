    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically 'warm' but structurally dependent. It relies on the Nurturing Parent ego state to create a sense of safety, but quickly utilizes the Critical Parent to enforce a decision. By placing the congregation in the 'Victim' role of the Drama Triangle (the 'pit'), it risks fostering spiritual dependency rather than Adult-to-Adult faith responsibility.",
