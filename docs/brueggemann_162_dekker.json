    "sermon_start_end": "Parables are intended to interrupt our settled practices. They are addressed to people who have it all settled and figured out who are now invited to think again. This parable is addressed in Luke to the Pharisees. Luke says that they are “lovers of money,” which means that [...] The story makes me wonder what the rich man should have done to make the story work differently. I wonder about that. What do you think the rich man might have done differently?"

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon stays close to the narrative of Luke 16. However, it treats the text primarily as a 'parable of reversal' and a 'tension between Abraham and Moses,' which are somewhat general biblical themes. It misses the radical specificity of what this text alone says—namely the fixed chasm and the sufficiency of Scripture over miracles.",
      "quotes": [
        "The parable is set up to show that our futures are not an easy continuation of the present as we usually assume.",
        "He has appealed to the key tension in the Bible between Abraham and Moses."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more on the unique element of the 'great chasm' and the silence of Lazarus as a specific textual feature, rather than turning it into a general lesson on wealth gaps."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher identifies the Pharisees as 'lovers of money' and mentions the Abrahamic tradition. However, there is no evidence of Greek/Hebrew study or deep engagement with the religious history of Israel beyond a thematic contrast between 'Abraham' and 'Moses'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Luke says that they are 'lovers of money,' which means that they thought they could secure their own future.",
        "He does not spend much time on the poor man, because he addresses the 'lovers of money.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate deeper exegetical insights into the significance of 'Hades' or the specific legal/covenantal implications of 'Moses and the Prophets' in the Second Temple context."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part. It moves from general truths to specific contemporary issues like the wealth gap, tax laws, and racial crises in Charlotte and Tulsa. It avoids vague 'be kind' moralism.",
      "quotes": [
        "So what if this parable were to be addressed to our national economy?",
        "Or we read the story in the midst of our current racial crisis with reference to Charlotte and Tulsa."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application flows more directly from the text's own logic (the impossibility of post-mortem change) rather than just using the text as a mirror for social justice."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a very traditional 'block' structure: I, II, III are exposition; IV, V, VI are application. This separation prevents the 'present of revelation' Dekker seeks. The hearer is an observer before becoming a participant.",
      "quotes": [
        "I. The parable is set up to highlight...",
        "VI. So what if this parable were to be addressed to our national economy?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Integrate the contemporary crisis (Charlotte/Tulsa) directly into the reading of the rich man's torment to create a single movement of 'expounding' the hearer."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is well-articulated as 'being lost in time' (wickedness/ruin). However, redemption is presented more as a 'reversal of fortune' or 'unconditional love' for the poor, which borders on a social gospel rather than a Trinitarian redemption through Christ.",
      "quotes": [
        "The way of the wicked he brings to ruin.",
        "The Abraham tradition is a testimony to God’s unconditional love for Israel and for the world."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Clarify that the 'redemption' of Lazarus is not merely his poverty, but his relationship to the God of Abraham, making the Trinitarian background more explicit."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon takes the 'two ways' seriously, emphasizing that life is not a vacation and that the 'wicked' face ruin. It correctly identifies the possibility of being lost in both time (social ruin) and eternity (the chasm).",
      "quotes": [
        "The way of the wicked he brings to ruin.",
        "In the long run, all the lovers of money will die... the embrace of Father Abraham and the hard commands of Moses still operate."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The ending softens the blow by calling it 'only a parable' and an 'escape hatch.' Dekker would demand the seriousness remain a 'proclamatory word' rather than a 'thought experiment'."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Christ is almost entirely absent as the 'telos'. He is mentioned as a 'close student' of traditions or a storyteller, but not as the Lord who is the goal of the sermon. The doctrine of the two natures is not felt.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus does it by showing how agile he is about the Old Testament traditions.",
        "Jesus knows that the tradition of Moses is really hard-nosed."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must show how Christ is the one who crosses the 'fixed chasm' or how He is the 'one greater than Jonah/Moses' present in the word."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1450 words, the sermon would take about 14-15 minutes at a measured pace. This falls short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum requirement for 'depth'.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical depth (Thesis 2) to reach the necessary breadth for spiritual weight."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon fails primarily on its Christological telos and its formal length. It functions more as a socio-ethical lecture on biblical themes than a 'form of the Word of God.' While the contemporary application to racial and economic injustice is concrete and sharp, the lack of interwoven exposition and the absence of Christ as the living Lord makes it substantively thin according to Dekker's criteria.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application: The mention of specific cities (Charlotte, Tulsa) and economic structures (payday loans) avoids generalities.",
      "Seriousness of the 'Two Ways': It does not shy away from the reality of 'ruin' for the wicked."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length: At 14 minutes, it lacks the 'breadth' required for homiletic depth.",
      "Low Christology: Jesus is treated as a teacher/interpreter rather than the telos and Lord.",
      "Separated structure: The clear division between 'then' and 'now' prevents the actualization of the Word."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This text is an adequate ethical speech, but it is not yet a sermon in the sense of Dekker’s definition. It lacks the necessary duration for depth and, crucially, fails to make Christ the goal of the proclamation."
