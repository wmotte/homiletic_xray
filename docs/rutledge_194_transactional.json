    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. It utilizes a 'Rescue' dynamic that requires the listener to first accept a state of total worthlessness ('no health in us') before offering grace. This creates a dependency loop where the listener's 'Free Child' is suppressed in favor of an 'Adapted Child' who feels 'miserable' to please the 'Critical Parent' (God/Preacher). While theologically traditional, it risks reinforcing shame-based identities.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as capable Adults who can choose virtue, rather than 'self-destructive children.' Balance the 'Critical Parent' view of sin with an 'Adult' view of responsibility and a 'Free Child' view of inherent worth."
