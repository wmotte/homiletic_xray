  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses 1 Corinthians 15 as a thematic anchor but drifts frequently into other biblical texts (Mark, Matthew, John). It fails to identify what is unique to verses 47 and 49 that cannot be found elsewhere. It treats the text as a springboard for a general defense of the 'resurrection of the body' rather than an exposition of the specific 'man of dust/man of heaven' contrast.",
      "quotes": [
        "St. Paul's letter to the church in Corinth addresses this issue head-on.",
        "The first man {Adam} was from the earth... the second man {Christ} is from heaven."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus exclusively on the ontological distinction between the 'man of dust' and the 'man of heaven' as the specific contribution of this pericope, rather than harmonizing it with the four Gospels."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher correctly identifies the Hellenistic context and the Corinthian preference for 'immortality of the soul.' However, the linguistic depth required by Dekker (Greek/Hebrew) is absent, and the exegesis remains at a broad historical-theological level.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Corinthian congregation... were returning to the much more familiar religious idea of the immortality of the soul.",
        "Immortality of the soul was such a commonplace belief in the Hellenistic world..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate a sharper analysis of the Greek terms for 'body' (soma) vs 'soul' (psyche) to ground the exposition in the specific vocabulary of the text."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the sermon's strongest point. It uses concrete contemporary examples (email, the Oklahoma City bombing, Yitzhak Rabin) to illustrate the necessity of bodily presence. It avoids mere 'general truths' by grounding the theology in human grief and physical touch.",
      "quotes": [
        "He acknowledged the power and usefulness of the Net, but observed... there can be no real relationships without face-to-face contact.",
        "the big husky fireman cradling the tiny dead toddler... Bodies matter. Faces matter."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the contemporary 'zeitgeist' of digital disembodiment more directly to the Corinthian 'spiritualizing' heresy to show how modern life repeats ancient errors."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a somewhat traditional structure: an opening anecdote, followed by a block of biblical commentary, ending with application. The 'mixing' Dekker demands is present in the middle, but the sermon still feels like a lecture on a doctrine followed by illustrations.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let us return to Paul's words...",
        "I'm sure that you remember the famous photograph..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid 'returning' to the text after an application; instead, let the contemporary examples be the lens through which the text is read simultaneously."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'misery' of death and the 'redemption' of the resurrection are clear. However, the 'gratitude' (sanctification/ethics) is less developed. The sermon leans toward the objective/Christocentric side, which Dekker warns can overshadow the human subject's response.",
      "quotes": [
        "If Christ has not been raised... you are still in your sins.",
        "our sinfulness exchanged for his righteousness..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Develop the 'gratitude' section by explaining how the hope of the resurrected body changes the way the hearer treats their own body and others' bodies today."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on the possibility of 'perishing,' but it lacks the 'sharpness' Dekker requires regarding the two ways. The ending is largely universalist in tone, focusing on 'all' being made alive without the gravity of the narrow way.",
      "quotes": [
        "If there is no Resurrection, then 'those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.'",
        "all our sins wiped away, all evil done to death forever..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'willing and responsible being' by making the choice between the 'man of dust' and the 'man of heaven' a concrete decision for the hearer."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon emphasizes that resurrection is a 'unique action of God' and not a human possibility. The doctrine of the two natures is implied in the discussion of the 'man from heaven' who is also the 'man from Galilee.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Christ is from another world order altogether.",
        "These things are neither humanly possible nor religiously possible... But... 'All things are possible with God'."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly link the 'man of heaven' to the divinity of Christ to satisfy the dogmatic requirement that the goal of the sermon is God."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 1850 words, the sermon likely clocks in under the 20-minute threshold required for 'depth' (at 100 words/min). It covers much ground but lacks the 'breadth' of sustained exegetical drilling.",
      "improvement_point": "Slow down the pace; spend more time on the specific biblical imagery of the 'seed' and the 'dust' to reach the 20-25 minute mark."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily in its lack of exegetical specificity and its failure to meet the minimum length for depth. It treats 1 Corinthians 15 as a general topic rather than a unique word. However, it succeeds in concrete application and maintains a strong Christocentric focus.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application: The use of the Oklahoma City bombing and digital relationships effectively counters 'spiritualized' theology.",
      "Theological clarity: The distinction between the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body is sharply maintained."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specificity: The sermon harmonizes too many different Bible passages instead of sticking to the 'nowhere else' quality of the selected text.",
      "Insufficient length: At 18 minutes, it lacks the 'breadth' required for true homiletical depth.",
      "Weak 'Two Ways': The seriousness of being lost is mentioned but quickly eclipsed by a celebratory tone that lacks the tension of human responsibility."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate theological speech, but it is not yet a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense. It lacks the exegetical rigor and the specific focus on the 'unique word' of the pericope to qualify as a recreation of the Word of God for today."
