      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively uses the 'courtroom' as a concrete setting. It translates the ancient scene into recognizable visual and social categories (white power, money power, pageantry). However, it lacks a specific, contemporary 'slice of life' story from the hearer's daily experience, relying instead on the biblical narrative's drama to provide the experience.",

      "analysis": "This is a primary strength of the sermon. It pauses significantly at the human condition, exploring the 'why' behind the crowd's behavior and Pilate's confusion.

    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of Visionary and Narrative preaching that effectively utilizes the first half of Kolb's cycle. It fails to provide a complete learning loop due to a lack of concrete application. The preacher succeeds in making the ancient text contemporary by identifying the 'stand-ins' for power (white supremacy, greed, force), which facilitates deep Reflective Observation. The theological framing of Jesus as the 'stand-in' for the God of the Covenant provides a solid conceptual base. However, the sermon remains largely in the realm of 'inspiration' and 'reflection'. The final call to 'decide the verdict' is a powerful rhetorical device but lacks the ethical specificity required for Active Experimentation. It serves the Diverging and Assimilating learners well but leaves the Converging learner without a clear path forward.",

      "Move the 'Active Experimentation' from an internal 'verdict' to an external 'practice'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a high-quality homiletical piece that prioritizes the 'Visionary' and 'Narrative' structures. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'Diverging' sermon that excels in helping hearers feel the weight of the Passion and reflect on the nature of truth and power. Its primary diagnosis is a lack of 'Active Experimentation'. While appropriate for the somber, reflective atmosphere of Good Friday, the sermon would be more 'complete' if the 'verdict' were translated into the 'servant leadership' task of Osmer. It is an effective piece of 'priestly listening' and 'prophetic discernment', but requires more 'servant leadership' to move the congregation from observation to action."
