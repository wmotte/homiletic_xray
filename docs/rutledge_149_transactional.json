    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. It utilizes a 'Fear-Relief' cycle to establish a Parent-Child dynamic. By defining the listener as 'deep in sin' and 'deficient in love,' it activates the Adapted Child's guilt. The 'Grace' offered is a Rescuer's grace—it requires the recipient to remain a 'Victim' (passive, sleeping, or terrified) to be valid. While theologically orthodox in many traditions, the psychological impact reinforces dependency and shame rather than Adult responsibility or Free Child joy.",

      "The depiction of humans as purely passive ('while she is asleep') denies Adult agency."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as Adult partners in God's work. Instead of 'You are deep in sin,' try 'We face real choices in how we use our power.' Move from 'Fear Not' (Parental reassurance) to 'What will you do with this light?' (Adult invitation)."
