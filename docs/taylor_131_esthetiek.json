    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in visual and sensory evocation, particularly through the use of ekphrasis (describing a work of art). By utilizing Holman Hunt’s 'The Light of the World', the preacher creates a mental 'cinema' for the hearer. The imagery of the sea—shifting from a 'highway of light' to 'foaming at the mouth'—is classically rhetorical yet remains fresh. These images are not merely decorative; they serve as the primary vehicle for the theological argument regarding human agency and divine guidance. The preacher follows Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' by painting the 'rude and crude' table of the heart, allowing the hearer to see the poverty of their own offering.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' and rhythmic precision. The preacher avoids dense academic jargon, opting for a vocabulary that is accessible yet dignified. There is a clear 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre) in how the preacher distinguishes between overt and subtle discrimination. The use of triplets ('the Seeker, the Knocker, the Suppliant') shows a high degree of rhetorical care. However, some phrases like 'ten thousand times ten thousand' lean toward homiletical hyperbole which, while effective in performance, lacks the precision of the earlier sections.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a distinct oral cadence, likely reflecting the 'musical' tradition of the Black Church. There is a sophisticated use of parallelism and anaphora ('He needed another's...'). The rhythm shifts from the staccato of the opening ('Not his, yours') to the legato of the sea description. This is clearly 'ear language', not 'paper language'. The repetition of 'What will happen?' creates a rhythmic hook that pulls the listener forward. The preacher understands the sound value of words, using alliteration and rhythmic clusters to emphasize the 'Suppliant' Christ.",
      "quotes": [
        "He needed another's stable... He needed another's boat... He needed another's fish...",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are strong, characterized by a sophisticated blend of visual imagery and rhythmic oral delivery. The preacher uses the Holman Hunt painting not just as an illustration, but as a theological lens. The language is precise when dealing with human experience and evocative when dealing with the divine. It avoids the 'Canaanite' jargon of the pulpit, opting instead for a 'stewardship of words' that respects both the biblical text and the hearer's contemporary reality. The musicality suggests a preacher who 'hears' the text as much as they 'read' it."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry) by starting with a tension: the door is barred and the choice is 'in your hands'. This 'upsetting of the equilibrium' creates immediate stakes. The arc moves from the 'outside' (the knock) to the 'inside' (the supper) and then to the 'outside' again (the world/sea). However, the middle section regarding young people and drugs feels somewhat like a thematic detour that slows the narrative momentum. The turning point—where the guest becomes the host—is theologically brilliant but could be more dramatically highlighted as the pivot of the sermon's energy.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is that the choice for God is completely in your hands. Not his, yours.",
        "I will come in and sup with him and he with me. To him that overcometh...",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a prime example of Cilliers' 'reframing'. The preacher takes a well-worn text (Rev 3:20) and reframes it against the backdrop of late-80s consumerism, racial ambiguity, and the drug crisis. The synthesis is organic: the 'knocking' Christ is not just a Sunday school image but the 'fixed point' for a generation lost on a 'turbulent sea'. The preacher respects the 'strangeness' of the text—that the God who has everything 'needs' our coarse fare—and uses it to challenge the hearer's sense of inadequacy. The context of the 'Black experience' is woven in naturally, providing a concrete 'frame' for the universal need for grace.",
      "quotes": [
        "You are going into a society that is ill. It is not the same kind of overt poison... It is more subtle.",
        "People do not take drugs because of what drugs are. They take drugs because of who they fear themselves to be.",

        "The 'Dallas and Dynasty' references, while effective then, now date the sermon's context significantly.",

        "The connection between 'tithes' and the 'supper' could be more elegantly integrated."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes. It reframes the 'choice' for God not as a burden of will, but as an invitation to adequacy in a world of 'corporate sleaze'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "While the sermon uses the 'open' imagery of the door, the theological framework is somewhat 'closed' by the repeated emphasis that the choice is 'in your hands, not God's'. This creates a high-stakes monovalence that might feel coercive to some hearers. However, the 'supper' imagery creates an 'open work of art' (Stark) by inviting the hearer to imagine their own 'rude and crude' table. The ending is a mix: it offers a 'happy ending' (closed), but the 'sea' metaphor leaves room for the ongoing struggle of the 'not yet'. It leans toward a 'sealed' conclusion where Christ's victory is the final, undisputed word.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is that the choice for God is completely in your hands. Not his, yours.",
        "The door of the human heart opens only from the inside.",

        "The sea imagery acknowledges the 'frowns' and 'turbulence' of life.",
        "The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long) rather than just a judge."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The opening is very 'closed'—it forces a binary choice that lacks the 'ambivalence of existence'.",
        "The conclusion is somewhat triumphalist, which can feel like 'kitsch' if not balanced with the reality of those who feel they are currently 'going under'.",
        "More room could be left for the 'mystery' of why some doors remain barred despite the knocking."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent in its call to decision, but polyvalent in its imagery of the 'supper' and the 'sea'."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are characterized by a strong narrative arc that moves from the individual 'door' to the 'sea' of society. The integration of text and context is the sermon's greatest structural strength, particularly in how it diagnoses the 'illness' of the 1980s. However, the structure is somewhat 'closed' by a heavy emphasis on human will and a triumphalist ending. While the 'supper' metaphor provides an aesthetic opening, the overall dramaturgy is designed to lead to a singular, decisive conclusion rather than leaving the hearer in the 'space of the between'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids religious kitsch by taking the 'pain of suffering' and the 'illness of society' seriously. It does not offer a 'cheap happy ending' initially; it acknowledges the 'foaming' sea and the 'overt poison' of racism. However, it flirts with kitsch in the conclusion with phrases like 'put a spring in your step' and the somewhat repetitive 'victory' language. The 'ten thousand times ten thousand' argument is a form of 'homiletical kitsch'—using overwhelming numbers to bypass the individual's struggle. Yet, the diagnosis of drug use as a search for 'adequacy' is a moment of authentic aesthetic depth that cuts through clichéd moralism.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'spring in your step' and 'courage in your heart' sequence feels like a pre-chewed emotional cliché.",
      "The 'ten thousand times ten thousand' argument as proof of the gospel's efficacy."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'rude and crude' table we set for God.",
      "The honest admission of feeling 'depressed about circumstances' and the 'subtle' nature of modern racism."

    "recommendation": "To increase depth, the preacher could spend more time in the 'trough of the wave' before moving to the 'highway of light', allowing the 'not yet' to have more weight."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon creates 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) by emphasizing that Christ accepts our 'coarse fare' and becomes our guest. This 'reframing' of God as one who 'needs' us is a profound opening for grace. However, the space is partially closed by the opening's radical emphasis on human autonomy ('in your hands... not his'). This 'Arminian' aesthetic can paradoxically close the space for grace by making salvation a human work of 'opening'. The sermon's strength lies in the 'between'—the space between the knock and the supper—where the mystery of the divine-human encounter is most palpable.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained well in the sea metaphor, but resolved perhaps too quickly in the final 'victory' section.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the 'Suppliant God' is respected and beautifully articulated.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the 'supper' imagery, but moralization threatens to take over in the 'drugs and money' section.",
    "recommendation": "Balance the 'choice is in your hands' with the 'grace that enables the choice' to keep the vertical dimension more open."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the African American rhetorical tradition, blending high-literary imagery with urgent social commentary. Its primary aesthetic power lies in its 'optics'—the ability to make the hearer 'see' the knocking Christ and the turbulent sea of life. The preacher avoids the dry, abstract dogmatism of 'Die Aufgabe der Predigt' and instead embraces the 'aesthetic turn' by using sensory language and narrative 'reframing'. While it occasionally falls into homiletical clichés and a somewhat closed, triumphalist structure, the 'sober beauty' of its language and the precision of its psychological insights give it significant aesthetic depth. It is a sermon that 'performs' the gospel as an invitation to a meal, rather than a lecture on a doctrine.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful use of visual art (Hunt's painting) to anchor the sermon's central theme.",
      "Powerful 'reframing' of contemporary social issues (drugs, racism) through a theological lens.",
      "Strong oral rhythm and musicality that drives the narrative forward."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduce the use of homiletical hyperbole and 'victory' clichés in the conclusion.",
      "Better integrate the social commentary to avoid structural 'detours'.",
      "Soften the 'closed' emphasis on human will to allow more space for the 'prevenient' nature of grace."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Poetic-Imagistic with a Narrative-Dramatic structure.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson and the 'Reframing' phenomenology of Johan Cilliers.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to hearers who value narrative, visual metaphors, and a preacher who connects the 'ancient text' to 'modern pain'.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer at the table with Christ.",
      "Use more 'showing' in the social application sections to match the poetic quality of the introduction.",
      "Explore the 'silence' of the knock as much as the 'voice' of the knocker."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Through the lens of homiletic aesthetics, this sermon is a 'strong' (7/10) performance. It succeeds in creating a 'Space for Grace' through vivid imagery and a compelling 'reframing' of the human condition. While it flirts with 'kitsch' in its more triumphalist moments and occasionally 'tells' where it should 'show', its stewardship of language and dramaturgical movement make it a convincing 'open work of art' that invites the hearer into a transformative encounter with the Holy."
