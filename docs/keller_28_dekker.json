Fill your horn with oil and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have chosen one of his sons to be king.” [...] Maybe you look like a supermodel, but that’s going to go away, but if you’re Sarah Smith, you’ll be that forever. Maybe you say, “I wanted to have a family. I don’t have a family. I never married, or this or that went wrong.” If you’re Sarah Smith, you’ll have the true family forever. You’ll have true beauty. Come on! See true beauty with God’s eyes as much as possible. Look at the cross. That will burn your hands so you can look beyond the surface. Let’s pray."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon remains anchored in 1 Samuel 16. It correctly identifies the central tension: human sight versus divine sight. However, it drifts into a general discourse on 'beauty' that could be derived from many other passages (e.g., 1 Peter 3). It fails to fully isolate what is unique to *this* text alone.",
      "quotes": [
        "Literally, what he says is, ‘I see myself a king among Jesse’s sons.’",
        "The heart of the teaching of the text is down here in verses 6 and 7."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more on the specific rejection of Saul and the specific selection of the 'runt' as a unique political-theological act of God, rather than a general lesson on inner beauty."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates adequate knowledge of the original context, referencing the Hebrew nuances of 'seeing' and the cultural weight of primogeniture. The use of Robert Alter provides solid academic grounding.",
      "quotes": [
        "Literally, the Hebrew says, ‘From that moment, the Spirit of the Lord rushed through David.’",
        "What is primogeniture? Primogeniture was the oldest son got all of the money."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the theological significance of the 'horn of oil' and the sacrificial context in Bethlehem to avoid the exegesis feeling like a mere setup for the psychological application."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is sharp and contemporary, specifically targeting the 'zeitgeist' of image-obsession, social media, and pornography. It avoids vague 'be good' platitudes by naming specific cultural idols.",
      "quotes": [
        "Why is Instagram taking over from Facebook? Because I’d rather send a picture than read or even write a text.",
        "Pornography deeply trains you to look at the beauty and the quality of the skin and not the content of the character."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application remains tied to the *text's* specific movement of God's choice, rather than becoming a general cultural critique of technology."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a somewhat traditional 'three-point' structure. While it attempts to weave the two, it often feels like a block of text followed by a block of cultural commentary (e.g., the long section on Neil Postman).",
      "quotes": [
        "I could go on and say that’s the first lesson and let’s go on, but let’s not yet. Here’s the reason why. We need to at least spend a little bit of time recognizing our own cultural moment..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Integrate the cultural critique of 'images' directly into the narrative of Samuel looking at Eliab, rather than pausing the text to discuss media theory."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'misery' of the human condition (inability to be good, obsession with externals) is well-articulated. Redemption is found in the Spirit and Christ. Gratitude is present but less developed as a distinct movement.",
      "quotes": [
        "The real problem is we basically know how we ought to live. We just can’t do it.",
        "David has to get the Holy Spirit if he’s going to become a true king."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'gratitude' (the life of the believer after the 'anointing') more concrete in terms of daily response to grace."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "This is the weakest point. While the sermon mentions being 'lost' or 'devastated' by culture, it lacks the sharp Dekkerian 'two ways'—the ultimate seriousness of life as a journey toward or away from God's destination.",
      "quotes": [
        "The cultural intense emphasis on beauty and appearance has distorted male lives, I think, maybe the most of all."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'temporal loss' of failing to answer God's calling more directly, framing the choice between the 'way of Saul/Eliab' and the 'way of David' as a matter of life and death."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is clearly Christocentric. It moves toward Christ as the 'telos' and links the 'runt' of Bethlehem to the 'marred visage' of the Cross. The doctrine of grace is central.",
      "quotes": [
        "David is pointing us to another child of Bethlehem.",
        "Here’s the one who lost all beauty so you and I could have the only beauty that matters."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the transition from David to Christ is not just an analogy but a theological necessity derived from the text's own failure to find a perfect king in David."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At approximately 34 minutes, the sermon provides the 'breadth' Miskotte and Dekker demand. It allows for historical, cultural, and theological layers to unfold.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "None; the length is adequate for the depth attempted."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of contemporary expository preaching that takes the cultural 'zeitgeist' seriously. It falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily in its structural separation of 'lesson' and 'context' and its lack of the 'two ways' urgency. It leans heavily on psychological/sociological analysis (Postman, Lewis) which, while effective, occasionally pushes the specific biblical text into the background.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong cultural hermeneutic regarding the 'image-driven' society.",
      "Clear Christological focus that avoids moralism.",
      "Adequate use of original languages and scholarly commentary (Alter)."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 'two ways' (the seriousness of being lost) is largely absent or softened into 'distortion' of life.",
      "The structure is somewhat predictable and separates exposition from application.",
      "The specific 'uniqueness' of this passage is occasionally traded for general truths about inner beauty."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition, though it risks 'burdening' the text with too much external cultural philosophy. It is a solid 6.5/10; it performs the 'bicycle mechanic's' job well but could be sharper in its proclamatory 'now' and its demand for a life-defining choice."
