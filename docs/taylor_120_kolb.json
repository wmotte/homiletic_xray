    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is highly effective in grounding abstract biblical concepts in concrete, recognizable human experiences. The preacher uses specific, sensory-rich anecdotes—sitting on a plane with a Texas oilman, the visual of three rows of family at a lonely funeral, and the faces of brickyard workers from sixty years ago. These 'slices of life' create immediate emotional resonance and allow the hearer to identify with the themes of legacy and faithfulness before the theological heavy lifting begins.",
      "quotes": [
        "I sat next to a man on a plane one evening. It later turned out he was an oilman from Texas.",
        "There were three rows of family sitting in the pews and not another soul, except for maybe two or three other people.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher facilitates reflection by pausing to analyze the 'why' behind human behavior and social structures. He critiques the 'momentary dazzle' of political personalities and the fickle nature of worldly popularity. He moves into a deeper cultural critique regarding the 'doctrine of Balaam,' interpreting it as a contemporary issue of 'mixing Christianity and racism.' He asks the hearer to observe the underlying patterns of power and influence, though he sometimes moves quickly to the 'normative' answer.",
      "quotes": [
        "Who here can remember who was Secretary of Transportation during the last two years of the Carter administration? ... Momentary dazzle quickly passes.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The theological exposition is present but often secondary to the narrative and visionary elements. The preacher explains the meaning of 'martyr' and provides historical context for the 'white stone' (tessera). However, the exegesis of the 'doctrine of Balaam' is handled with a 'suffice it to say' approach, skipping the logical/theoretical depth of the Numbers text. The 'big idea'—the distinction between the church and the world—is clear, but the logical connections are more intuitive than systematic.",
      "quotes": [

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon concludes with a powerful call to 'Repent,' but the 'Active Experimentation' is more of a spiritual/internal invitation than a set of concrete action steps.

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of narrative-visionary preaching that prioritizes emotional resonance and cultural critique over systematic exegesis or practical 'how-to' steps. It begins with effective Concrete Experience, using personal anecdotes to explore the theme of lasting influence versus worldly 'dazzle.' It moves into a sharp Reflective Observation regarding the church's potential captivity to political and racial systems. While the Abstract Conceptualization provides clear definitions of 'martyr' and the 'white stone,' it consciously bypasses a detailed study of the Balaam narrative, which may leave the more intellectually-oriented (Assimilating) hearer wanting more depth. The Active Experimentation phase is characterized by a high-intensity call to 'Repent,' but lacks the concrete, ethical handles required for the Converging learner. The sermon's greatest strength lies in its 'Homiletic Window' movement, particularly the transition into a celebratory Visionary conclusion that uses the 'White Stone' metaphor to provide assurance and inspiration.",

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a highly effective piece of visionary rhetoric that succeeds in touching the 'heart' and 'eyes' of the listener. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'Diverging' masterpiece, excelling in creating a recognizable world and reflecting on its flaws. However, it is less balanced as a 'holistic' learning experience; the 'hands' (Active Experimentation) and 'head' (Abstract Conceptualization) are somewhat subordinated to the 'heart' (Concrete Experience). The priority for improvement is to ground the prophetic calls in more specific, biblical logic and to provide the congregation with concrete ethical handles for the 'repentance' the preacher so urgently demands. It remains a strong example of the 'Visionary' homiletical structure, particularly in its ability to use metaphors to awaken spiritual longing."
