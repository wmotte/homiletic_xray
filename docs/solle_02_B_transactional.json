    "summary": "This sermon is a classic example of 'Prophetic' rhetoric that functions psychologically as a Critical Parent attack. While its theological and political concerns are significant, its delivery relies heavily on shaming and the 'NIGYSOB' game. It creates a 'double bind' where the listener cannot celebrate without being 'verlogen' (dishonest). This promotes an Adapted Child response (guilt/compliance) rather than an Adult response (responsible action).",

      "High level of moral coercion.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult invitation for the listener to decide their own response.",
      "Binary 'Yes/No' logic excludes psychological complexity."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try moving from 'You are excluded if...' (Parent) to 'How do we reconcile these two realities?' (Adult). Allow the 'Free Child' of the listener to exist alongside the 'Adult' awareness of suffering, rather than using one to kill the other."
