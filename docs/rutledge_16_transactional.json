  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 7,
    "summary": "The sermon is remarkably healthy for an apocalyptic text. It avoids the typical Critical Parent trap of using 'The End' to shame the congregation. Instead, it uses an Adult-Adult framework to process real-world anxiety (nuclear war). The primary psychological risk is the 'Bait and Switch' where cosmic dread is channeled into institutional stewardship, which can feel like a 'Gimmick' to the listener's 'Child'. However, by acknowledging his own fear, the preacher maintains an authentic connection.",
    "strengths": [
      "Authentic use of the preacher's own 'Child' ego (admitting fear).",
      "Strong Adult engagement with contemporary science and literature.",

    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The pivot to stewardship feels forced and potentially manipulative given the gravity of the nuclear topic.",
      "The 'wicked end of man which we so justly deserve' is a sharp CP injection that contradicts the NP tone of the rest of the sermon."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Separate the stewardship appeal from the nuclear/apocalyptic discourse to avoid the 'Bait and Switch'. Ensure that the 'Free Child' (joy/spontaneity) is given more room so the 'Adult' isn't just processing gloom."
