    "psychological_health_score": 2,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically taxing, utilizing high levels of Critical Parent energy to induce fear and compliance in the listener (Adapted Child). By framing salvation as a 'hidden' and 'difficult' path that few find, it creates a 'Double Bind' where the listener is encouraged to seek but told that seeking is often futile or insincere. This fosters dependency on the preacher’s authority rather than developing the listener’s Adult ego or spiritual autonomy.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try moving from 'You must flee' (CP) to 'Let us examine the reality of our choices' (Adult). Invite the 'Free Child' by highlighting the beauty of virtue rather than just the terror of vice. Reduce the 'Rescuer' role by acknowledging the listener's own capacity to hear God's voice."
