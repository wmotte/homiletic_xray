  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon stays close to John 9, but it treats the passage as a 'symbol' of a general theme (spiritual blindness) rather than mining the text for its unique, non-reproducible content. It misses Dekker's requirement to find what is NOWHERE else in the Bible, instead linking it to general Johannine themes.",
      "quotes": [
        "each of them, John thought, symbolized something about what Jesus Christ came to do",
        "the healing of the man born blind symbolizes Jesus’ ability to deal with our spiritual blindness"

      "improvement_point": "Identify the specific physical and narrative details of the mud and the Pool of Siloam as unique revelatory acts rather than general symbols of 'sight'."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher shows awareness of the historical-religious context (rabbinic theories of sin, Jewish views on worship), but there is no engagement with the original Greek or the specific theological structure of the Gospel of John beyond a surface level.",
      "quotes": [
        "Many of the rabbis actually taught that you could sin in the womb.",
        "It’s astounding that a Jewish man would worship another standing human being."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the linguistic significance of 'Siloam' (Sent) and the legal-religious implications of the Sabbath healing which drives the Pharisaic conflict."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part, using concrete contemporary examples (college applications, seat belts, New York intellectuals). However, it occasionally veers into general psychological truths which Dekker warns against.",
      "quotes": [
        "For example, when an 18-year-old starting to apply to colleges...",
        "There are brilliant people out there. In fact, a lot of them live in New York City."

      "improvement_point": "Ground the application more in the specific 'sent-ness' of the man rather than general 'realization' of facts."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is well-interwoven. It does not follow a 'lecture then moral' structure but moves between the text and the hearer's reality constantly. The hearer is 'expounded' alongside the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "What we’re going to learn from the disciples is something about pain and suffering.",
        "I can actually test you right now. If you do not know what I’m talking about at all..."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "The sermon follows the HC structure perfectly. It deals extensively with the 'misery' of blindness/sin, the 'redemption' of Christ's darkness on the cross, and 'gratitude' as worship.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is called conviction of sin. This means you may have agreed that you were a sinner... but now it comes home.",
        "He has to be torn if we’re going to be mended."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'misery' remains a theological category (before God) and doesn't fully dissolve into 'psychological help'."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon addresses the 'two ways' through the concept of 'blindness without a remedy.' It takes the hearer seriously as a responsible being, though the 'eternal loss' is somewhat softened by psychological language.",
      "quotes": [
        "The only blindness without a remedy is a blindness you’re blind to.",
        "the people who are lost are not necessarily the bad people but the proud people."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon moves toward the cross and the doctrine of the two natures (deity of Christ) as the only solution for the human condition.",
      "quotes": [
        "He sensed the deity, and he worshiped him.",
        "Jesus had perfect spiritual sight... but not on the cross. He was being cut off."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'Light of the World' claim more directly to the specific healing act to avoid a generic 'Christ-on-the-cross' conclusion."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At an estimated 34 minutes, the sermon provides the 'breadth' Miskotte and Dekker demand. It allows for the complexity of the text to unfold.",
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this length but increase the density of specific biblical exegesis over anecdotal illustrations."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of the 3-2-1 rule (misery, redemption, gratitude; two ways; one Lord). However, it falls short of Dekker's 'formal' requirement of strict exposition. It often treats the Bible passage as a symbol for general psychological or theological truths rather than a unique revelation that can be found 'nowhere else.' The exegesis is adequate but lacks the 'Hebrew and Greek' depth Dekker expects from a professional minister.",
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of the 3-part structure (misery, redemption, gratitude) as a background framework.",
      "Strong contemporary application that avoids vague moralism.",
      "Christ is the clear and necessary telos of the message."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The specific text (John 9) is occasionally used as a mere illustration for a pre-conceived theological point.",
      "Lack of technical exegetical depth regarding the original language and historical context.",
      "Tendency to prioritize psychological 'realization' over the 'present of revelation'."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition, though it leans heavily on the substantive 3-2-1 rule while being slightly too 'general' in its formal exposition of the specific pericope."
