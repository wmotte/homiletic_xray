    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes strong, contrasting imagery to distinguish between 'religious kitsch' and the radical reality of the Resurrection. Rutledge employs concrete historical and cultural snapshots—the British Navy toast, the Hindus in the Ganges, and 'Mr. Jefferson'—to ground her critique of generic spirituality. The most striking aesthetic move is the metaphorical 'reframing' of the Middle Eastern conflict. By adopting the political term 'terrorist infrastructure' and relocating it to the 'human heart,' she creates a visceral, sensory connection to the theological concept of Sin. While she avoids overly flowery language, the 'show, don't tell' principle is applied through these cultural vignettes, allowing the hearer to 'see' the difference between a memory and a living presence.",
      "quotes": [
        "The presiding officer raises his glass and says, 'Gentlemen, the immortal memory!'",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Rutledge exhibits high stewardship of language, consistent with McEntyre’s criteria. She is surgically precise in her critique of 'generic spirituality' and 'church-free religion.' Her word choice is economical and deliberate; she avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by defining terms through their opposites (e.g., immortality vs. resurrection). The use of the exact quote from Eagleburger demonstrates a commitment to truth-telling and intellectual honesty. The language is 'loving' in its directness, refusing to offer the hearer the 'cliché' of a sentimental Easter. Every sentence serves the purpose of dismantling the 'skeptical voices' without resorting to straw-man arguments, reflecting a high level of rhetorical care.",
      "quotes": [
        "A 'post-modern priestess, an icon of church-free spirituality.'",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a distinct oral cadence, characterized by a 'staccato' rhythm in the diagnostic sections and a more 'legato' flow in the proclamatory movements. Rutledge uses repetition effectively ('There will always be those...') to build rhetorical momentum toward the conclusion. The sentence length is varied, preventing the 'paper language' feel typical of academic sermons. There is a palpable 'beat' to the prose, particularly in the sections describing the God who 'calls into existence.' The use of the 'Alleluia' at the end feels earned rather than forced, functioning as a rhythmic resolution to the tension established in the opening paragraphs.",
      "quotes": [
        "He can create faith where there is no faith. He can bring peace where there is no peace.",
        "Did anything really happen in the darkness of the tomb that night two thousand years ago? And in the end, does it really matter?",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of this sermon are characterized by a 'sober beauty.' Rutledge avoids the 'kitsch' of flowery religious language, opting instead for a sharp, precise vocabulary that engages with the 2002 cultural zeitgeist. Her imagery is grounded in history and politics, providing a 'reframing' that makes the Resurrection feel like a disruptive event rather than a comfortable myth. The rhythm is disciplined, moving from diagnostic skepticism to robust proclamation with a cadence that demands attention. It is a high-quality example of 'stewardship of language' where form serves the radicality of the content."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a masterful 'Lowry-esque' plot. It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium'—challenging the assumption that Easter is a settled, perhaps boring, holiday. It then moves into the 'complication': the pervasive skepticism of the modern age and the 'terrorist infrastructure' of the heart. The turning point is not a human realization, but the 'unlooked-for thing' of God's action. Rutledge maintains tension by refusing to resolve the Middle East crisis with easy platitudes, instead pointing to a 'transformed future' that is 'beyond imagination.' The movement from the 'immortal memory' of Nelson to the 'living presence' of Christ provides a clear dramaturgical progression from death to life.",
      "quotes": [
        "I wonder how many of you here this morning really believe in the Resurrection.",
        "It goes beyond the imagination of man.",
        "That is what Resurrection looks like when it is lived in the world."

        "Compelling opening that immediately creates a 'problem' for the hearer.",
        "Clear turning point where the focus shifts from human imagination to Divine action.",
        "Strong 'Inter-esse'—the sermon lives in the tension between the 'already' and 'not yet'."

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. Rutledge achieves a profound 'reframing' (Cilliers) by weaving together the biblical text (Romans/Corinthians), the historical context (post-9/11, Middle East violence), and the cultural context (Oprah, Elvis). She does not use the text as a springboard; rather, the text provides the lens through which the 'terrorist infrastructure' of 2002 is reinterpreted. The integration is organic; the 'strangeness' of the Resurrection is maintained as the only viable answer to the 'strangeness' of human evil. It is a 'sober-Reformed' synthesis that respects the distance between 'then' and 'now' while bridging it through the 'event' of the Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "The terrorist infrastructure lies within people’s hearts.",
        "That’s the Corinthians, right there. Church-free spirituality...",
        "Faith in the Resurrection can break down barriers that were unbreakable... the Berlin Wall... apartheid."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of political terminology into a theological framework.",
        "Surprising but natural connections between 1st-century Corinth and 21st-century 'spirituality'.",
        "Honors the 'strangeness' of the text without smoothing it over for modern consumption."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection to the 'Dutch Reformed Church' in South Africa might be a bit niche for some hearers without more context.",
        "Could explore more deeply *why* the 'imagination of man' fails, beyond just quoting Eagleburger.",
        "The link between the Red Sea and the Resurrection could be more vividly 'painted'."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "The sermon offers a radical new frame: the Resurrection is not a 'belief' but a 'disruption' of human impossibility."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "As an 'open work of art' (Stark), the sermon is moderately successful. It avoids the 'closedness' of moralism by emphasizing that the Resurrection is God’s work, not ours. However, the rhetorical style is quite assertive ('I wonder...', 'Now listen to this'), which borders on the 'coercive' at times. While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (the ongoing violence in Israel), it provides a very firm dogmatic answer. There is room for the hearer to 'step in' through the questions asked at the beginning, but the ending is quite 'sealed' with liturgical certainty. It is more of a 'witness' (Long) than a 'conversation,' which is aesthetically consistent but leaves less room for the hearer's resistance.",
      "quotes": [
        "I wonder how many of you here this morning really believe...",
        "It remains to be seen how long this custom will continue.",
        "God will do this. He has promised it."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the reality of doubt and the 'skeptical voices'.",
        "Leaves the 'Middle East' problem open-ended, pointing to a hope beyond human solutions.",
        "Approaches the hearer as an intellectually mature partner."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The tone is occasionally a bit 'instructional' ('Don’t get me wrong...').",
        "Could leave more space for the 'silence' of the tomb before the proclamation.",
        "The ending could be more of an invitation than a declaration."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent and declarative, though it respects the 'mystery' of God's action."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics of the sermon are robust, driven by a clear narrative arc that moves from the 'dead' customs of human memory to the 'living' hope of God's new creation. The integration of the 2002 political context with the Pauline epistles is seamless and provides a powerful 'reframing' of reality. While the structure is somewhat 'closed' by its strong dogmatic assertions, it avoids the kitsch of easy answers by sustaining the tension of the 'terrorist infrastructure' until the very end. It is a well-constructed 'event' that leads the hearer toward a specific eschatological horizon."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is a masterclass in anti-kitsch. Rutledge explicitly identifies and rejects religious kitsch—the 'generic spirituality,' the 'immortal memory,' and the 'happy ending' of 'church-free religion.' She refuses to offer immediate comfort for the Middle East crisis, instead quoting the 'gloomy' analysis of experts. The 'terrorist infrastructure' metaphor is the opposite of kitsch; it is ugly, painful, and real. There is no 'sentiment' here, only 'emotion' born from the collision of human despair and Divine grace. By refusing to 'beautify' the Cross or the Resurrection, she achieves authentic aesthetic depth.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'post-modern priestess' version of spirituality that requires no doctrine.",
      "The 'generic religious belief in life beyond death' that has no 'teeth'."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission that the 'outlook was not good' regarding peace in Israel.",
      "The description of the 'terrorist infrastructure' within the human heart."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of cultural critique; it is the sermon's strongest aesthetic shield against sentimentality."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened precisely through the closure of human possibility. By emphasizing that the Resurrection is 'beyond the imagination of man,' Rutledge creates a 'space' where only God can act. She sustains the tension between the 'already' of Christ's victory and the 'not yet' of the 'terrorist infrastructure.' The mystery of God is respected; the Resurrection is not explained away as a psychological phenomenon but is left as a 'completely new' thing in the world. Grace prevails over moralization because the 'solution' is entirely located in God's 'calling into existence the things that do not exist.'",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained; the sermon does not claim the Middle East is fixed, but that God is 'doing a new thing' in the midst of it.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery is central; the Resurrection is presented as an event that even angels cannot grasp.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the ethical examples (Berlin Wall, Apartheid) are presented as 'what Resurrection looks like,' not as tasks we must achieve to earn it.",
    "recommendation": "To increase space, perhaps allow for a moment of 'lament' for the things that 'do not yet exist' before the final 'Alleluia'."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.7,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high-water mark for 'Sober-Reformed' aesthetics. It avoids the baroque excess of emotionalism and the dry sterility of pure dogmatics, finding a 'middle space' of prophetic witness. The aesthetic power lies in its 'reframing'—taking the raw, ugly materials of 2002 (terrorism, skepticism, Oprah-style spirituality) and placing them within the radical frame of Pauline eschatology. The language is precise, the imagery is culturally resonant, and the dramaturgy is compelling. It is a sermon that 'shows' the power of God by 'showing' the limits of man. While it is rhetorically assertive, it creates 'space for grace' by systematically dismantling human idols and 'immortal memories,' leaving the hearer standing before the 'unlooked-for' act of God. It is an aesthetically 'honest' sermon that treats the Resurrection not as a beautiful myth, but as a disruptive, life-giving reality.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "The 'Reframing' of the 'terrorist infrastructure' as a theological category.",
      "The intellectual precision and 'stewardship of language' in critiquing generic spirituality.",
      "The strong narrative arc that moves from human 'memory' to Divine 'event'."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase the 'openness' by allowing more room for the hearer's struggle within the text.",
      "Refine the 'Elvis' and 'Nelson' transitions to maintain a more consistent aesthetic tone.",
      "Incorporate more sensory 'showing' of the Resurrection's 'new creation' to balance the 'telling' of doctrine."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Prophetic-Reframing",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Thomas Long (The Preacher as Witness).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'modern skeptics' and 'intellectually weary' believers who are tired of religious kitsch and seek a 'gritty' hope.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an even more 'open' ending to allow the 'reframing' to settle in the hearer's mind.",
      "Use more 'painting the picture' of biblical scenes to complement the cultural snapshots.",
      "Maintain the 'anti-kitsch' stance; it is your most powerful rhetorical tool."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Through the lens of homiletic aesthetics, this sermon is a robust and effective 'event.' It succeeds by honoring the 'form' of the Gospel—which is the disruption of death by life—through a 'form' of preaching that is itself disruptive of cultural clichés. It is a model of how to use contemporary 'ugly' imagery to point toward 'divine' beauty without falling into the trap of religious kitsch. A score of 7.7 reflects a sermon that is significantly above average, bordering on excellent, particularly in its synthesis of text and context."
