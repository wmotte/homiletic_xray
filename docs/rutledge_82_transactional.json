        "presence": "High",
        "analysis": "The Nurturing Parent is present through empathy regarding suicide, financial loss, and death, but it avoids being 'smothering' by pointing toward an external Adult reality (God) rather than dependency on the preacher.",

    "risk_explanation": "The only slight risk is the 'Nurturing Parent' becoming too dominant in the conclusion, but it is mitigated by the 'Adult' focus on the character of God."

By acknowledging her own 'mistake' and failure, she refuses the Rescuer role."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exemplary model of psychologically healthy homiletics. It operates almost entirely from an Adult ego state, utilizing reality-testing to challenge 'magical thinking' (e.g., the idea that prayer guarantees safety). By validating the 'Child's' experience of hopelessness and grief without demanding a quick 'Adapted Child' response of forced cheerfulness, the preacher creates a safe space for authentic spiritual reflection. The use of personal failure (the anecdote of the woman who refused to see her) effectively dismantles the Drama Triangle, as the preacher refuses the 'Rescuer' role.",

      "Validation of difficult emotions without judgment."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the 'hopelessness' of the world to the 'hope of God' is intellectually sound, but could occasionally feel like a 'Nurturing Parent' providing a solution too quickly for some in deep trauma."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements regarding failure and maintain the distinction between human desire and reality-based theology to prevent the formation of 'ITHY' games."
