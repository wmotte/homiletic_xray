    "summary": "This sermon is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It avoids the common 'Critical Parent' traps of religious discourse. The preacher maintains an Adult-to-Adult connection by presenting historical facts and social data, then moves into a Nurturing Parent role that validates human suffering without creating dependency. The use of 'we' instead of 'you' prevents a Persecutor/Victim dynamic.",

      "Authentic emotional vulnerability regarding God's empathy."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The prayer at the beginning leans heavily into the 'Victim' role ('weak and needy creatures'), which could be balanced with more 'Free Child' gratitude.",
      "The transition from capital punishment back to the biblical text is slightly abrupt."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'Adult' data to ground theological claims. Maintain the transparency shown when admitting 'I do not know'—this is the ultimate antidote to the 'God-Player' game."
