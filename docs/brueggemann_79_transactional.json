    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of Nurturing Parent homiletics. While it offers profound emotional comfort and addresses real-world issues, it relies heavily on infantilizing the congregation ('orphans', 'chicks', 'children') to establish authority. The transition from the 'comfort' of the Gospel to the 'mandate' of social justice is a psychological 'Bait and Switch'—using the security of the Child to demand the labor of the Adult without fully engaging the listener's own Adult reasoning process.",
    "strengths": [
      "High emotional resonance and use of poetic imagery.",
      "Successfully connects ancient texts to contemporary social anxieties."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'I am the one who gets to remind you' opening is a high-Parent stance that inhibits Adult-Adult dialogue.",
      "The leap from 'nursing child' to 'redistributing resources' is psychologically jarring."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try speaking from the Adult position: 'Let us examine how these texts might change our view of security,' rather than 'I am here to remind you who your parents are.' This invites the listener to process data rather than just react to parental care/demands."
