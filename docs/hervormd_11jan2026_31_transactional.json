    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of using high Free Child energy (vivid storytelling, humor) to mask a Critical Parent agenda. While it offers 'honey' (comfort), it creates a dependency by insisting the listener is incapable of standing before God without the preacher's specific theological solution. It reinforces the 'us vs. them' (Israel vs. Philistines) mentality, which can hinder psychological autonomy and integration with the modern world.",
