    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes strong, cosmic imagery to convey the magnitude of the crucifixion. It avoids mere abstraction by grounding the 'Age to Come' in the physical disruption of the earthquake and the opening of tombs. The preacher successfully 'paints' the scene of the universe being 'wrenched off its axis,' which helps the hearer visualize the theological concept of the apocalyptic turn. However, the imagery occasionally leans into list-making (the list of 'Old Age' items) rather than sustained sensory immersion. The 'show, don't tell' principle is applied effectively when describing the 'triple passive' of God's action, making the invisible hand of God visible through the broken rocks.",
      "quotes": [
        "The universe is wrenched off its axis and sent spinning in another direction.",
        "The earthquake and the splitting rocks signify to us the definitive entrance of God upon the scene.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise, reflecting what McEntyre calls 'stewardship of language.' The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by defining theological terms like 'The Age to Come' through contrast with the 'real world.' There is a clear effort to use words that carry weight, such as 'entropic spiral' and 'unflagging hope.' The distinction between 'futuristic thinking' and 'God's future' is a masterclass in linguistic nuance, preventing the gospel from being subsumed into secular progressivism. The sentence structure is disciplined, with no wasted words, maintaining a high level of clarity throughout.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a rhythmic cadence, particularly in its use of parallelism and repetition. The list of 'Old Age' attributes creates a staccato, overwhelming rhythm that mirrors the frantic nature of the world. This is contrasted with the more 'legato' theological reflections. The use of the T.S. Eliot quote ('In my end is my beginning') provides a poetic anchor that resonates musically. The 'triple passive' section also has a rhythmic quality that emphasizes the divine action. It is clearly written for the ear, with a natural flow that builds toward the 'Good Friday' conclusion.",

        "The rocks were split, the graves were opened, and the bodies of the dead were raised.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' and intellectual rigor. It avoids the fluff of sentimentalism by using precise, almost architectural language to describe the 'invasion' of God's future. The imagery is cosmic and arresting, successfully 'reframing' the crucifixion not just as a historical tragedy but as a metaphysical earthquake. While the modern lists are slightly utilitarian, the overall stewardship of language is high, honoring the 'stewardship of the word' through clarity and rhythmic strength."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'apocalyptic' plot. It begins with the 'upsetting of equilibrium'—the bizarre signs of Matthew 27. It then moves into a deep tension between two worlds (Old Age vs. Age to Come). The 'turning point' is the realization that the resurrection begins at the moment of death, not three days later. This creates a movement from the 'downward spiral' of the hearer's life to the 'upward reversal' of the Cross. The energy is sustained well, though the transition from cosmic theology to personal 'prison doors' feels a bit like a standard homiletical move rather than a surprising narrative twist.",
      "quotes": [
        "What is the meaning of these bizarre events?",
        "The Age to Come is invading the Old with a power that shakes the foundations of the world.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. It exemplifies Cilliers' 'reframing.' It takes a difficult, often ignored text (the raised saints) and uses it to reframe the hearer's entire perception of time and reality. It honors the 'strangeness' of the biblical text—it doesn't explain away the open tombs but lets them stand as a sign of God's invasion. The connection between the 'Old Age' and the 'real world' of taxes and the Internet is organic and sharp. It forces the hearer to see their 'real world' as the one that is actually passing away, which is a profound aesthetic and theological reversal.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is what we call the 'real world.' ... And yet it is this so-called 'real world' which the New Testament describes as 'old'.",
        "Suppose instead of looking at the future by way of the past... we began to judge... the present by the future?",
        "The identifying mark of that Age to Come is the Resurrection of the Dead."

        "The specific political reference (Speaker of the House) might limit the 'reframing' for those on different sides of the political aisle.",
        "Could further integrate the 'saints' specifically—who are they for us today?",
        "The transition to the 'Corinthian' Christians feels a bit like a 'theological lecture' moment."

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is intellectually expansive, it is structurally somewhat 'closed.' It moves toward a very specific, traditional 'Good Friday' conclusion. The 'prison door' questions are meant to open the text to the hearer, but they are answered almost immediately by the 'Jesus has changed everything' proclamation. It functions more as a 'witness' (Long) than an 'open work of art' (Stark). It doesn't leave much room for the 'ambivalence' of the earthquake—it explains exactly what it means. However, the sheer scale of the 'Age to Come' leaves a sense of mystery that prevents it from being completely sealed shut.",
      "quotes": [
        "What is the meaning of these bizarre events? (Opening the question)",
        "Jesus' unconditional love... has changed everything. (Closing the answer)",
        "And that is why this terrible day is called Good."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The initial questions about the 'bizarre events' invite the hearer into the mystery.",
        "The use of T.S. Eliot and the concept of the 'Age to Come' provides a larger-than-life horizon.",
        "The 'prison door' questions allow for personal entry points."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The ending is quite declarative and 'sealed'; it could benefit from an open-ended invitation to sit in the 'darkness' of the tombs.",
        "The 'triple passive' explanation is very didactic, leaving little room for the hearer to interpret the signs themselves.",
        "The sermon 'resolves' the tension of the earthquake a bit too neatly with the 'Good Friday' label."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly closed: It is a powerful 'proclamation' that explains the text's meaning rather than an 'open work' that invites polyvalent interpretation."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon has a robust, apocalyptic dramaturgy. It successfully moves from a 'bizarre' biblical detail to a cosmic reframing of human history. The structure is a 'journey of perception,' leading the hearer from their 'real world' into God's 'Age to Come.' While the conclusion is somewhat traditionally closed and moralistic, the middle section's exploration of time and invasion creates a significant aesthetic space for the 'holy' to happen."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by grounding the 'Good' of Good Friday in the 'terrible' reality of the earthquake and the 'agonized breaths' of Jesus. There is no 'cheap comfort' here; the comfort offered is cosmic and hard-won. It avoids sentimental language about 'Jesus in your heart' and instead uses the language of 'invasion' and 'wrenching.' By taking the 'bizarre' and 'terrible' elements of the text seriously, it achieves authentic aesthetic depth. The emotions evoked are not 'pre-chewed' but are the result of a radical theological shift.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'prison door' list is the closest the sermon comes to kitsch, as it uses somewhat standard 'pastoral' tropes.",
      "None found in the core theological sections."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'universe wrenched off its axis' is a moment of authentic cosmic awe.",
      "The insistence that resurrection begins at the moment of 'last struggle for breath' avoids the kitsch of 'Easter-only' joy."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'apocalyptic' edge; avoid the temptation to list 'everyday' anxieties in the same way every time, as that can become a clichéd 'homiletical move'."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon creates a 'Space for Grace' by emphasizing the 'Triple Passive'—that God is the actor. It removes the burden from the hearer to 'fix' the world and places it on the 'mighty arm' of God. By reframing the 'real world' as 'passing away,' it opens a space where the hearer can breathe outside the 'entropic spiral' of their own failures. The 'mystery' of the open tombs is respected as a sign of a grace that is 'out of the mold altogether.' It sustains the tension between the 'terrible day' and the 'Good' name it bears.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between the 'Old Age' of death and the 'Age to Come' is held until the very last sentence.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, the 'bizarre' nature of the tombs is treated as a divine mystery rather than a puzzle to be solved.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. Even the 'prison' section is framed as what Christ has done to set us free, rather than what we must do to free ourselves.",
    "recommendation": "To increase space even further, the preacher could end with a moment of silence or a less 'neat' summary, letting the 'earthquake' linger in the room."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'Apocalyptic Homiletics.' It avoids the pitfalls of both dry moralism and sentimental kitsch by focusing on the 'reframing' of reality through the Cross. The poetics are characterized by a 'sober beauty'—precise, intellectually demanding, and cosmic in scale. The preacher acts as a 'witness' to a divine event that has already happened, inviting the hearer to see their life through a new lens of time. The 'Space for Grace' is opened by the insistence that God is the primary actor in the 'triple passive' of the crucifixion signs. While the ending follows a more traditional, closed homiletical pattern, the overall impact is one of profound theological and aesthetic 're-centering.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "The cosmic 'reframing' of time and reality.",
      "The 'anti-kitsch' approach to the 'terrible' signs of Good Friday.",

      "The inclusion of specific political figures (Speaker of the House) dates the sermon and disrupts the aesthetic 'world'.",

      "Experiment with a more 'open' ending that leaves the hearer in the 'between' space.",
      "Use more sensory details (smell, sound) to ground the cosmic imagery.",
      "Avoid specific political titles to maintain the 'timeless' quality of the apocalyptic 'Age to Come'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An excellent sermon that demonstrates how 'form is content.' By using the 'bizarre' structure of Matthew's signs, the preacher creates a structure that mirrors the 'invasion' of God into the world. It is a model of how to handle 'difficult' texts without losing aesthetic or theological integrity. It successfully moves the hearer from a 'downward spiral' to a 'reversed direction,' making it a powerful liturgical event for Good Friday."
