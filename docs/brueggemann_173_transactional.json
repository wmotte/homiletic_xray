    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably game-free. By operating primarily from the Adult ego state, the preacher treats the listeners as capable of handling difficult truths about the loss of social power. He uses the Free Child to provide a hopeful, creative vision of 'abundance' that counters the Critical Parent's potential for shame or the Adapted Child's potential for fear. The move from 'scarcity' to 'abundance' is a move toward psychological autonomy.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the sociological 'loss of advantage' to the theological 'forgiveness' could be more Adult-processed to ensure it isn't heard as a Nurturing Parent 'smothering' the real pain of change."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' language to maintain the Adult-Adult level. Ensure that the 'abundance' mentioned is tied to concrete reality so it doesn't become a 'Rescuer' fantasy."
