    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "While the preacher identifies Ephesians 1:12-14, the sermon quickly drifts into generalities about predestination and human responsibility. The 'specific' point of this text—the unique commercial metaphor of the 'earnest' (arrhabōn)—is treated as a springboard for a general talk on witnessing and belief rather than mining what this text says that no other text says.",
      "quotes": [
        "I begin here at the twelfth verse... But particularly these two verses..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus specifically on the 'seal' and 'earnest' as legal/commercial certainties of the Spirit's presence, rather than spending the first half on a general polemic against predestination."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The preacher mentions that the New Testament writers 'seized vocabulary' from the marketplace, which is a correct historical observation. However, there is no actual exegesis of the Greek terms or the specific theological structure of the Ephesian letter. The discussion of predestination is handled via 'neighborhood expressions' rather than biblical-theological study.",
      "quotes": [
        "Theologically, the doctrine of predestination states... That is the doctrine. But do not say that it is something far off..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Engage with the actual Greek terms 'sphragizō' (sealed) and 'arrhabōn' (earnest) to show how the original readers understood these as binding legal guarantees, moving beyond barbershop anecdotes."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application is concrete in its imagery (mink coats, barbershops, traffic signals), but it often falls into 'general truths' which Dekker forbids. The application regarding 'witnessing' is somewhat moralistic and lacks the specific 'now' of the text's promise.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you walk up and down the streets of Brooklyn, talking about everything and everybody except the Lord, you are failing..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'earnest' of the Spirit to specific contemporary anxieties or 'misery' rather than using it as a general exhortation to stop being 'secret service Christians'."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured more as a topical speech using the text as a motif. Exposition and application are not mixed in a way that 'expounds' the hearer; rather, the preacher uses the text to validate his own observations about life and belief.",
      "quotes": [
        "And so I use the phrase 'Down Payment and Will Call.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Allow the text's own logic to dictate the flow. The hearer should feel the text is interpreting their life, rather than the preacher using life to illustrate a text."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is present but 'soft' (infirmity, sadness, 'out of fix'). Redemption is presented as a transaction. Gratitude is framed as a duty of witnessing. The Trinitarian background Dekker demands is present but thin; the Spirit is a 'mark' but the focus remains heavily on human 'responsibility'.",
      "quotes": [
        "if he has fixed us when we were out of fix... if he has lifted us when we were down..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect. Instead of 'out of fix', address the radical lostness that necessitates a 'purchased possession'."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The preacher explicitly rejects the 'seriousness' of the two ways in his critique of predestination, opting for a universalist tone. He suggests 'God willed that all people should be saved' in a way that removes the tension of being lost. This contradicts Dekker's insistence on the possibility of being lost.",
      "quotes": [
        "to say that God has already decreed that some shall go to hell does not gibe with the New Testament..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Reintroduce the gravity of the 'narrow way'. The 'purchased possession' implies a state from which one must be bought; the sermon lacks the urgency of the alternative to redemption."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, particularly in the conclusion. The sermon emphasizes that salvation is outside of man ('he has put the whole thing in our hands' is a momentary lapse into anthropocentrism, but the end focuses on Christ's keeping power).",
      "quotes": [
        "Christ is his life... The pledge, the earnest, the promise of our completion in Christ has been made."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure Christ is not just the 'goal' at the end, but the ground of the entire 'contract' discussed."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "At approximately 21 minutes, the sermon meets the minimum requirement for 'breadth'. It allows for narrative development, though much of that breadth is occupied by anecdotes rather than theological depth.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Trade some of the anecdotal 'breadth' (the long section on breathing and barbershops) for deeper 'expositional breadth'."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s ideal primarily by replacing rigorous exegesis with anecdotal wisdom and by softening the 'two ways' into a general optimism. It functions more as a motivational religious speech than a 'recreation of the Bible into a new, current, proclamatory word.' While it meets the length requirement and maintains a focus on Christ at the end, it relies too heavily on general truths about 'belief' and 'responsibility' rather than the specific, unique claim of the Ephesian text.",
    "strengths": [
      "Adequate length to allow for a movement from human experience to divine promise.",
      "Strong use of contemporary commercial metaphors (Will Call, Down Payment) that align with the text's original 'arrhabōn' imagery.",
      "Clear Christological conclusion that points to salvation outside the self."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Weak exegesis; the preacher bypasses the specific theological weight of the passage for 'neighborhood expressions'.",
      "Rejection of the 'two ways' tension; the sermon lacks the 'seriousness' of the possibility of being lost, which Dekker views as essential for taking God and man seriously.",
      "Over-reliance on generalities; the section on 'we are all believers' is a general truth that could be said without this specific Bible passage."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a borderline sermon. It possesses the formal structure of 'exposition and application' but lacks the substantive 'sharpness' and 'specificity' Dekker demands. It risks being a 'speech about the gospel' rather than a sermon where the specific text says what can be found nowhere else."
