I discovered, however, that one cannot take that moment in the lectionary alone, for the narrative has a much bigger sweep than that. [...] It is a time for refreshing. No wonder the authorities were much annoyed. Ecce homo!",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates experience primarily through the repetition of the 'Ecce Homo' motif and the physical description of the lame man's transformation. It attempts to ground the hearer in the 'bodily' reality of the resurrection. However, it lacks a contemporary 'slice of life' story or a relatable modern situation that would allow the hearer to feel the disability or the healing in their own context before moving to the biblical text.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a significant strength of the sermon. The preacher pauses to analyze the 'why' behind the opposition to the miracle. He explores the human condition through the lens of 'collusion with empire' and 'stagnation.' It moves beyond the surface level of the miracle to ask why the authorities were 'annoyed,' providing a sharp cultural and social critique.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is because the empire has a vested interest in keeping folks disabled, dependent, needy, and intimidated.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon offers a solid theological framework, redefining resurrection not as an 'idea' but as a 'move toward the new future.' It engages in exegesis of the Acts narrative, though it self-admittedly skips over some phrases ('No exegesis offered on that phrase'). It successfully formulates the 'big idea' that the church performs the transformation Jesus initiated.",

While the sermon calls for 'witness' and 'practice,' the applications remain largely categorical (e.g., 'daring political engagement') rather than specific action steps.

It effectively recontextualizes the 'Ecce Homo' motif to challenge the 'Empire of Stagnation.' However, it falls short in the Concrete Experience phase by lacking a relatable contemporary narrative, and in the Active Experimentation phase by failing to provide specific, actionable steps for the congregation. The focus is on 'seeing' and 'understanding' the world differently, which serves the Assimilating and Diverging learners well but leaves the Converging learner without a clear path forward. The theological depth is traceable and consistent, but the transition from the biblical 'man' to the modern 'witness' remains somewhat abstract.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a well-crafted, intellectually stimulating piece that effectively challenges the status quo. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon that prioritizes reflection and conceptualization over concrete experience and application. It succeeds in providing a new 'lens' for the congregation to view their world, which is a vital homiletical task. However, to achieve holistic learning, the preacher must move from the 'what' and 'why' to a more robust 'how.' The priority for improvement is the development of the Pragmatic quadrant to ensure that the 'refreshing' described is not just a theological concept but a lived reality."
