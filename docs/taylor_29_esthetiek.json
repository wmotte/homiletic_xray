    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in 'painting the picture,' a hallmark of Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' philosophy. The preacher reconstructs the biblical world with high-definition sensory details—the 'swaying camels,' the 'blazing bronze doors,' and the 'old wall, stained by years of heat and dust.' This is not merely decorative; it creates a cinematic experience that facilitates what Cilliers calls 'new optics.' The imagery moves from the external (the city's architecture) to the internal (the 'quivering nerve' of the hearer). The metaphors are generally fresh, though some lean toward the traditional. The strength lies in the accumulation of concrete details that make the ancient scene tangible to the modern imagination.",
      "quotes": [
        "caravans with innumerable swaying camels and foot travelers by the hundreds",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is dignified and exhibits 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre), yet it occasionally slips into a romanticized, almost 'Canaanite' liturgical tone. While it avoids dense dogmatic jargon, it employs a specific type of 'pulpit rhetoric'—words like 'forebears,' 'hucksters,' and 'overlordship'—that creates a sacred distance. Precision is high when describing the physical Jerusalem, but becomes more generalized when addressing the 'corruption in high places' or 'meanness gathering around the altar.' The use of 'Mammon' is a classic homiletical shorthand that, while evocative, functions as a semi-jargon term that assumes a specific religious subculture.",
      "quotes": [

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon is clearly written for the ear. It utilizes rhetorical parallelism and alliteration ('grace and guidance,' 'love and leadership') to create a liturgical cadence. There is a conscious variation in sentence length—short, punchy sentences ('He wept!', 'He beheld the city.') are used to punctuate longer, descriptive passages. This creates a 'flow' that Immink would associate with the 'performance' of the holy. The rhythm builds toward the climax of the weeping Christ, though the final transition into the hymn feels somewhat abrupt and breaks the established prose rhythm.",
      "quotes": [
        "God to offer his love and leadership, his grace and guidance to the children of the prophets.",
        "They sang the psalm anthems, but there was no solemn commitment in their hearts. They raised their altars, but no real fires of faith leapt toward the skies.",

    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high degree of micro-aesthetic quality, particularly in its vivid imagery and rhythmic delivery. It successfully 'paints' the biblical scene, allowing the hearer to 'see' the text. While it occasionally relies on traditional pulpit rhetoric and slightly dated alliterations, the stewardship of language is evident. The preacher avoids dry abstraction, opting instead for a sensory-rich narrative that prepares the emotional ground for the sermon's turning point. It is a strong example of the 'New Homiletic' focus on imagery."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear, if somewhat predictable, arc. It begins with 'equilibrium' (the festive atmosphere of Jerusalem), introduces 'tension' (the Roman occupation and the hidden corruption), and reaches a 'turning point' in the weeping of Jesus. However, the movement from the 1st-century Jerusalem to the 20th-century heart is more of a leap than a bridge. The 'plot' is largely descriptive rather than investigative; it tells us what Jesus saw rather than taking the hearer on a journey of discovery. The ending is a call to action that feels more like a liturgical 'exit' than a narrative resolution of the tension established by the weeping Christ.",
      "quotes": [
        "The city was heavy with expectancy. A wistful hope filled the air...",
        "There seems to be a hesitancy and a halt in the procession as he looks at the city...",

        "The transition to the 'now' is very direct ('Now the King draws near to you'), which loses some narrative tension.",
        "The conflict (corruption/hypocrisy) is described but not 'felt' as a struggle within the sermon's own logic.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The integration is functional but lacks the 'reframing' depth Cilliers advocates. The preacher uses the biblical text as a mirror: just as Jerusalem was hypocritical, so are we. This is a 'one-to-one' correspondence that doesn't necessarily offer a 'new frame' for reality, but rather confirms a traditional moral frame. The 'context' remains somewhat vague—'we live by our wits,' 'we live by scheming'—lacking the concrete specificity that made the 'text' section so strong. The synthesis feels 'pasted on' rather than organically grown from a deep intersection of the two worlds.",
      "quotes": [
        "In experience of the holy, we and citizens of old Jerusalem are indeed one.",
        "Underneath our mask of pious goodness the Lord Christ knows that we reject him.",

        "The sermon respects the 'strangeness' of a weeping King."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The application is quite moralistic ('we must', 'we ought'), which can close the space for grace.",
        "The contemporary context is described in generalities (scheming, lust, wits) rather than concrete modern 'images' that match the 'bronze doors' of the text.",
        "The 'reframing' could be deeper: how does a weeping King change our view of power today?"

      "reframing_present": "Minimal; it mostly confirms a traditional 'sin-and-repentance' frame."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "Aesthetically, the sermon is quite 'closed.' It functions as a 'closed work of art' (Stark) by providing the interpretation and the required response ('we ought to fling ourselves recklessly'). There is little room for the hearer's own appropriation or for the 'ambivalence of existence.' The preacher acts as the authoritative interpreter who 'knows' what is under the hearer's 'mask.' While the image of the weeping Christ is inherently polyvalent, the sermon quickly 'seals' it with a call to a 'battle song.' The mystery of the divine tears is subordinated to the moral imperative of the conclusion.",
      "quotes": [
        "Underneath our mask of pious goodness the Lord Christ knows that we reject him.",
        "Ought not this to melt our hearts?",
        "you and I ought to fling ourselves recklessly and magnificently in the path behind him."

      "strengths": [
        "The central image of the weeping Christ is powerful enough to resist some of the sermon's closure.",

        "Reduce the use of 'ought' and 'must' to allow the hearer to respond more freely to the image.",
        "Leave the 'weeping' as a question: why does God weep for *us* specifically? Don't answer too quickly.",
        "The ending is very prescriptive; an open ending or a more reflective prayer might allow for more 'appropriation'."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Closed; the sermon is a monovalent call to commitment."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 5.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is the sermon's weaker dimension. While it possesses a clear narrative arc in the first half, it reverts to a traditional, somewhat coercive 'application' structure in the second. The integration of text and context relies on direct parallels rather than creative reframing. Most significantly, the sermon is 'closed'—it tells the hearer what to feel and how to respond, leaving little room for the 'open work' of the Spirit or the hearer's own interpretive journey. It moves from a 'show' to a 'tell' structure."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon narrowly avoids religious kitsch through its historical gravity and the genuine pathos of the 'weeping' motif. However, it flirts with kitsch in its use of 'magnificent' adjectives ('recklessly and magnificently') and the somewhat 'happy ending' provided by the hymn. The 'pained frown' of Jesus is a borderline kitsch image—it risks being a 'pre-chewed' emotion. Yet, the sermon's insistence on the 'hatred and meanness' and the 'thunder of approaching judgment' provides enough 'trouble' (Wilson) to prevent it from becoming a purely sentimental Palm Sunday story. It sustains the tension of the 'weeping' just long enough to feel authentic.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'pained frown' on a 'calm countenance' feels like a stylized, pious painting rather than a raw human/divine emotion.",
      "The concluding hymn's 'battle song' and 'fields of conquest' offer a triumphant resolution that feels slightly disconnected from the sorrow of the text."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the Roman soldiers drawing 'muttered curses from the clenched teeth' of the Israelites.",
      "The realization that the 'procession stops'—creating a moment of genuine dramatic silence."

    "recommendation": "Avoid 'pious' adjectives like 'magnificent' or 'calm countenance.' Let the raw action of weeping speak for itself without trying to 'beautify' the sorrow."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 5,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is partially opened by the focus on God's 'presentation of himself' and his 'love and leadership.' However, the space is quickly crowded by moralization. The focus shifts from the *event* of God's grace (the weeping King) to the *requirement* of human response ('we ought to'). Cilliers' 'Space for Grace' requires a certain 'unavailability,' but here, the preacher makes God's will very 'available' and prescriptive. The mystery of the incarnation (God weeping) is present, but it is used as a tool for persuasion rather than a space for wonder.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are raised (corruption vs. religion) but resolved perhaps too quickly through the call to 'marching.'",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the divine tears is acknowledged but then immediately interpreted as a 'heartbreak' meant to 'melt our hearts.'",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Moralization prevails in the final third of the sermon.",
    "recommendation": "End with the image of the King passing by, leaving the 'reckless' response to the hearer's own encounter with that grace, rather than demanding it."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically 'good' example of mid-century narrative preaching, characterized by vivid imagery and a strong rhetorical pulse. Its primary strength lies in Domain A: the Poetics of Language. The preacher is a skilled 'painter' who uses sensory details to transport the hearer to Jerusalem. However, the sermon falters in Domain B: the Dramaturgy of Structure. The transition from the beautifully reconstructed biblical past to the moralistic present is too abrupt and prescriptive. It lacks the 'openness' of a work of art, opting instead for a 'closed' rhetorical strategy that seeks to compel a specific emotional and volitional response. While it avoids the worst excesses of religious kitsch, it leans heavily on traditional pulpit tropes that can feel 'pre-packaged.' The 'Space for Grace' is limited by the preacher's desire to secure a 'battle song' response, rather than allowing the mystery of the weeping King to linger in the hearer's conscience.",

      "Focus on 'showing' the modern struggle as vividly as the Roman 'swaggering overlordship'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A rhetorically competent sermon that excels in its 'poetic power' but remains aesthetically conservative in its structure. It successfully 'reframes' the entry into Jerusalem as a moment of divine sorrow, but fails to fully 'refame' the hearer's world, relying instead on traditional moral categories. It is a 'sober-reformed' aesthetic that values the Word but struggles to trust the 'openness' of the aesthetic event."
