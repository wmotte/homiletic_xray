      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's requirement of focusing on ONE specific passage. It treats the Amos text as a thematic springboard and then pivots to Colossians and Luke. It becomes a speech about 'silence and speech' rather than an exposition of what is unique to the Amos pericope.",
      "quotes": [
        "So consider two texts wherein the God of the gospel will not be silent.",
        "The combination of Jesus talk... and neighbor talk... is a dangerous compelling articulation."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher shows awareness of the historical-political tension between Amos (South) and Amaziah (North/Bethel). However, it lacks the depth of Greek/Hebrew nuance Dekker expects from a trained theologian.",
      "quotes": [
        "The high priest, an agent of the king, reported to the king that Amos was a traitor...",

      "quotes": [
        "Our silencing is accomplished by the narcotic of consumer goods...",
        "The silencing of such a tale is because such neighbor talk is dangerous to the high culture of white nationalism."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured in blocks (I, II, III). While the application is sharp, it feels like a second movement rather than being 'mixed' into the exposition as Dekker demands.",

      "findings": "The 'misery' of the status quo and the 'redemption' of the Jesus-reality are present. However, the 'gratitude' (the life of the believer) is framed more as a social duty than a Spirit-awakened response.",

  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short primarily on formal grounds: it lacks a single-text focus and is too short (approx. 15 minutes).

    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an effective prophetic speech, but according to Dekker's strict criteria, it is not yet a 'sermon' because it lacks a singular scriptural anchor and the necessary duration for theological depth."
