    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery effectively by bridging the gap between ancient biblical metaphors and modern cultural artifacts. The preacher employs 'cinematic' references (Hook, Lord of the Rings) to help the hearer 'see' the theological concept of the True King. While the imagery is not always sensory in a tactile or olfactory sense, it is highly visual and narrative. The use of the 'memory trace' and the 'sun shining in full strength' provides a strong mental picture of the divine. However, the imagery remains somewhat intellectualized; it appeals to the 'mind's eye' more than the physical senses, which is a common trait in Reformed aesthetics. The 'show, don't tell' principle is applied through cultural illustrations rather than descriptive prose of the biblical scene itself.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and demonstrates high stewardship. The preacher avoids 'Canaanite' jargon, or when using theological terms like 'covenant' or 'justification' (implied), he defines them through relational categories (neglected vs. abused child). The distinction between 'medicine' and 'food' regarding democracy shows a high level of linguistic care. The vocabulary is accessible yet intellectually rigorous, doing justice to the complexity of postmodern thought without becoming academic. Every word feels intentional, aimed at dismantling secular objections while building a theological case. This precision serves the 'sober beauty' characteristic of the best Reformed preaching, where clarity is the primary aesthetic virtue.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a conversational, oral rhythm that is well-suited for a 'happening' or 'event'. It uses rhetorical figures like parallelism ('will God give up... or will he give in?') and repetition to create a pedagogical cadence. However, the musicality is more rhetorical than poetic. It lacks the 'legato' of contemplative prose, favoring the 'staccato' of logical progression. The rhythm is that of a teacher or a witness in a courtroom—clear, driving, and persuasive—but it rarely reaches the heights of lyrical beauty. It is 'oral language' at its best, but it remains firmly in the realm of prose rather than poetry. The flow is logical, which provides its own kind of aesthetic satisfaction, but it is not 'musical' in a traditional sense.",
      "quotes": [
        "Will God give up on us or will he give in to us?",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of language in this sermon are characterized by clarity, precision, and a sophisticated use of cultural imagery. The preacher acts as a 'steward of language' by translating ancient concepts into a modern idiom without losing theological depth. While the imagery is effective, it is primarily cognitive/visual rather than sensory. The musicality is driven by logical antithesis and rhetorical questions, creating a persuasive oral rhythm. It exemplifies a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic where the beauty lies in the transparency of the argument and the precision of the analogies rather than in baroque ornamentation."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a masterful 'Homiletical Plot' as described by Eugene Lowry. It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' by introducing the 'conundrum' of rejoicing in judgment. This creates immediate tension. The movement follows a clear path: the Promise (longing), the Problem (conflict), and the Provision (resolution). The 'turning point' is the introduction of the Cross, which resolves the tension between love and law. The energy is sustained throughout because the preacher keeps the 'puzzle' alive until the final section. It is not a static three-point sermon but a dynamic journey of 'solving' a fundamental human and biblical problem. The conclusion offers a resolution that feels earned rather than forced.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s one of the key conundrums in the Bible.",
        "I’ve come to judge you. Yay! Huh?",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a prime example of Cilliers' 'reframing'. The preacher takes the ancient text of Psalm 98 and reframes it within the context of modern jury duty, Tolkien, and postmodern philosophy. The synthesis is surprising yet feels natural. The 'strangeness' of the text (joy in judgment) is not smoothed over but used as the very engine of the sermon. The sermon offers a new frame: judgment is not a threat to be feared but a promise to be yearned for, provided it is seen through the lens of the Cross. This is 'reframing' at its most potent—it changes how the hearer perceives both the Bible and their own cultural reality (e.g., the fascination with royalty).",
      "quotes": [
        "How is the Bible like Maggie Smith?",
        "If there is no judgment day, what hope is there for the world?",

      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant use of 'reframing' to turn a 'threat' (judgment) into a 'promise'.",
        "Deep integration of secular thought (Edward Docx) with biblical theology.",
        "The use of the 'Passover' as a 'down payment' on judgment provides a strong historical-theological link."

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Following Ciska Stark's 'open work of art', this sermon is somewhat monovalent. While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (the fear of judgment, the failure of democracy), it moves quite decisively toward a single, closed theological resolution: the substitutionary atonement. The 'conundrum' is neatly solved. While this provides clarity and comfort, it leaves less room for the hearer to 'dwell' in the mystery or the 'not yet'. The ending is an invitation to prayer, but the theological 'schema' is quite coercive—it presents a logical 'must'. However, it respects the hearer as a 'mature conversation partner' by engaging with serious intellectual objections rather than dismissing them.",
      "quotes": [
        "There’s almost no answer... until Jesus Christ shows up.",
        "The answer is 'Yes' to both.",
        "Your judgment day is over."

      "strengths": [
        "Engages the hearer's intellect and doubts seriously.",
        "The 'neglected vs. abused child' analogy allows for different 'entry points' for different hearers.",

        "Leave more room for the 'mystery' of how God judges the 'peoples with equity'.",
        "Allow the 'conundrum' to breathe a bit more before providing the 'answer'.",

      "open_work_diagnosis": "More of a 'closed' work of art due to its strong apologetic/logical resolution, though intellectually respectful."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics of the sermon are exceptionally strong in terms of 'plot' and 'reframing'. The preacher creates a compelling narrative arc that moves from an existential puzzle to a theological resolution. The integration of contemporary culture and biblical text is seamless, providing a new lens through which to view reality. While the structure is somewhat 'closed' due to its strong logical drive and definitive answers, it avoids 'kitsch' by taking the problem of evil and the 'strangeness' of the text seriously. It is a 'dramaturgy of the mind' that leads to a 'space for grace'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully avoids religious kitsch. It does not offer 'immediate comfort' without acknowledging the 'pain of suffering' (referencing the Balkan genocide and the reality of aging and death). It avoids clichéd 'happy endings' by grounding the joy of judgment in the 'terrible judgment' of the Cross. The emotions evoked—longing for a king, fear of a judge—are authentic rather than sentimental. The preacher does not 'beautify' the message with superficial religious language; instead, he uses the 'sober beauty' of a well-constructed argument. The 'Maggie Smith' and 'Tolkien' references could border on kitsch if used sentimentally, but here they serve as rigorous 'memory traces' of a deeper reality.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'Maggie Smith' analogy is on the edge of sentimentality, but is rescued by its theological application.",
      "The 'blossoming buds' image is a bit conventional."

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens a significant 'space for grace' by dismantling the 'moralistic' (conservative) and 'relativist' (liberal) frames that usually close it. By placing the 'judgment' on Christ, the preacher creates a space where the hearer is neither 'neglected' nor 'abused' but 'loved at a cost'. However, the space is somewhat 'dogmatically sealed'—the logic of substitutionary atonement is presented as the only possible resolution. While this is confessionally consistent, aesthetically it limits the 'mystery'. Nevertheless, the 'reframing' of judgment as a 'promise' is a profound act of opening space for grace in a culture that sees judgment only as a threat.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained for the first two-thirds of the sermon but resolved quite rapidly in the final third.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'mystery' of the Cross is explained through the logic of 'law and love', which provides clarity but reduces the 'unfathomable' quality of the divine act.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails over moralization; the 'duty into choice' quote explicitly rejects moralism.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'mystery' of the divine actor (Immink) to be felt more through liturgical pauses or more 'wonder-filled' language."

    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'Apologetic-Narrative' preaching. Its beauty lies not in poetic ornamentation but in the 'sober beauty' of a perfectly integrated structure and the precision of its language. It follows the 'aesthetic turn' by taking the human factor (the 'postmodern' condition) seriously and 'reframing' reality through the lens of the biblical text. The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long) and a 'reframer' (Cilliers), moving between the 'stories' of Tolkien and the 'Story' of the Cross. While it leans toward a 'closed' work of art due to its strong logical drive, it avoids kitsch by sustaining the tension of human suffering and the 'strangeness' of God's judgment. It is a performance of 'intellectual grace' that creates a space for the hearer to see the world—and the Judge—anew.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of judgment from a threat into a promise.",

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Apologetic-Narrative / Sober-Reformed",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing) and Paul Scott Wilson (Four Pages/Imagery), though with a stronger logical/apologetic drive than Cilliers usually advocates.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'urban intellectuals' and 'skeptics' who value logical coherence, cultural literacy, and the dismantling of religious clichés.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'showing' the biblical scene of Psalm 98 more vividly before moving to the cultural analogies.",
      "Use more 'legato' phrasing in the final section to enhance the 'musicality' of the grace being proclaimed.",
      "Leave one 'unresolved' question at the end to increase the 'openness' of the work."

    "conclusion": "The sermon is a high-quality aesthetic event that succeeds in its primary task: making the 'new song' of Psalm 98 audible to a modern, skeptical ear. Its aesthetic power is found in its 'transparency'—the way the form of the argument serves the content of the Gospel. It avoids the pitfalls of kitsch and moralism, opening a 'space for grace' through the rigorous reframing of judgment. While it could benefit from more sensory imagery and poetic 'openness', it remains a model of how 'sober beauty' and intellectual precision can create a profound homiletical event."
