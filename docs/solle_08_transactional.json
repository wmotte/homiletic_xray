While it flirts with 'Critical Parent' moralizing and 'Drama Triangle' dynamics (Rescuing the oppressed), it maintains health through the preacher's self-disclosure of her own 'Adapted Child' struggles. The movement from the 'Critical Parent' (judging the church) to the 'Free Child' (the joy of singing/dreaming) provides a psychologically liberating trajectory for the listener, though it risks creating a new 'Adapted Child' requirement: that one must be an activist to be a 'true' Christian.",
