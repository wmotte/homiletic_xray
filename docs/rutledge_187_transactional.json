While it offers profound comfort (NP), it achieves this by first systematically deconstructing the listener's 'Adult' ego through the 'Critical Parent' insistence on total depravity. The psychological impact is one of 'Relieved Dependency'—the listener feels better, but only by remaining in a Child position relative to the Divine/Preacher Parent.",
