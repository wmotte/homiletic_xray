    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon demonstrates a strong grasp of imagery, particularly in the opening childhood anecdote and the reconstruction of the Samaritan well. The preacher effectively uses 'sensory' triggers—the 'freshly scrubbed hands' and the 'hot and dusty' noon-day sun. Following Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' principle, the preacher doesn't just define 'outcast' but shows the woman 'all alone, with her big water jug balanced on her shoulder.' The imagery of the 'bad neighborhood' provides a contemporary 'reframing' (Cilliers) of ancient geography. However, the imagery becomes slightly more abstract when transitioning into the political examples, moving from sensory details to historical reportage.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and avoids 'Canaanite' jargon. The preacher practices 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre) by carefully defining terms like 'Samaritan' through social analogy rather than dry dictionary definitions. There is a brutal honesty in the language, especially when the preacher includes herself in the critique ('appallingly subhuman wage'). The precision is seen in the numbering of 'demerits' against Jesus, which provides a clear, logical progression. The word choice is economical and hits the core of the human condition without hiding behind pious platitudes.",
      "quotes": [
        "I was living in Richmond in a white neighborhood and going to a white church and paying our housekeeper some appallingly subhuman wage.",
        "He calls for it as though from a great height, signifying to us his human frailty, yes, but at the same time his Messianic authority.",

        "Occasional use of 'as we all know' can be a rhetorical shortcut that assumes too much."

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a conversational, oral rhythm that fits the 'witness' model of Thomas Long. There is a clear use of parallelism and repetition ('Who shall ascend... who shall stand'). The sentence structure is varied, using short, punchy sentences for emphasis ('Uh-oh. There went my fifty percent.'). However, the middle section involving historical obituaries (Virginia Durr) reads more like a lecture or a newspaper article, losing the poetic cadence established in the beginning. It is clearly 'oral language' rather than 'paper language', but it lacks the lyrical heights found in more 'poetic-imagistic' preaching.",
      "quotes": [
        "Judea was good, Galilee was not so good, and Samaria was, as we say, the pits.",
        "Matthew is a jerk. Mary’s clothes are stupid. Jimmy wet his pants.",

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Strong oral language; feels like a direct address rather than a read essay."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by 'sober beauty' and exceptional clarity. It avoids the 'kitsch' of overly flowery religious prose in favor of a direct, honest, and often challenging vocabulary. The preacher uses imagery not as decoration but as a tool for 'reframing' reality, successfully bridging the gap between a 1950s childhood, a 1990s political scandal, and the first-century biblical world. While it lacks high poetic lyricism, its strength lies in its 'stewardship of words'—every sentence serves the purpose of making the 'ungodly' nature of grace palpable."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a sophisticated 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with an 'upsetting of equilibrium' (the realization that clean hands aren't enough). It then moves into a 'complication' by expanding the problem of 'Big Trouble' to the whole human race. The 'turning point' is the introduction of Jesus' radical behavior at the well, which is systematically built up through the 'six demerits.' The energy is sustained by moving from the biblical story to a modern historical 'witness' (Virginia Durr), before concluding with the resolution of the Romans text. It is a dynamic journey from the law (clean hands) to grace (living water).",

        "I quit looking at my hands and started looking into my heart and I knew I was in Big Trouble.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. It performs 'reframing' (Cilliers) by placing the Samaritan woman alongside Rosa Parks and Virginia Durr. It doesn't just explain the 'then'; it makes the 'now' visible through the 'then'. The preacher respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the social taboos of the well) and uses it to expose the 'strangeness' of our own social divisions. The synthesis is organic; the preacher uses the context of 1999 (Lewinsky/Durr) to illuminate the radicality of Romans 5. It avoids the 'springboard' trap by staying deeply rooted in the John 4 narrative while speaking directly to Virginia's social reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "Samaria was not a good neighborhood... Judea was good, Galilee was not so good, and Samaria was, as we say, the pits.",

      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing; reality is viewed through the lens of 'ungodly' grace."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon is an 'open work of art' (Stark) in that it invites the hearer to identify their own 'Samaria' and their own 'unclean hands.' It doesn't offer a simple moralistic 'go and do likewise' but points to a 'happening' of grace. However, the theological conclusion is quite 'sealed'—it is a very strong, declarative Reformed proclamation of 'Christ died for the ungodly.' While this provides comfort, it leaves less room for the 'ambivalence' of the struggle, moving perhaps a bit too quickly to the 'happy ending' of eternal life. Yet, the inclusion of the preacher's own failure keeps the work from being a 'closed' system of moral superiority.",
      "quotes": [
        "I can’t congratulate myself on anything.",
        "Who is a traitor and who is a hero?",
        "He didn’t wait until we had clean hands and a pure heart."

        "The ending is very dogmatically 'resolved', which might close the 'space' for those still feeling the 'trouble'.",
        "The 'missionary' transformation of the woman is presented as a total success, perhaps smoothing over the 'resistance' she might have faced.",
        "Could leave more room for the 'thirst' that remains even after drinking the water."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly open; the preacher acts as a 'witness' rather than a 'judge', though the theology is firmly declarative."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.66,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is high, driven by a clear narrative arc and a masterful integration of text and context. The preacher avoids the static 'three-point' sermon in favor of a 'homiletical plot' that builds tension through social and personal 'trouble' before resolving it in the 'event' of grace. The use of historical 'witnesses' (Durr, sharecroppers) provides a 'reframing' that makes the biblical text urgent and contemporary. While the theological conclusion is firm and declarative, the preacher's own vulnerability ensures the structure remains an 'open' invitation rather than a closed moral lecture."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a powerful antidote to religious kitsch. It explicitly rejects 'cheap comfort' by bringing up the 'appallingly subhuman wages' and the 'pariah' status of the Durrs. It does not offer a 'happy ending' for Virginia Durr (she is still seen as a traitor by many). By including the 'stench' of social reality and the preacher's own 'unclean hands,' it avoids the 'pre-chewed emotions' of kitsch. It sustains the 'pain of suffering' and social conflict rather than smoothing it over with religious platitudes. The emotion is authentic because it is rooted in the 'trouble' of real history.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential kitsch of 'Jesus is the light' is avoided by focusing on the 'demerits' and 'bad neighborhoods'.",
      "The 'happy ending' of the Samaritan woman is tempered by the 'Big Trouble' of the human condition."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The preacher's confession about her own housekeeper and Richmond neighborhood.",
      "The description of the Durrs being 'shunned on the street' and losing their law practice."

    "recommendation": "Continue to lean into the 'strangeness' and 'offense' of the gospel to prevent the grace from becoming 'cheap' or kitschy."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened primarily through the 'reframing' of the ungodly. By defining the 'ungodly' not as 'them' but as 'us' (including the preacher), the sermon creates a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) that is not dependent on human effort ('clean hands'). The tension between 'already' and 'not yet' is sustained in the historical examples. The mystery of why God chooses the 'outcast' is respected. However, the sermon is very 'Christocentric-declarative', which provides a very specific 'frame' for grace, leaving little room for other 'optics' of the Holy.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between social righteousness and the 'ungodly' nature of grace is well-sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of Jesus' 'Messianic authority' in the midst of 'human frailty' is a central theme.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the sermon explicitly deconstructs the 'clean hands' moralism of the preacher's childhood.",
    "recommendation": "To create even more space, the preacher could acknowledge the 'silence' of God in the midst of the 'Big Trouble' before the 'Living Water' appears."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of the 'New Homiletic' with a distinct Reformed-Episcopal flavor. Its primary aesthetic power lies in its 'reframing' of the biblical text through the lens of 20th-century social struggle and personal narrative. The preacher avoids the 'kitsch' of easy religious answers by grounding the 'Living Water' in the 'dusty' reality of Samaria and the 'violent' reality of Alabama. The language is precise, honest, and 'oral', practicing a high level of 'stewardship of the word.' The structure is dynamic, leading the hearer from the 'law' of freshly scrubbed hands to the 'grace' of Christ dying for the ungodly. While it leans toward a declarative theological conclusion, it maintains openness through the preacher's own vulnerability and the use of 'witness' rather than 'teacher' as the primary rhetorical mode.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful integration of biblical text and contemporary social context (Reframing).",
      "Authentic, non-kitschy tone rooted in personal and social honesty.",

      "The transition into historical/political reportage can feel slightly 'lecture-like'.",
      "The ending could allow for more 'ambivalence' regarding the ongoing 'thirst' of the believer.",

    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'lyrical' or 'poetic' language in the theological climax.",
      "Deepen the sensory imagery of the 'Living Water' to match the tactile imagery of the 'clean hands'.",
      "Allow the 'open ending' to linger a bit more before the final 'Amen'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically 'strong' (7.8) sermon that serves as a model for how to bridge the gap between ancient text and modern context without falling into the trap of kitsch or moralism. It demonstrates that the 'beauty' of a sermon lies not in flowery language, but in the 'sober beauty' of the truth about grace. It successfully creates a 'space for grace' by dismantling the hearer's (and the preacher's) pretensions to 'clean hands,' leaving them only with the 'living water' of the unmerited gift."
