  "kolb_phases_analysis": {
    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon attempts to ground the biblical metaphor of 'knocking' in the hearer's life world, particularly through the domestic imagery of rooms (parlor, dining room, bedroom). However, the identification with the 'knocker' remains somewhat abstract until the Father's Day digression, which provides a more visceral, though slightly disconnected, social experience. The emotional connection is primarily built through the preacher's urgency rather than detailed narrative immersion.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Lord stands at your heart's door and mine asking for entrance, and if we have let him in the parlor, he wants to come into the dining room where the food and drink are.",

      "homiletical_manifestations": "Manifests through domestic imagery and a specific cultural appeal to the need for role models."
    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Reflective observation is present but limited. The preacher identifies a 'startling reversal' in how we think about God (seeking vs. being sought), which prompts reflection on the human condition of spiritual passivity or misunderstanding. However, the exploration of 'why' the door remains closed or 'why' we don't believe the knocking is happening is not deeply analyzed; the sermon moves quickly toward proclamation.",
      "quotes": [
        "What a startling reversal this passage is from what we customarily think when we think along these lines.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher connects the Revelation text to the broader biblical canon, specifically the 'I Am' of Exodus. The theological move from the 'hidden God' (Deus absconditus) to the 'knocking God' is logically structured and provides a clear 'big idea': the Knocker is the fulfillment of all biblical revelation. The exegesis of 'Behold' as 'attention' is simple but effective.",

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The application is the weakest phase. While there is a clear call to 'open the door,' the instructions on how to do so remain highly abstract ('trust him'). The sermon offers general promises of blessing and peace but lacks specific, ethical, or practical steps for the 'active experimentation' of this trust in daily life. It leans toward a 'tips and tricks' approach without concrete implementation strategies.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of Christocentric preaching that prioritizes the identity of the divine over human effort. It falls short in the integration of its various parts, particularly the Father's Day digression which, while contextually relevant, disrupts the homiletical flow. The theological work connecting Revelation 3:20 to the 'I Am' of Exodus is the sermon's most effective element, providing a robust Abstract Conceptualization. However, the Reflective Observation phase is bypassed in favor of urgent proclamation, and the Active Experimentation remains in the realm of religious abstraction. The preacher's role shifts between the Poet (Visionary) and the Advocate (Declarative), but the Guide (Pragmatic) role is underdeveloped. The result is a sermon that inspires and informs but fails to provide a clear pathway for practical transformation.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a solid, traditional homiletic effort that succeeds in elevating the hearer's view of Christ but fails to complete a balanced Kolb cycle. Its primary strength lies in its theological depth (Abstract Conceptualization), while its primary weakness is the lack of specific application (Active Experimentation). The preacher effectively challenges the congregation's functional unbelief, but the path toward belief is described in terms too general to facilitate concrete change. For a more holistic learning experience, the preacher should focus on bridging the gap between the 'Great I Am' and the specific ethical and spiritual decisions of the hearer's daily life."
