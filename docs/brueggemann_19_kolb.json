He told a story about those inequities to help his hearers think again [...] The rich man never had a name or an identity. He had only a social role which was temporary and did not last. He is forgotten, unnamed, and abandoned. No name, and no comfort, no future, no water. His future haunts our present.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience primarily through vivid, sensory-rich retelling of the biblical narrative. Brueggemann avoids generic 'slices of life' from the modern world, instead forcing the hearer to 'feel' the biblical scene. The contrast between fine linen and licked sores is visceral. However, it lacks a contemporary 'hook' that places the hearer directly into a modern recognizable situation outside the text itself.",

It succeeds in creating a deep 'Reflective Observation' of the human condition and provides a robust 'Abstract Conceptualization' through the contrast of the Abrahamic and Mosaic traditions. However, by explicitly refusing to offer concrete application, it fails to complete the learning cycle for many adult learners, particularly those with a 'Converging' or 'Pragmatic' style. The preacher's strategy is to 'haunt' rather than 'guide,' which is rhetorically powerful but pedagogically incomplete. The sermon is strong in its 'Visionary' and 'Narrative' structures but weak in its 'Pragmatic' utility.",

      "Ensure the 'Abstract Conceptualization' phase includes a clear 'Big Idea' that bridges to action"
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a high-quality example of 'Reframing Homiletics' that prioritizes the 'Visionary' and 'Narrative' quadrants of the Homiletic Window. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'broken cycle'—it takes the hearer through experience, reflection, and conceptualization but refuses the final step of experimentation. While this is a valid rhetorical choice intended to provoke deep internal change, it risks leaving the congregation without the tools to convert their 'haunting' into 'healing.' The priority for improvement is to find a way to offer practical wisdom without sacrificing the prophetic depth of the message."
