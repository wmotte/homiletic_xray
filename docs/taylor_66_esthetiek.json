    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Thurman utilizes imagery to bridge the gap between abstract theology and human sensation. He avoids the 'dead metaphors' of standard dogmatics by grounding the text in physical reality—the 'grain' of wood, the 'stench' of the tomb, and the 'footfalls' of animals. His imagery of the 'native land' of Jesus provides a poetic frame for the concept of eternity. However, the imagery remains somewhat localized; it doesn't always sustain a cinematic progression throughout the entire text, occasionally retreating into explanation rather than pure 'showing'.",
      "quotes": [
        "His whole way seems to cut against the grain of what we are all about.",
        "There can only be a stench coming from the opened sepulcher.",
        "Mighty animals whose footfalls almost made the forest tremble were not eligible."

        "Effective use of the 'grain' metaphor to describe human resistance to grace.",

        "The imagery of the 'second mile' is explained rather than visualized.",

      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strong 'showing' in the middle section (Lazarus' tomb), but 'telling' dominates the introductory and concluding paragraphs."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is characterized by a deliberate, almost meditative precision. Thurman avoids 'Canaanite jargon', opting for common but weighty words like 'finality', 'earnest', and 'shrewdness'. He wrestles with his own vocabulary in real-time ('I had started to say severe, but that is not the right word'), which creates an aesthetic of honesty. However, some sections become repetitive or use filler phrases ('some kind of', 'to some degree') that slightly dilute the impact of his stewardship of language.",
      "quotes": [
        "Something almost terrifyingly earnest about him that makes us draw back.",
        "That word death does not occur in the dictionary of eternity.",
        "This is the passibility of the Eternal. It is enough to snatch the breath away."

        "Avoidance of clichéd religious terminology in favor of existential descriptors.",
        "Self-correction in word choice demonstrates a high level of linguistic care.",

        "Reduction of verbal fillers like 'one wonders why' or 'it may be'.",
        "The use of 'Kaput! Finis!' feels slightly jarring compared to the otherwise sober tone.",
        "The conclusion leans into more traditional, less precise 'pulpit language' (conquerors, through him that loved us)."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Remarkably low in jargon; theological concepts like 'passibility' are introduced through the experience of tears rather than dogmatic definition."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a rhythmic cadence typical of the African American preaching tradition, even in its more quiet, intellectual forms. There is a clear use of parallelism and staccato phrasing to emphasize the finality of death. The rhythm mimics the movement of thought—starting with a slow, reflective pace and building toward the 'imperious word' of Jesus. The sentence structure is varied, using short, punchy declarations to interrupt longer, flowing reflections.",
      "quotes": [
        "Kaput! Finis! The end! No more! It's over! Lazarus is dead!",
        "Seeing is believing; he says, believing is seeing.",
        "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent use of repetition to build emotional weight ('Finality! Finality!').",
        "Natural oral flow that avoids the 'paper language' of a written essay.",
        "The rhythm of the opening paragraph effectively mirrors the 'attraction and repulsion' it describes."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Some mid-sermon transitions are slightly clunky and break the established rhythm.",
        "The anecdotal section about the New Testament scholar disrupts the poetic flow.",
        "The ending lacks the rhythmic crescendo suggested by the middle section's intensity."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Distinctly oral language; the text breathes and pauses like a spoken performance."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7,
    "summary_language": "The sermon's language is aesthetically strong, characterized by a 'sober beauty' that avoids baroque excess. Thurman's 'stewardship of language' is evident in his careful selection of words to describe the tension of the Christian life. The imagery is grounded and sensory, particularly regarding the reality of the tomb. While it occasionally slips into explanatory filler, the overall musicality and precision create a space where the 'Holy' can be heard through the human voice. It is an example of language that serves the encounter rather than drawing attention to its own cleverness."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' as described by Lowry. It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium'—the tension between attraction and repulsion toward Jesus. It moves into the 'complication' of death and the 'finality' of the tomb. The turning point is not just the miracle, but the 'tears of Jesus' which reframe God's nature. The movement from the 'grain' of human nature to the 'passibility' of God provides a satisfying arc. However, the ending feels somewhat abrupt, moving quickly from the miracle to a generalized exhortation.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus both attracts and repels us.",
        "Lazarus is dead! He says, 'Take me where you've buried him.'",
        "The power of Christ is not finally frustrated by his tears."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong opening that immediately establishes an existential conflict.",
        "Effective build-up of the 'hopelessness' of the four-day-dead Lazarus.",
        "The 'tears' serve as a profound dramaturgical pivot point."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition from the Charing Cross anecdote back to the Lazarus conclusion is a bit sudden.",
        "The 'second mile' illustration at the beginning is slightly too long, delaying the main narrative.",
        "The final 'conquerors' paragraph feels like a standard homiletical 'happy ending' that doesn't fully match the depth of the preceding struggle."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey that moves from human 'shrewdness' to divine 'passibility'."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Thurman excels at 'reframing' (Cilliers). He takes the ancient text of John 11 and integrates it with the modern psyche—the 'Missouri' attitude of 'show me'. He respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the native land of Jesus) while making it relevant to the hearer's internal experience of resistance and grace. The synthesis is organic; the biblical story is not a 'springboard' but a lens through which the hearer's own 'finalities' are viewed. He successfully reframes the miracle not just as a display of power, but as a revelation of a suffering God.",
      "quotes": [
        "We, with our shrewdness and our slickness... assert, 'Seeing is believing.'",
        "That word death does not occur in the dictionary of eternity.",
        "God made us — with the high honor of choice."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant reframing of 'seeing is believing' vs 'believing is seeing'.",
        "Integration of the 'passibility of God' as a response to human hopelessness.",
        "The connection between the 'native land' of Jesus and our 'earth words' is a profound aesthetic synthesis."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could have more explicitly connected the 'Charing Cross' context to the specific 'Bethany' context.",
        "The 'second mile' application at the start feels slightly disconnected from the Lazarus theme.",
        "More concrete contemporary 'finalities' (beyond death) could have strengthened the context."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes; reality is reframed from a closed system of 'finality' to an open space of 'divine capability'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is an 'open work of art' (Stark) in its middle sections, where Thurman leaves room for the mystery of Jesus' tears and the 'passibility' of God. He invites the hearer to 'look squarely at ourselves', acknowledging the ambivalence of the Christian life. However, the conclusion leans toward a 'closed' structure. By ending with a traditional 'conquerors' flourish, he risks resolving the profound tensions he so carefully built up. The mystery of the 'tears' is somewhat flattened by the finality of the 'authority and ability' of God.",
      "quotes": [
        "I think if we will look squarely at ourselves... we will discover... Jesus both attracts and repels us.",
        "This leaves us utterly defenseless.",
        "We shall find ourselves conquerors and 'more than conquerors'."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The introduction of 'repulsion' toward Jesus allows for the hearer's resistance.",
        "The focus on 'Jesus wept' opens a space for the hearer's own grief and mystery.",
        "The concept of 'choice' as a high honor respects the hearer's agency."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The ending is too 'neatly resolved', closing the 'space for grace' created by the tears.",
        "The interpretation of the miracle is somewhat monovalent (God is final).",
        "Could have ended with a question or a lingering image of the 'opened sepulcher' to maintain polyvalence."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily open in its phenomenological approach, but structurally closed in its dogmatic conclusion."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is well-crafted, moving from an existential 'upsetting' to a theological 'reframing'. Thurman avoids the static three-point sermon, opting for a narrative flow that respects the movement of the biblical text. The integration of text and context is the sermon's greatest structural strength, offering a new 'optics' for viewing reality. While the conclusion is slightly too conventional and 'closed', the overall dramaturgy succeeds in taking the hearer on a journey from the 'grain' of human nature to the 'tears' of God."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. Thurman avoids the 'happy ending' cliché for most of the text, dwelling instead in the 'stench' and 'finality' of the tomb. He does not offer 'immediate comfort' but forces the hearer to stand 'defenseless' before the weeping Jesus. The emotion is authentic because it is tied to the 'passibility' of God rather than sentimental platitudes. Only the very final sentence flirts with the 'clichéd story' of victory, but it is grounded in enough preceding 'trouble' to remain largely authentic.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The final flourish of being 'more than conquerors' feels slightly more like a pulpit convention than the rest of the text.",
      "The 'second mile' illustration is a bit of a homiletical trope, though Thurman uses it to illustrate 'grain'."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'stench' and 'decomposition' as 'Finality! Kaput!'",
      "The reflection on God's tears as a result of the 'high honor of choice'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To maintain this high anti-kitsch level, avoid the temptation to end with standard Pauline benedictions that might flatten the unique aesthetic tension of the sermon."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Thurman creates a significant 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) by focusing on the 'between'—the space between attraction and repulsion, between death and life. By emphasizing that God 'can suffer', he opens a space for grace that is not about power, but about presence. The sermon sustains the tension of the 'four days dead' long enough for the grace to feel like a 'reframing' rather than a magic trick. However, the space is slightly constricted at the end by a move toward 'authority' and 'ability' which feels more like a 'dogmatic seal' than an open invitation.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained through the middle of the sermon, particularly the tension of the 'terrifyingly earnest' Jesus.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the 'tears of God' is the aesthetic heart of the sermon and is treated with great respect.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails over moralization; even the 'second mile' is presented as a matter of 'nothing short of grace' rather than mere effort.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'authority' of God at the end to be expressed through the same 'passibility' found in the tears, rather than shifting to a more traditional 'capability' framework."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of the aesthetic turn in homiletics, prioritizing perception and 'reframing' over mere dogmatic instruction. Thurman's primary aesthetic achievement is the creation of a 'sober beauty' that respects the harsh reality of death ('Kaput!') while opening a space for the 'tears of God'. The language is oral, rhythmic, and precise, avoiding the pitfalls of religious kitsch through an honest engagement with human 'repulsion' toward the divine. The sermon functions as an 'open work' for much of its duration, inviting the hearer to stand 'defenseless' at the grave of Lazarus. While the conclusion leans into a more traditional, closed structure that slightly diminishes the 'openness' of the work, the overall synthesis of text and context is masterful. It is a sermon that 'shows' the passibility of the Eternal, reframing the miracle not as a solution to a problem, but as an invitation into the communion of a God who weeps.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Authentic 'reframing' of the Lazarus narrative through the lens of human 'shrewdness' vs divine 'seeing'.",
      "High anti-kitsch quality that takes the 'stench' of death and the 'tears' of God seriously.",
      "Strong oral rhythm and 'stewardship of language' that avoids jargon and paper-language."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The conclusion is structurally 'closed' and uses more conventional language than the rest of the sermon.",
      "The 'second mile' illustration at the beginning is slightly disconnected from the main 'Lazarus' arc.",
      "Occasional use of verbal fillers ('to some degree', 'one wonders') that slightly dilutes the precision."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Poetic-Phenomenological (Sober-Reformed influence in its simplicity and focus on the Word, but modern in its focus on interior experience).",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (reframing, space for grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (imagery, show don't tell).",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who are intellectually 'shrewd' or 'slick' but existentially searching; those who feel the 'attraction and repulsion' of faith.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer in the mystery of the miracle.",
      "Tighten the introductory illustrations to move more quickly into the primary narrative imagery.",
      "Continue to use self-correction and 'searching for the right word' as a tool for authenticity."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically successful sermon that transcends simple moralism. It achieves a '7.2' by being a model of how to handle a well-known biblical text with fresh 'optics'. It avoids the 'kitsch' of easy answers by dwelling in the 'passibility' of God. While the ending is a bit too 'neat', the journey Thurman takes the hearer on is one of genuine aesthetic and spiritual depth, making the 'Holy happen' in the space between the text and the contemporary heart."
