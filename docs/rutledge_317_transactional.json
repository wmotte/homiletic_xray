    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and remarkably free of manipulative 'games'. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, treating the congregation as capable of processing complex theological paradoxes. By moving away from the 'Critical Parent' style of many Good Friday sermons (which often focus on guilt), the preacher allows for an authentic 'Free Child' response of awe and wonder. The use of scholarly nuance (Adult) prevents the sermon from becoming a 'Rescuer' fantasy.",
    "strengths": [
      "High transparency and communicative purity.",

      "The transition to the 'staggering' conclusion could be seen as a slight push into a specific emotional response.",
      "Briefly mentions 'lost sheep' which is a Parent-Child metaphor, though used traditionally here."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' to present data while leaving the 'Free Child' response (awe/joy/sorrow) as an optional, authentic choice for the listener rather than a requirement."
