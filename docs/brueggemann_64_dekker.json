  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon stays close to the narrative of 1 Kings 17. However, it treats the text more as a paradigm for 'power' and 'systems' rather than identifying what is unique to this specific revelation. The focus on the 'energy crisis' as a metaphor risks turning the text into a general social commentary.",
      "quotes": [
        "Drought is an ancient form of energy crisis.",
        "The world enacted by Elijah breaks all such conventions, routines, and stereotypes"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify what this text says about the God of Israel that cannot be found in other miracle stories or prophetic accounts, moving beyond the 'king vs. prophet' trope."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher understands the historical-political tension (Ahab vs. Elijah), but the exegesis is heavily filtered through modern sociological categories. The mention of 'God shema’d' is a superficial nod to the original language without deep theological payoff.",
      "quotes": [
        "God heard (v. 22)! (God shema’d.)",
        "The king could not cause rain, could not give life. The king was impotent"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exegesis of the widow's status in the Ancient Near East and the specific theological challenge Elijah's presence posed to the Ba'al cult, which claimed control over rain."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is largely metaphorical and socio-political ('the king', 'the system'). It lacks the concrete, spiritual specificity Dekker demands regarding the hearer's actual life, focusing instead on a vague 'Lenten agenda'.",
      "quotes": [
        "In various ways, we are all seduced, domesticated, and bought off—economically, religiously, intellectually, politically, morally.",
        "The Lenten agenda for us all is this: Is it possible to do what the king cannot do?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move away from abstract 'systems' and 'kings' to the concrete misery and gratitude of the modern congregant. What does 'eating thin' look like in a 21st-century household?"
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon succeeds in mixing the narrative flow with immediate commentary. The hearer is led through the story and the 'application' is embedded in the retelling, which prevents boredom.",
      "quotes": [
        "The story begins in the failed royal system with this nameless, forlorn widow.",
        "Elijah’s first prayer is an accusation against God (v. 20)."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure that the 'mixing' leads to a 'present of revelation' rather than just a contemporary retelling of an old story."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is present but framed as 'systemic failure' rather than misery before God. Redemption is framed as 'power for life' rather than the specific work of Christ. Gratitude is missing as a response of the Spirit, replaced by 'Lenten effort'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The situation is right for despair and dismay.",
        "Life is promised to the ones who eat thin and pray hard."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Reframe the 'energy crisis' as the theological misery of man's rebellion and the 'new life' as a gift of grace rather than a reward for 'praying hard'."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are present in the choice between the 'king's table' and 'raven's food', but the eternal dimension is absent. The seriousness of being lost is reduced to being 'bought off' by the system.",
      "quotes": [
        "Bought-off people never have power for life.",
        "It is another story about another power, based in another diet."

    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Christ is entirely absent from the text. While it is a Lent sermon, Christ is not the telos. The 'power for life' is linked to Elijah's 'daring' rather than the person of Jesus Christ. This fails Dekker's requirement that Christ cannot be silenced.",
      "quotes": [
        "The news given us in this story is that the power for life is offered. It is carried by a human agent."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly link the 'son restored to life' to the Resurrection of Christ, who is the only true source of the 'power for life' the sermon seeks."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1150 words, the sermon lasts about 11-12 minutes. This is significantly below Dekker's 20-minute minimum. The lack of length correlates with a lack of dogmatic and exegetical depth.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the theological reflection on the nature of God's Word and the necessity of grace to reach the required 'breadth' for 'depth'."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon fails fundamentally on length and Christological focus. It functions more as a socio-political midrash on power structures than a proclamation of the Gospel. While the narrative flow is effective, it substitutes the specific Word of God for a general critique of 'the system'.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective narrative movement that keeps the hearer engaged with the biblical plot.",
      "Strong use of the 'king vs. prophet' tension to create dramatic relevance."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Total absence of Christ as the telos of the sermon.",
      "Insufficient duration to achieve the necessary theological depth.",
      "Application remains in the realm of metaphor ('energy crisis', 'king') rather than concrete spiritual life."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker’s definition. It is a theological speech that lacks the necessary length, Christological center, and specific application to be considered a proper proclamation of the Word."
