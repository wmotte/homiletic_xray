    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in visual storytelling, particularly in the opening anecdote of Bishop Ruiz in a helmet. This image serves as a concrete anchor for the abstract concept of 'spiritual warfare.' Rutledge effectively utilizes the 'New Homiletic' principle of 'show, don't tell' by painting the scene of the Mexican dirt road and the ambush. The use of biblical imagery (the shoot from the stump, the white horse, the armor) is handled with a high degree of sensory awareness. However, some metaphors remain slightly traditional (the 'beachhead'), which, while effective, prevents a higher score for originality. The strength lies in the juxtaposition of the modern helmet with the ancient 'helmet of salvation,' creating a bridge between two worlds through a single object.",
      "quotes": [
        "The bishop is wearing a helmet because he knows that he may be shot.",
        "There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Rutledge demonstrates exceptional stewardship of language. Her word choice is precise and avoids the 'Canaanite' jargon of easy piety. She carefully defines her terms—for instance, clarifying that the 'belt of truth' is not philosophical but personal (Christ). The language is economical; there is little 'fluff.' She handles the nuance of the 'War of the Lamb' with theological precision, ensuring the bellicose language is not misinterpreted as a call to physical violence. The precision in distinguishing between 'human righteousness' and 'Christ’s righteousness' reflects a high degree of theological care that Grözinger would identify as 'form being content.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The belt of truth is not philosophical or scientific truth; it is Jesus Christ.",
        "When Christianity is working as it is supposed to, it is subversive.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a steady, authoritative cadence. It uses rhetorical questions effectively to create a dialogue with the hearer. There is a clear use of parallelism, especially in the concluding sections ('When we are... he puts...'). However, the rhythm is occasionally interrupted by long biblical quotations which, while necessary, break the oral 'flow.' It feels more like a well-crafted essay meant to be read aloud than a spontaneous oral performance. The musicality is 'sober-Reformed'—it doesn't seek to enchant through sound alone but uses rhythm to emphasize the gravity of the struggle.",
      "quotes": [
        "Why is he wearing a helmet? Is it because he is inspecting a construction site? Is he perhaps taking batting practice?",
        "He was proven by him before the walls of Jericho, in the court of Ahab and Jezebel, in Nebuchadnezzar’s fiery furnace.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' and theological precision. Rutledge avoids religious kitsch by grounding her metaphors in harsh realities (bullets, helmets, ambushes). The imagery is the strongest micro-aesthetic element, successfully 'reframing' the concept of spiritual warfare from a cliché into a lived, dangerous reality. While the rhythm is occasionally hampered by the density of the scriptural proofs, the overall stewardship of language is high, reflecting a deep respect for the Word as both content and instrument."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' as described by Lowry. It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium'—the image of a bishop in a helmet—which immediately raises the 'why?' question. It moves from the 'trouble' (the reality of the Enemy and persecution) to the 'grace' (the armor provided by God). The turning point is the paradox of the 'War of the Lamb,' where the nature of the weapons is revealed to be non-violent. The movement from the cosmic struggle to the personal 'battle stations' of the congregation provides a satisfying descent from the abstract to the concrete.",
      "quotes": [
        "No, the bishop is wearing a helmet because he knows that he may be shot.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The middle section feels a bit like a 'string of pearls' (verse after verse) which stalls the narrative drive.",
        "The connection to Flight 93 feels slightly tacked on to the end of a theological point.",
        "The conclusion is a bit of a 'litany' of applications that could be more narratively integrated."

      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey that moves from a specific image to a cosmic reality, then back to the hearer's life."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a masterclass in 'reframing' (Cilliers). Rutledge takes the 'bellicose' and often problematic imagery of holy war and reframes it through the lens of the Cross. She connects the 1st-century Roman persecution, the 21st-century Mexican struggle, and the post-9/11 American anxiety into a single theological framework. The integration is organic because she doesn't use the text as a springboard; she allows the text's own 'strangeness' (the Lamb with a sword in his mouth) to speak to the 'strangeness' of a bishop in a helmet. She respects the 'already/not yet' tension perfectly.",
      "quotes": [
        "That is the message that the Bible teachers were teaching down in Mexico when they got shot.",
        "We are all talking about good and evil in America these days. The New Testament talks about it too, but in a very particular way.",
        "The armor that God has given you... is God’s own armor."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent 'reframing' of war imagery into a theology of the Cross.",
        "Honors the 'strangeness' of the biblical text without domesticating it.",
        "Contemporary references (Mexico, Flight 93) feel urgent, not merely illustrative."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The mention of 'Jesus freaks' and 'talk show hosts' feels a bit like a 'culture war' aside.",
        "Could explore the 'context' of the congregation's specific 'battlegrounds' with more detail.",
        "The transition from the Isaiah 'wolf and lamb' to the Mexican bishop could be smoother."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes, it successfully reframes the cultural 'war on terror' into the 'War of the Lamb'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is theologically 'closed' in its conviction of Christ's victory, it remains an 'open work of art' (Stark) in how it invites the hearer to find their own 'battle station.' It doesn't offer easy, moralistic checklists. Instead, it leaves the hearer with the weight of the struggle and the promise of the armor. However, the ending is somewhat declarative and 'sealed' with a series of 'He will...' statements. It lacks the 'open question' that might stimulate further individual interpretation, leaning more toward the 'Preacher as Witness' (Long) model which is authoritative.",
      "quotes": [
        "I wonder what you are confronting in your life.",
        "Each one of you is placed on the battleground somewhere.",
        "In spite of all appearances, they have already lost."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The 'I wonder' section creates space for the hearer's own life.",
        "Acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (pain, doubt, sorrow).",
        "The sermon doesn't resolve the 'war'—it only identifies the armor."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The final 'Amen! Come, Lord Jesus' is a bit of a liturgical 'full stop' that closes the conversation.",
        "Could leave more room for the 'resistance' a hearer might feel toward 'war' imagery.",
        "The theological conclusions are very firm, leaving little room for 'polyvalence'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Moderately open; the application is personal, but the theological framework is strictly monovalent."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are strong, characterized by a clear dramaturgical movement from the 'upsetting' image of the helmet to the cosmic 'War of the Lamb' and finally to the personal 'battle station.' Rutledge avoids the static three-point structure in favor of a narrative journey. The integration of text and context is the highlight, providing a sophisticated 'reframing' of contemporary violence through the non-violent victory of the Cross. While the conclusion is somewhat dogmatically 'closed,' the sermon successfully creates a space for the hearer to inhabit the tension of the 'already/not yet'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. Rutledge explicitly avoids 'cheap comfort' by emphasizing that the 'War of the Lamb' involves blood—specifically the blood of the Lamb and his followers. She does not offer a 'happy ending' in the worldly sense; the bishop is still in danger, and the aid workers were ridiculed. The emotions evoked are authentic (fear, struggle, weakness) rather than sentimental. By using the 'helmet' and 'bullets,' she prevents the 'armor of God' from becoming a cute Sunday School felt-board illustration. This is 'sober beauty' at its best.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None identified; the sermon actively deconstructs kitsch versions of 'spiritual warfare'.",
      "The potential for kitsch in the Flight 93 reference is avoided by keeping it brief and focused on a prayer of weakness."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'stench' of real battle vs. the 'strange weapons' of the Spirit.",
      "The acknowledgment of 'secret temptation or sin' and 'burdens of sorrow' as real battlegrounds."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Continue to ground high theological concepts in 'gritty' contemporary realities to maintain this high anti-kitsch threshold."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened through the insistence that the armor is 'God's own' and 'in no sense your own achievement.' This is a classic Cilliers 'Space for Grace' move: it removes the burden of performance from the hearer. By emphasizing that it is 'Christ's righteousness' and 'Christ's faith,' Rutledge creates a clearing where the 'weak' hearer can stand. The sermon sustains the tension between the 'malign forces' and the 'victory already won,' refusing to resolve it through human effort or moralism.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between the 'hostile power' and the 'victory' is held until the very last line.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'paradox' of the Lamb's war respects the mystery of divine action.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the 'putting on' of Christ is presented as a gift/clothing rather than a work.",
    "recommendation": "To open even more space, the preacher could acknowledge the moments when the armor feels 'absent' or 'heavy' for the believer."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'Theological Realism' combined with 'The New Homiletic.' Its primary aesthetic strength lies in its 'reframing' of the armor of God—a passage often relegated to kitschy children's lessons—into a high-stakes, contemporary drama of cosmic proportions. The 'micro-aesthetics' of the language are precise and evocative, particularly in the opening narrative. The 'macro-aesthetics' follow a compelling arc that respects the 'already/not yet' tension of the Christian life. While the sermon leans toward a more 'closed' theological conclusion, it avoids moralism by consistently pointing to the 'unavailable' grace of God. It is a 'sober' aesthetic that does not seek to entertain but to 'clothe' the hearer in a new reality.",

      "The 'Reframing' of military imagery into a theology of the Cross.",
      "The 'Anti-Kitsch' grounding of spiritual warfare in real-world persecution.",

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The 'Musicality' could be improved by pruning long biblical block-quotes for better oral flow.",
      "The 'Openness' could be enhanced by ending with a question rather than a declarative litany.",

    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Four Pages).",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers seeking intellectual depth and a 'non-sentimental' faith; those struggling with the 'good vs. evil' rhetoric of the early 2000s.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' to see how it affects the hearer's sense of agency.",
      "Use more 'staccato' rhythms in the middle sections to maintain the energy of the opening.",
      "Try to 'show' the internal battlegrounds (sin, sorrow) with the same vividness as the external ones (Mexico)."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically successful 'event' that manages to make the 'holy happen' (Immink) by connecting the ancient text to the urgent present. It avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch and moralism, instead opening a 'space for grace' where the hearer is invited to see their life as part of a larger, divine drama. It is a strong, authoritative performance of the Word."
