    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, utilizing the Nurturing Parent to provide a safe framework for the Free Child's joy. The preacher avoids the common trap of using Thanksgiving to 'guilt-trip' the congregation (Critical Parent). By sharing a personal story where she herself was the one who needed to learn (regarding the widow), she levels the playing field, maintaining an Adult-Adult transaction. The focus on 'freedom' and 'delight' over 'duty' and 'coercion' promotes psychological autonomy and spiritual health.",

    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The critique of the 'generic' cards could lean toward a 'Persecutor' role if expanded too far.",
      "The 'ought to be' statement regarding prayer lists is a brief flash of Critical Parent."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' and personal narratives of growth. To remain game-free, ensure that the 'Critical Parent' observations (like the prayer list length) remain framed as data for the Adult to consider rather than a command for the Adapted Child to obey."
