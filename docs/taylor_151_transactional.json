  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy, leaning heavily on the Nurturing Parent and Free Child ego states. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent (shaming). By emphasizing Jesus's humanity ('Tempted by sex? Yes.'), the preacher validates the listener's human experience (Adult/Child) rather than suppressing it. The 'Godly Failure' framing is a minor rhetorical device rather than a destructive game.",
    "strengths": [
      "High degree of emotional resonance and Free Child spontaneity.",
      "Avoidance of coercive 'must/should' language.",
      "Validation of human struggle and temptation."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Stupid!' outburst is a brief lapse into Critical Parent that breaks the supportive tone.",
      "Heavy reliance on 'mystery' can sometimes bypass the listener's Adult ego state."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To maintain Adult-Adult transparency, continue to provide the historical and logical context (as with the Pergamos example) before moving into the poetic/mystical Child-state appeals."
