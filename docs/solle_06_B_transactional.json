    "psychological_health_score": 2,
    "summary": "While theologically significant in its call for social justice, the sermon is psychologically coercive. It heavily utilizes the Critical Parent to induce guilt in the listener (Adapted Child). By framing the Gospel's universality as a 'trick,' it creates a high-stakes psychological game where the listener's spiritual belonging is held hostage to their political alignment. This creates a 'closed system' of communication that discourages authentic, autonomous faith in favor of ideological compliance.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the listener as an Adult capable of making their own ethical choices. Instead of using 'must' and 'tricks,' present the reality of suffering and invite a response from the Free Child's natural empathy rather than the Adapted Child's fear of judgment."
