    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes robust, tactile imagery to ground abstract theological concepts. The opening metaphor of 'warp and woof' immediately establishes a sensory framework for human emotion. The preacher effectively 'paints' the scene of Matthew at the tax booth, not just as a historical fact, but as a visceral experience of social exclusion. The description of Jesus' movement as a 'grand march' or 'campaign' provides a cinematic quality that moves the listener from the dusty roads of Capernaum to the cosmic scale of the 'Coronation'. However, some images lean toward the conventional (e.g., 'still waters and green pastures'), which prevents a higher score. The strength lies in the 'showing' of Matthew's internal state through external labels like 'stool pigeon' and 'bloodsucker', making the grace of Jesus' gaze more visible.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is generally clear and avoids dense academic jargon, opting instead for a 'folk-rhetoric' that is accessible yet dignified. There is a careful stewardship of words when describing the 'weird mixture' of humanity, using precise antonyms like 'lofty and low' or 'decency and filthiness'. However, the precision wavers in the middle section where 'violence and sex' are grouped into a general critique of media without nuanced distinction. The use of 'harlots and reprobates' for greedy preachers is sharp and precise, showing a refusal to hide behind polite euphemisms. The language care is evident in the rhythmic repetition, though it occasionally slips into more generalized 'Canaanite' expressions toward the conclusion.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are weird mixtures of angel and devil, decency and filthiness, coward and hero.",
        "Preachers who use the religious faith of people for their own unfair and disproportionate greed are harlots and reprobates.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This sermon excels in its oral quality. The rhythm is established through deliberate parallelisms and a 'call-and-response' structure inherent in the text. The use of alliteration ('lowness, foulness, filth') and the rhythmic repetition of 'Follow me' creates a liturgical cadence. The sentence length varies effectively, moving from short, declarative statements to longer, flowing descriptions of the 'grand march'. The conclusion, incorporating hymn lyrics, provides a melodic resolution that matches the 'musical' build-up of the preceding paragraphs. It is clearly a text written for the ear, utilizing the 'staccato' of the tax collector's coins and the 'legato' of the Lord's invitation.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is a way for heroes, fighting, forging ahead, falling, rising, forgiving, forgetting...",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon demonstrates a high degree of micro-aesthetic quality, particularly in its musicality and imagery. The preacher successfully avoids 'paper language' by employing a rhythmic, oral style that resonates with the African American homiletic tradition. Imagery is used not as decoration but as a tool for 'reframing' the tax collector Matthew. While some metaphors are conventional, the precision in describing the 'split' human nature (the 'weird mixture') provides a strong aesthetic foundation. The language is 'loving' in its attention to the human condition while remaining 'sharp' in its critique of greed and hypocrisy."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with the 'angel/devil' duality, moves to the 'complication' of social and internal sin (Matthew's booth), and reaches a 'climax' in the unexpected gaze of Jesus. The movement is not a static three-point lecture but a journey from the 'cane country' to the 'last mile'. The tension is maintained by the 'weird mixture' concept, which is never fully resolved but rather 'held' by the presence of the Leader. The conclusion offers a resolution that is both personal and eschatological. However, the 'hero' theme occasionally feels like a secondary arc that competes with the 'Matthew' narrative.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The integration of the biblical text (Matthew 9:9) with the contemporary context is the sermon's strongest structural feature. The preacher 'reframes' the publican Matthew using modern archetypes like 'Uncle Tom' and 'stool pigeon', making the ancient text startlingly relevant. The 'context' is not just social but psychological, utilizing Anne Frank and Paul to bridge the gap between the 1st and 20th centuries. The 'reframing' (Cilliers) occurs when the preacher shifts the focus from Matthew's 'filth' to Jesus' 'confidence'. The sermon does not just repeat the text; it performs it in the context of Detroit and the 'American makeup'.",
      "quotes": [
        "You will know something of the feeling from the words Uncle Tom, cat’s-paw, and stool pigeon.",
        "A man in Detroit told me some years ago of talking with one of the most famous men of our time.",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's weakest structural point in terms of the 'aesthetic turn'. While the sermon acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (the angel/devil mixture), the conclusion is quite 'closed'. It moves toward a traditional 'happy ending' with the 'Great King in His beauty'. The hearer is given a clear, almost moralistic directive to 'go on' and 'work till the close of the day'. While this provides comfort, it leaves little room for the 'polyvalence' Stark advocates. The 'hero' language can feel prescriptive, potentially closing the space for those who feel more like 'cowards' than 'heroes' at the sermon's end.",
      "quotes": [
        "You are safe in following him.",
        "Do you not plan to go on, to go on to see what the end will be?",

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Predominantly closed; the sermon moves toward a certain and resolved conclusion, leaving little room for interpretative ambiguity."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon possesses a strong narrative arc and exceptional integration of text and context. It successfully 'reframes' the biblical narrative for a modern audience, making the call of Matthew a contemporary event. However, the structure leans toward a 'closed' conclusion typical of traditional homiletics, which may limit the 'open work of art' quality. The 'dramaturgy' is effective in building tension through the human duality but resolves it perhaps too quickly through the 'hero' motif. Overall, it is a well-constructed 'event' that moves the listener from self-despair toward a vision of hope."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon walks a fine line between authentic depth and religious kitsch. The 'angel/devil' and 'hero' motifs risk becoming kitsch if they suggest a simple triumph of the will. However, the preacher avoids 'cheap comfort' by acknowledging the 'rotting flesh' and the 'howl of pain'. The 'Detroit' anecdote and the 'stool pigeon' references provide a grit that counters sentimentality. The ending, however, flirts with kitsch by using a 'happy ending' hymn that resolves all 'rocky ways' a bit too neatly. The 'Space for Grace' is nearly crowded out by the 'Hero' rhetoric, which can feel like a pre-chewed emotional category.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'Great King in His beauty' conclusion which resolves the 'rocky road' tension perhaps too smoothly.",
      "The 'You little angel' / 'You little devil' opening, while relatable, borders on a sentimental cliché."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'famous man' who doesn't really 'see' the other person.",
      "The visceral description of the 'bloodsucker' and 'dirty traitor' labels applied to Matthew."

    "recommendation": "To increase depth, focus less on the 'hero' (which can be a kitsch archetype) and more on the 'grace' that sustains the 'wretched man' even when he doesn't feel heroic."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is opened through the 'gaze of Jesus'—the idea that God sees something 'worthwhile' in the 'trash'. This is a profound opening of grace. However, the space is somewhat 'closed' by the 'hero' framing. If grace is an appeal to the 'hero in us', it risks becoming a 'grace of potential' rather than a 'grace for the dead'. Cilliers' 'reframing' is present, but the 'Space for Grace' is partially occupied by a call to 'work till the close of the day', shifting the focus from God's unavailable action to the human response.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained in the first half (Romans 7) but resolved through the 'Hero' motif in the second half.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of Jesus' choice of Matthew is respected, but the 'pathway of duty' at the end is very explained.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the 'gaze' of Jesus, but moralization ('work till the close') creeps in during the conclusion.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'Follow me' to remain a mystery of grace rather than an 'appeal to the hero'. Grace is most powerful when it appeals to the 'dead' in us, not the 'hero'."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of the 'New Homiletic' and the African American rhetorical tradition. Its primary strength lies in its 'micro-aesthetics'—the rhythm, the tactile imagery, and the oral 'flow' of the language. The preacher successfully 'reframes' the biblical text, making the ancient tax collector a mirror for the modern hearer. The 'dramaturgy' is effective, creating a sense of movement and 'event'. However, from the perspective of the 'aesthetic turn', the sermon is somewhat 'closed'. The 'hero' motif, while rhetorically powerful, risks overshadowing the radicality of grace by making it an appeal to human nobility rather than a gift to the 'wretched'. The conclusion is aesthetically 'safe' but lacks the 'polyvalence' of an 'open work of art'. Despite this, the sermon creates a genuine 'Space for Grace' through its emphasis on the transformative gaze of Christ.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional integration of contemporary social context with the biblical text.",
      "Strong oral rhythm and musicality that facilitates engagement.",
      "Vivid, sensory imagery that grounds theological truths in human experience."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Move away from 'closed' moralistic conclusions toward more 'open' endings.",
      "Deepen the critique of the 'hero' motif to avoid religious kitsch.",
      "Ensure the 'Space for Grace' remains focused on God's action rather than human 'duty'."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Dramatic with strong elements of 'Sober-Reformed' grit in the description of sin.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson and the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers, though less 'open' than Ciska Stark would prefer.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who value narrative, emotional resonance, and a clear sense of 'movement' in a sermon; particularly those in traditions that value the 'grand march' of faith.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer with the weight of the 'Follow me'.",
      "Use more 'staccato' language to describe the 'rocky road' to avoid sentimentalizing the struggle.",
      "Explore the 'coward' in us as much as the 'hero' to deepen the 'Space for Grace'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a well-crafted aesthetic event that succeeds in 'reframing' reality through the lens of Scripture. While it relies on some traditional 'closed' structures and archetypes (the 'hero'), its linguistic care and rhythmic power make it a compelling performance of the Gospel. It avoids the 'kitsch' of easy answers by acknowledging the 'weird mixture' of the human heart, even if it resolves that tension a bit too neatly in the final act. It is a 'good' to 'strong' sermon (6.8) that demonstrates the power of language to 'paint' the grace of God."
