    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily through historical and hypothetical anecdotes rather than consistent sensory language. The opening 'riddle' metaphor serves as an effective intellectual hook, but the sensory 'painting' advocated by Paul Scott Wilson is sparse. The preacher successfully 'shows' the limitation of a localized Jesus through the vivid imagery of ships and airplanes crowded with pilgrims to Jerusalem. However, much of the theological core remains in the realm of 'telling'—using abstract terms like 'universal,' 'localized,' and 'dispensation.' The imagery of the 'valley where the dark shadows lie' is a traditional trope that lacks fresh aesthetic impact. While the 'procession' of biblical characters provides some visual movement, the sermon relies more on conceptual metaphors than on evocative, sensory-rich descriptions of the biblical or contemporary world.",
      "quotes": [
        "Every ship that started to the East would be filled with Christian pilgrims, all determined to 'see Jesus.'",
        "The riddle, which at first seemed to disguise and hide and prevent any answer, actually contained the answer hidden within its bosom.",
        "Look at the procession of 'madewhole,' 'brought-back,' and 'second-chance' people who pass by where Jesus has been."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is characterized by a dignified, almost liturgical precision. There is a clear 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre) in the way the preacher distinguishes between a riddle and a puzzle. The vocabulary is sophisticated yet accessible, avoiding heavy academic jargon while maintaining theological weight. However, there is a tendency toward 'Canaanite' phrasing ('verily, verily,' 'dear Lord,' 'precious blood') which, while rhythmically pleasing, can sometimes obscure fresh meaning behind traditional piety. The precision is highest when the preacher describes his own 50-year struggle with the text, creating an authentic connection between the speaker and the Word. The phrasing is economical, with a clear sense of purpose in every sentence, avoiding unnecessary 'filler' words.",
      "quotes": [
        "To me a puzzle is more mechanical and less demanding of mental exercise. A riddle suggests more strongly that the mind is called on to give the answer.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest aesthetic suit. The preacher employs classical rhetorical devices—parallelism, anaphora, and varying sentence lengths—to create a compelling oral rhythm. The repetition of 'Greater works than these shall he do' toward the end functions like a musical refrain, building emotional and homiletical momentum. The cadence is 'legato' during the reflections on the 50-year ministry and 'staccato' during the list of Jesus' miracles. The use of triplets ('inextricably, indissolubly, and inseparably') creates a sense of completeness and authority. It is clearly a text written for the ear, possessing a 'flow' that guides the listener through the difficult theological paradox of the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "The mightiest preaching of the dear risen Lord has not yet been heard, the most moving music has not been sung, and the most powerful and prevailing prayers have not yet been prayed.",

    "average_score_language": 7,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high level of oral craftsmanship. While the imagery is somewhat traditional and leans toward the intellectual, the musicality and rhythmic precision are excellent. The preacher uses language as a liturgical instrument, creating a sense of gravitas and momentum. The 'stewardship of language' is evident in the careful distinctions made at the start, though the use of traditional pious adjectives slightly dampens the aesthetic freshness. It is a 'sober-Reformed' style that prioritizes the weight of the Word through rhythmic repetition and logical clarity."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Lowry-esque' plot: it begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' through the introduction of a 'riddle' that the preacher admits he couldn't solve for 50 years. This admission of vulnerability creates immediate tension and curiosity. The movement from the 'problem' (the impossibility of doing greater works than Jesus) to the 'clue' (the context of the ascension) provides a satisfying intellectual and spiritual journey. The turning point is clearly marked ('until two weeks ago — it all came clear'). The conclusion moves from the resolution of the riddle to an expansive, hopeful vision of the future. However, the 'middle' section becomes slightly repetitive as it lists the benefits of the ascension, slowing the narrative momentum.",
      "quotes": [
        "There is one passage which I have never dared to use as a text.",
        "No, sir, I was not about to try to preach that until two weeks ago — it all came clear.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon performs a classic 'reframing' (Cilliers) by shifting the focus from human effort ('our works') to the cosmic shift of the ascension ('because I go to the Father'). It connects the biblical world of the disciples' grief to the universal experience of losing a loved one. However, the 'contemporary context' is addressed in very broad strokes—mentioning 'hospitals,' 'foul governments,' and cities like 'Brooklyn and Budapest.' There is a lack of specific, 'thick' description of the modern world's challenges. The integration is more theological than existential; it explains how the text fits into a system of belief rather than how it disrupts or heals a specific modern situation. The 'reframing' is successful on a conceptual level but remains somewhat detached from the 'grit' of daily life.",
      "quotes": [
        "You who have lost someone you loved deeply... know something of how these people felt.",
        "Christ is equally in Brooklyn and in Budapest, equally in San Francisco and in Savannah.",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "In terms of Ciska Stark's 'open work of art,' this sermon leans toward being 'closed.' The preacher provides 'The Answer' (as the title suggests) to the riddle. While the admission of a 50-year struggle suggests openness, the conclusion is highly declarative and certain. It resolves the tension of the text through a traditional dogmatic lens (the Ascension and Intercession). There is little room left for the hearer to sit with the 'ambivalence of existence' or the 'not yet' of the 'greater works.' The ending is a series of 'He can' statements that, while comforting, don't invite the hearer into the interpretative process. It functions more as a 'masterclass' on a difficult text than an 'open invitation' to experience the mystery.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Answer to a Riddle [Title]",
        "Now, this is a mystery... [but then proceeds to explain it logically].",

        "Leave some aspects of the 'riddle' unanswered to allow for the 'mystery of God' (Cilliers) to remain.",
        "End with an invitation or a question rather than a series of definitive 'He can' statements.",
        "Acknowledge the 'greater works' that *haven't* happened yet to respect the hearer's reality of suffering."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent. It seeks to solve a problem rather than sustain a tension."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon has a strong, classical dramatic arc that moves from a personal confession of confusion to a triumphant theological resolution. It is structurally sound and keeps the listener engaged through a clear 'plot.' However, it suffers from a 'closed' ending that seeks to resolve all mystery through dogmatic explanation. The integration of context is broad and institutional rather than specific and existential. It is a well-built 'edifice' of a sermon, but one that perhaps leaves too little room for the hearer's own interpretive struggle."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids religious kitsch by grounding its hope in a genuine intellectual and spiritual struggle (the 50-year riddle). It does not offer 'cheap' comfort; the preacher acknowledges the 'dark shadows' and the pain of physical absence. However, the ending flirts with kitsch through its rapid-fire 'He can' declarations and the somewhat triumphalist list of 'foul governments falling.' This 'happy ending' approach (Cilliers) risks oversimplifying the complex reality of the church's history. Yet, the authentic admission of the preacher's own limitations as a 'witness' saves it from being purely manipulative sentiment.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The list of 'foul governments' falling and 'millions seeing the great light' feels like a simplified, triumphalist history.",
      "The phrase 'dear risen Lord' used repeatedly can feel like a pre-chewed emotional trigger."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The confession that the preacher 'never dared to use' this text for 50 years.",
      "The description of the disciples' grief as 'good-bye talk' and the comparison to losing a loved one."

    "recommendation": "To increase depth, balance the triumphalist list of 'greater works' with a lament for the 'works' still left undone, avoiding the 'happy ending' trap."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens 'space for grace' by shifting the focus from human performance to Christ's presence through the Spirit. By 'reframing' the text away from a demand for miracles toward a gift of global presence, it relieves the hearer of a legalistic burden. However, the 'space' is somewhat constricted by the preacher's need to provide a complete 'answer.' The mystery of the ascension is explained so logically (the 'branch office' vs. 'headquarters') that the 'holy' (Immink) risks becoming a mechanical theological transaction. The 'Space for Grace' is present in the promise of Christ's intercession, but it is a space that is very clearly 'mapped out' by the preacher.",

    "mystery_respected": "The mystery is acknowledged but then largely 'solved' through logical analogies.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails over moralization, as the 'works' are attributed to Christ's power, not human effort.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'riddle' to remain slightly perplexing. Grace is often most visible in the 'between' space where we don't have all the answers."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of mid-20th-century rhetorical homiletics. Its primary aesthetic strength lies in its musicality and its clear, narrative-driven structure. The preacher effectively uses his own biography—a 50-year 'riddle'—to create a dramatic arc that carries the listener toward a theological resolution. The language is dignified and rhythmic, showing a high degree of 'stewardship' and oral awareness. However, from the perspective of the 'aesthetic turn,' it is somewhat 'closed.' It functions as a didactic 'answer' rather than an 'open work of art' that invites the listener into the polyvalence of the text. The imagery, while clear, is often traditional or institutional, lacking the 'thick,' sensory description that characterizes contemporary aesthetic preaching. It successfully avoids the worst excesses of religious kitsch through its honest admission of difficulty, though it ends on a note of triumphalism that borders on the predictable. It is a 'sober-Reformed' performance that prioritizes the clarity of the Word over the ambiguity of the human condition.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rhetorical musicality and the use of rhythmic refrains.",
      "The '50-year riddle' narrative arc which creates authentic engagement.",
      "Clear conceptual reframing of the 'greater works' as a result of the Ascension."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase sensory imagery ('show, don't tell') to ground the theology in the physical world.",
      "Move away from a 'closed' structure that seeks to provide the 'final answer.'",
      "Incorporate more specific contemporary context to avoid institutional triumphalism."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Rhetorical-Didactic (Sober-Reformed influence)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Homiletical Plot' of Eugene Lowry combined with the 'Witness' model of Thomas Long.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to traditional congregations who value logical clarity, rhythmic delivery, and the authority of a seasoned 'witness.'",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the congregation with a reflective question.",
      "Use one specific, modern story of a 'greater work' of grace rather than a list of historical categories.",
      "Read the text through the lens of 'Inter-esse' (Cilliers), focusing on the tension between the 'already' and 'not yet'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a well-crafted piece of homiletical rhetoric that excels in its oral delivery and structural clarity. It successfully navigates a difficult text by reframing it through the Ascension. While it lacks the 'openness' and sensory 'thickness' of modern aesthetic homiletics, it remains a compelling performance of 'faith seeking understanding.' It is a 6.5—a solid, effective sermon that functions well within its tradition but misses the exceptional depth that comes from sustaining mystery and existential ambivalence."
