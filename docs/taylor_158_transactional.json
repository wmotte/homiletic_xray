While it attempts to offer comfort through the concept of Providence, it does so by reinforcing a 'Pay-to-Play' moral universe. The listener is trapped in a cycle of guilt and inevitable 'payment' for sins, both personal and ancestral. This creates a dependency on the 'Parent' (God/Preacher) for safety, rather than fostering an Adult-Adult relationship with the divine or the self.",
