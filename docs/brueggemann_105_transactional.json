    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and health-promoting. It avoids the common trap of using the Critical Parent to shame the congregation into praying. Instead, it uses the Adult ego state to analyze the 'imperatives' in the Lord's Prayer and then invites the listener's Free Child to be 'impudent' and 'shameless' before God. By using an 8-year-old girl as the primary model, the preacher validates the power of the Child ego state when it is uncoupled from the 'Adapted' (fearful/compliant) constraints. It promotes autonomy and agency rather than dependency.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'impudence' as a theological category; it is the perfect TA antidote to the 'Adapted Child' syndrome prevalent in many religious settings."
