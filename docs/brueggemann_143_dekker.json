The healed lame beggar in perfect health was clothed with power from on high. We too might be!"

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on one specific passage. It jumps between Acts 3, Psalm 4, and Luke 24. Consequently, it fails to identify what can be found 'nowhere else' in a specific text, opting instead for a general 'Easter' theme.",
      "quotes": [
        "In the Book of Acts we get much talk... from Peter and from Paul, and one very long one from Stephen",
        "So what if, eventually Psalm 4, our Psalm for today, is on the lips of the lame beggar",
        "Luke ends his Easter narrative (that we have read) this way"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one pericope (e.g., Acts 3:1-10) and exhaust its specific logic rather than using it as a springboard for a general thematic discourse on 'Easter talk/walk'."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of Greek/Hebrew study or engagement with the specific historical-theological context of the biblical books. The exegesis is replaced by a narrative retelling that serves the 'talk/walk' trope.",
      "quotes": [
        "The beggar wants some alms, some cash—maybe to drink it up.",
        "The apostles did not quibble... They did not debate whether the resurrection of Jesus was a spiritual or a physical event."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Investigate the specific Lucan theology of 'witness' and the temple context in Acts 3, rather than projecting modern assumptions about beggars 'drinking up' alms."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application touches on concrete issues (health care, minimum wage), but it does so in a way that feels like a list of general political desiderata rather than a specific application derived from the text's unique voice.",
      "quotes": [
        "the church engages in justice, all about health care and public housing and a minimum wage",
        "not to rescue capitalism... and not to enhance democracy"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'Easter walk' to the specific congregation's life rather than broad socio-political categories that function as 'general truths'."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon attempts to mix the story of the beggar with modern concerns about health care. However, because the exposition is thin, the 'interweaving' feels more like an allegory.",
      "quotes": [
        "The move from Easter talk to the Easter walk is from Jesus to the beggar.",
        "Talk about health care! Health care offered to the disadvantaged who cannot afford it!"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid separating the 'talk' (exposition) and the 'walk' (application) into distinct sections of the sermon; let the text's own movement dictate the contemporary relevance."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is present (the lame man), and redemption is mentioned (resurrection). However, the 'misery' is largely physical/social rather than 'misery before God'. Gratitude is framed as 'signing on' to a program.",
      "quotes": [
        "He will no longer sleep the cold restless sleep of a beggar on the street.",
        "we sign on—yet again—to talk the talk that transforms"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the category of 'misery' beyond social disadvantage to the theological lostness that Dekker emphasizes."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are virtually absent. There is no sense of the possibility of being lost or the ultimate seriousness of the human choice. The tone is one of empowerment and 'new life' without the shadow of destruction.",
      "quotes": [
        "Easter... permits us to talk the talk... allows us to walk the walk",
        "We are Easter people... empowered to raise others to new life."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'indictment' mentioned in the text more seriously. If the crowd 'killed the Author of life,' what is the consequence of continuing in that 'old tired mode'?"
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the one God raised, but the sermon quickly shifts the focus to human agency (the apostles and the church). Christ becomes a catalyst for human 'walking' rather than the telos who detaches man from himself.",
      "quotes": [
        "The talk is accomplished by God... But the walk is accomplished by the apostles, that is, by the church.",
        "It is the church’s business... to be about the Easter walk."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure Christ remains the telos. The sermon risks becoming a 'theology of glory' where the church's activity replaces the ongoing work of the living Lord."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1150 words, the sermon would last about 11-12 minutes. This is significantly below Dekker’s 20-minute minimum. The lack of 'breadth' results in a lack of 'depth'.",
      "improvement_point": "Increase the substantive engagement with the text and the humanities to reach the required depth; 11 minutes is insufficient for 'exposition and application'."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily due to its brevity, lack of specific textual focus, and the absence of the 'two ways'. It functions more as a thematic encouragement on social justice and 'Easter living' than a rigorous exposition of a specific Word of God. The transition from the work of God to the work of the church is too abrupt, risking a loss of the Christocentric telos.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application to socio-economic issues (health care, housing) avoids purely abstract spiritualization.",
      "Attempts to link the Old Testament (Psalm 4) with the New Testament narrative, showing an awareness of the unity of Scripture."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (approx. 11 minutes) precludes the 'breadth' required for theological depth.",
      "Lack of specific exegesis; the preacher does not demonstrate the 'bicycle mechanic's' skill with the original languages or context.",
      "Absence of the 'two ways'; the sermon lacks the urgency of the possibility of being lost."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker’s definition. It is a thematic speech about 'Easter' and 'social action' that uses biblical passages as illustrations rather than allowing a specific text to be the sovereign starting point. It lacks the formal rigor and the substantive 'two ways' necessary for true proclamation."
