However, it heavily reinforces a Parent-Child dynamic, which provides comfort but may limit the development of 'Adult' autonomy. It validates the 'Free Child's' right to feel anger and sorrow, which is a significant psychological strength.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Incorporate more 'Adult-to-Adult' transactions by asking the congregation how they might use their agency to 'walk the valley' rather than just 'being blessed' within it."
