    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily through the lens of the biblical texts it cites, particularly the 'new heaven and new earth' of Isaiah. Brueggemann (or the preacher) successfully translates ancient metaphors into modern socio-economic images such as 'foreclosures' and 'infant mortality.' However, the preacher's own original language is more conceptual than sensory. While the 'Easter power' is described as being 'loose in the world,' much of the sermon relies on 'telling' the significance of the images rather than 'showing' them through narrative detail. The imagery serves a rhetorical-didactic purpose rather than a purely poetic one. The sensory depth is moderate; we 'see' the wolf and lamb because the text says so, but the preacher doesn't paint the scene further.",
      "quotes": [
        "God’s Easter power for life is loose in the world.",
        "He mentions everything except the oil spill; if he had known that, he would have included it in his inventory of disasters.",
        "It is not a vision of heaven with gold streets and angels and harps. It is a vision of a new earth, a new policy to end infant mortality..."

        "Effective modernization of biblical metaphors (e.g., vineyards as economy).",
        "Strong opening metaphor of power being 'loose'.",
        "Clear contrast between 'gold streets' (cliché) and concrete earthly needs."
      ],

        "Incorporate more sensory details (smell, touch, sound) beyond the visual.",

        "Develop the 'oil spill' or 'neighborhood' imagery into a more immersive scene."

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Leans toward 'telling'. The preacher explains the implications of images rather than letting the images perform the work."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise and avoids traditional 'Canaanite' jargon by reframing theological concepts into civic and ethical categories. The preacher exhibits 'stewardship of language' by defining terms like 'spiritual but not religious' as a 'drop-out formula.' There is a clear effort to be nuanced about Paul’s 'no work, no food' comment, rescuing it from political misuse. The word choice is deliberate and hits the core of the 'neighborhood' vs. 'self-preoccupation' tension. While the language is not highly ornate, it is disciplined and avoids the fluff of religious kitsch. The precision lies in the naming of social realities (greed, fear, threat) as the 'habitat' of the old world.",
      "quotes": [
        "The new popular mantra, 'I am spiritual but not religious,' is often a drop-out formula.",
        "The old world of greed and fear and threat has failed.",
        "The Greek is, 'I will give you mouth.' You will know what to say..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent deconstruction of the 'spiritual but not religious' cliché.",
        "Careful exegetical correction of 2 Thessalonians 3:10.",
        "Avoidance of vague 'churchy' language in favor of concrete social terms."

        "Some repetitive use of 'new world' and 'old world' could be varied.",
        "The transition between the three points is somewhat formulaic ('First', 'Second', 'Third').",
        "Could further sharpen the 'Orange Alert' metaphor for a more timeless precision."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Low jargon; theological terms like 'Easter' and 'Shalom' are immediately grounded in practice."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a strong rhetorical cadence, likely influenced by the rhythms of the Hebrew prophets. There is frequent use of parallelism ('no task, no discipline, no summons') and repetitive structures that build momentum. The sentence length varies effectively, moving from short, punchy imperatives ('Watch your mouth!') to longer, flowing descriptions of God’s future. The use of the 'I have a dream' structure for the Isaiah passage creates a liturgical and historical resonance that is musically satisfying. It is clearly 'oral language' designed to be heard, with a natural flow that suggests a seasoned speaker who understands the power of the pause and the list.",
      "quotes": [
        "No task, no discipline, no summons, and no accountability.",
        "They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat.",
        "Watch your mouth! The Bible knows, of course, that the human tongue, human speech, is a huge instrument..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of triads and parallelisms for emphasis.",
        "Strong imperative 'Watch your mouth!' breaks the rhythm and grabs attention.",
        "The 'I have a dream' section provides a rhythmic climax."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'First, Second, Third' structure is a bit staccato and predictable.",
        "Some sentences in the conclusion become slightly cluttered with 'and... and...'.",
        "Could use more alliteration or assonance to make key phrases 'stickier'."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Strong oral language; the text breathes and moves with a speaker's pulse."
    },
    "average_score_language": 6.67,
    "summary_language": "The sermon's language is rhetorically robust and grounded in a 'sober beauty.' It avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by eschewing sentimentalism for concrete social ethics. While it lacks high-sensory poetic immersion (showing), it excels in linguistic stewardship (precision) and prophetic cadence (rhythm). The preacher successfully 'reframes' biblical imagery into contemporary socio-political realities, making the 'old world' and 'new world' palpable through contrast rather than through flowery adjectives. It is a text that values clarity and 'truth-telling' over aesthetic decoration."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a traditional 'three-point' structure (Contribute, Watch your mouth, Live in hope). While this provides clarity, it lacks a sophisticated narrative arc or 'Lowry loop.' The 'upsetting of the equilibrium' is present in the introduction—the church doesn't know how to live in Easter power—but the movement toward the 'turning point' is more an accumulation of advice than a dramatic journey. There is a sense of progression from individual action (work) to speech (mouth) to cosmic vision (hope), but the tension is intellectual rather than visceral. The energy remains relatively constant rather than building toward a singular 'event' or epiphany.",
      "quotes": [
        "So here is the counsel I read in these texts.",
        "Second practice of discipleship: Watch your mouth!",
        "Now third, Live in hope."

      "strengths": [
        "Clear, logical progression that is easy for the hearer to follow.",

        "Move away from the 'First, Second, Third' numbering to a more organic flow.",

        "The transition to the Isaiah text feels like a new beginning rather than a climax."

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. The preacher masterfully 'reframes' (Cilliers) the biblical texts. The 'idle' of Thessalonica are reframed as the 'spiritual but not religious' drop-outs of today. The 'wars and rumors of wars' in Luke are integrated with the 'oil spill' and 'immigration policy.' The Isaiah vision is reframed through the lens of Martin Luther King Jr. This creates a 'space' where the biblical world and the contemporary world are not just compared, but synthesized. The 'strangeness' of the text (e.g., 'I will give you mouth') is preserved and then made relevant. It offers a genuine new frame for looking at the 'status quo.'",
      "quotes": [
        "He mentions everything except the oil spill; if he had known that, he would have included it in his inventory.",
        "It anticipates Martin Luther King Jr. and 'I Have a Dream.'",

        "Brilliant synthesis of Isaiah 65 with modern socio-economics.",
        "Organic connection between Paul’s 'work' and modern 'accountability'.",
        "The 'Orange Alert' metaphor perfectly captures the contemporary context of fear."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection to 'health care' could be slightly more developed than just a list item.",
        "Could explore the 'strangeness' of the wolf and lamb metaphor more deeply.",
        "Ensure the 'neighborhood' context is as specific as the national/political context."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing. It successfully shifts the hearer's gaze from 'self-preoccupation' to 'neighborhood' via the text."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is somewhat 'closed' in its moral imperatives. While it avoids a 'happy ending' kitsch, it leans heavily on 'summons' and 'calling.' The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long), which is strong, but the 'First, Second, Third' structure can feel a bit like a 'coercive schema' (Stark). However, it remains 'open' by acknowledging the 'bewilderment' of the world and the 'strangers' in the room. The ending is an invitation to 'joy and well-being,' but it leaves the specific 'enacting' to the congregation. It respects the hearer as a 'mature conversation partner' by dealing with tough policy issues rather than offering platitudes.",
      "quotes": [
        "The summons is how the church—people like us—can give daily evidence...",
        "I dare to go there, even though you are all strangers to me...",
        "It is clear that the old world... has failed. But it is not clear to many that there is an alternative."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the difficulty of the texts ('this really hard Gospel reading').",
        "Invites the hearer into a 'dream' rather than just a 'duty'.",
        "Leaves room for the 'bewilderment' of the world."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The conclusion could end with a more open-ended question rather than a summary.",
        "Reduce the 'we must'/ 'everyone has to' language to allow more space for the 'Holy' to act.",
        "Allow for more 'ambivalence' regarding the difficulty of 'contributing'."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Predominantly monovalent (one clear interpretation), but with an 'open' invitation to participate."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon is structurally sound and intellectually engaging, excelling particularly in the 'reframing' of ancient texts for a modern context. Its dramaturgy is more didactic than narrative, following a clear but somewhat predictable three-point movement. While it lacks a high-tension plot arc, it creates a compelling 'space' for the congregation to reconsider their social habitat. It balances the 'trouble' of the world (oil spills, fear) with the 'grace' of God's promise (Isaiah's dream), though it leans heavily on the church's response as the primary evidence of that grace."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'pre-chewed emotions' and 'cheap comfort.' Instead of a 'happy ending,' it speaks of 'crunch time,' 'persecution,' and 'social unrest.' It does not use 'Jesus' as a magic wand to fix the oil spill or health care, but as a 'wisdom' that leads to 'trouble.' The emotions are authentic—rooted in the 'pain of suffering' and the 'bewilderment' of the world. By grounding 'hope' in a concrete 'new economy' and 'new health care,' it avoids the 'sentimental' kitsch of a disembodied heaven.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None significant; the preacher explicitly rejects the 'gold streets and angels' cliché.",
      "The mention of 'joy' is always tied to 'justice,' preventing it from becoming a kitsch sentiment."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission that 'you are all strangers to me' creates an authentic, non-manipulative connection.",
      "The naming of 'Orange Alert' as a habitat of despair is a sharp, authentic cultural diagnosis."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'sober beauty' by continuing to ground theological promises in gritty, socio-political realities."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens 'space for grace' by presenting God's power as something 'loose in the world'—an operative reality beyond human control. However, it quickly pivots to 'how to respond,' which shifts the focus to human effort (contribute, watch, live). While Cilliers argues that aesthetics should open space for the 'unavailable,' this sermon is very much about the 'available' tasks of the church. The 'mystery' of God is somewhat subordinated to the 'ethics' of the new world. Nevertheless, the 'Isaiah dream' section restores some of this space by emphasizing that 'God will give it, and will not stop until all is well.'",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between the 'old world' and 'new world' are sustained, though the 'trouble' in the Gospel is resolved perhaps a bit too quickly by the promise of 'not a hair of your head will perish.'",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of God's action is respected, but the sermon is primarily interested in the 'visibility' of that action through the church.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Moralization (the 'summons' to act) prevails over the 'vertical' dimension of grace, though it is a 'grace-based' ethics.",
    "recommendation": "Allow more time for the 'unavailability' of God's power—let the 'Easter power' be the actor for a longer stretch before moving to the 'summons'."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of 'Prophetic-Ethical' aesthetics. It avoids the 'visual excess' and 'sentimental kitsch' often found in contemporary preaching, opting instead for a 'sober beauty' that finds its power in the precision of language and the reframing of reality. Its greatest aesthetic achievement is the 'integration of text and context,' where ancient scriptures are made to speak directly to modern anxieties like 'Orange Alerts' and 'oil spills.' While the structural dramaturgy is somewhat traditional and didactic (the three-point plan), the rhythmic cadence and rhetorical 'stewardship of language' keep the listener engaged. It creates a space for the 'New World' to be imagined, though it places a heavy emphasis on the church's role in 'enacting' that world. It is a sermon that appeals to the 'active participant' rather than the 'passive consumer,' fitting Ciska Stark's 'appropriation' model, even if the interpretive path is fairly directed by the preacher's strong prophetic voice.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of biblical texts into contemporary socio-political categories.",
      "Rhetorical rhythm and cadence that echoes the Hebrew prophets.",
      "Complete avoidance of religious kitsch and sentimentalism."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The 'First, Second, Third' structure inhibits a more dynamic narrative arc.",
      "Heavy reliance on 'telling' and 'summons' rather than 'showing' through sensory narrative.",
      "The 'Space for Grace' is sometimes crowded out by the 'Summons to Work'."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Rhetorical (Sober-Reformed influence)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing), Thomas Long (Preacher as Witness), Paul Scott Wilson (Four Pages - though needs more 'showing').",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to socially-conscious, intellectually engaged hearers who value clarity, social justice, and the deconstruction of religious clichés.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a 'Lowry Loop' or narrative structure to increase dramaturgical tension.",
      "Incorporate one 'deep' sensory scene (show, don't tell) to ground the abstract 'new world'.",
      "End with an open-ended image or question to increase the 'Opera Aperta' quality."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically effective piece of prophetic rhetoric. It achieves a high degree of 'truth-telling' through precise language and successful contextual integration. While it lacks the 'poetic' shimmer of a more imagistic style or the 'dramatic' tension of a narrative plot, its 'sober beauty' and authentic engagement with the world's 'bewilderment' make it a compelling work. It successfully opens a 'space' for a new reality, even if it immediately fills that space with the work of the congregation. It is a 6.5-7.0: a very good, functional, and rhetorically disciplined sermon that avoids the common aesthetic traps of modern preaching."
