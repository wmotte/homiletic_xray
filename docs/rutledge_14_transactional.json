Instead of using fear to induce compliance (Adapted Child), the preacher uses global reality to justify the necessity of a 'Judge.' She avoids the trap of 'Ain't It Awful' by grounding the darkness in a specific liturgical purpose (Advent) and ending with an empowering call to 'build one another up.'",
