By telling the congregation they would be 'nothing' and 'worthless' without Christ, it creates a deficit that only the preacher's message can fill. This creates a cycle of dependency. The 'Open Door' is the Con—a promise of power—but the Gimmick is the listener's fear of being 'obscure.' The payoff is a feeling of relief that is contingent on continued compliance.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as Adult subjects capable of making choices based on values rather than fear of obscurity. Reduce the use of 'ought' and 'must' to allow the Free Child to emerge without the weight of the Critical Parent."
