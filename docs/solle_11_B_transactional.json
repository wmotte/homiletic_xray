    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of 'Prophetic Law' that functions psychologically as a series of heavy Critical Parent transactions. While theologically profound in its solidarity with the poor, it relies on 'NIGYSOB' and 'Ain't It Awful' to create a climate of existential guilt. The listener is not invited to an Adult-Adult dialogue but is cornered into a confession of global complicity. This often leads to 'Adapted Child' compliance or 'Rebellious Child' rejection rather than authentic, autonomous ethical change.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of Adult reality-testing regarding global issues.",
      "Strong poetic imagery that engages the Free Child's imagination."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on the 'Critical Parent' to induce change.",
      "The use of 'I' as a rhetorical weapon rather than authentic vulnerability."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as Adult subjects capable of making choices, rather than defining them as inherently guilty participants in a system they cannot escape. Move from 'Who hit Jesus?' (Search for a culprit) to 'How can we act today?' (Adult problem-solving)."
