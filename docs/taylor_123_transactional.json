    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Redemption' dynamics. It uses high-pressure Critical Parent language to deconstruct the listener's 'Adult' confidence (labeling it as 'deadness') before providing a Free Child emotional release through the Resurrection narrative. While theologically orthodox for Easter, the psychological movement relies on creating a 'shiver' of inadequacy to make the 'joy' effective.",

      "Over-reliance on CP 'deadness' labels to create tension.",
      "Dismissal of the Adult ('human reasoning') creates a dependency on the preacher's 'supralogical' authority.",
      "The political 'interview' section feels like a sudden Parent-to-Parent 'Ain't It Awful' transaction about the nation."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation's 'Adult' capacity to choose life, rather than declaring them 'dead' from a Parent position. Use 'we' more consistently when discussing spiritual struggle to avoid the Rescuer/Persecutor switch."
