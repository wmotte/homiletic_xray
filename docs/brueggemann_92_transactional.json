    "summary": "This sermon is exceptionally healthy from a TA perspective. It avoids the common 'Critical Parent' traps of apocalyptic preaching. Instead, it uses the Adult ego state to analyze reality and the Free Child to envision a hopeful future. It promotes autonomy by framing the Christian life as a series of conscious choices in response to societal shifts.",
    "strengths": [

      "The transition from the 'ordeal' of Rome to the 'ordeal' of modern privilege is a strong Adult move, but could be perceived as a 'Parental' lecture by those resistant to the political implications."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'we' to maintain the Adult-Adult contract. Ensure that the 'Free Child' imagery of heaven remains an invitation rather than a 'Nurturing Parent' demand to be happy."
