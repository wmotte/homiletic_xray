    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of common homiletical games. By operating from a strong Adult ego position, the preacher invites the listener into a complex reflection on justice and grace. He avoids the trap of the Critical Parent by identifying himself with the 'ungodly,' thereby creating a 'We are both not-OK, but accepted' dynamic. The use of current, controversial events serves as reality-testing (Adult) rather than fear-mongering.",
    "strengths": [

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' instead of 'you' when discussing sin to prevent the 'Persecutor' role. Maintain the tension of the 'uncomfortable' gospel to prevent the 'Rescuer' game."
