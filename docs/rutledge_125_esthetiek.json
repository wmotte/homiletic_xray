    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes strong, contrasting imagery. It moves from the 'highbrow' intellectual landscape of journals to the visceral, 'very dry' bones of Ezekiel. Rutledge effectively employs the biblical imagery of the valley of bones, not merely as an ancient text but as a sensory reality. She invokes the 'rattling' of bones and the 'clouded eyes' of a dying woman. The imagery serves the theological point: the stark contrast between the dryness of human effort and the 'breath' of the Spirit. However, some metaphors remain slightly abstract when discussing 'the epicenter of cultural cool,' which relies more on social signaling than sensory evocation.",

        "The foot bone connected to the leg bone, now hear the Word of the Lord!",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Rutledge exhibits high 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre). Her word choice is deliberate, avoiding 'Canaanite jargon' while rehabilitating heavy theological terms like 'righteousness' and 'myth.' She is precise in her definitions, particularly when distinguishing between 'sentiment' and 'emotion' regarding deathbed scenes. The language is sophisticated yet accessible, showing a deep respect for the weight of words. She avoids the 'warm fuzzy' clichés she critiques, opting for a 'sober beauty' that aligns with Reformed aesthetics.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is not a warm fuzzy version of the gospel; it certainly won’t be seen on any bumper stickers.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a distinct oral cadence, likely reflecting Rutledge’s experience as a preacher. There is a clear use of staccato sentences for emphasis ('Who believes this stuff?', 'And yet... and yet.'). The inclusion of the spirituals provides a rhythmic 'hook' that grounds the intellectual discourse in a more musical, communal tradition. The flow is logical but punctuated by rhetorical questions that maintain a pulse. It avoids the 'bureaucratic' tone of academic lectures, maintaining a 'legato' feel in the more reflective, grace-oriented passages.",
      "quotes": [
        "Dry bones reconnected! Lazarus popping up out of his tomb!",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The sermon displays a high degree of linguistic care and precision. Rutledge avoids the 'kitsch' of easy comfort by using sharp, unsentimental language. Her imagery is grounded in the biblical text, effectively 'showing' the dryness of the human condition before 'showing' the life-giving breath of God. The musicality is driven by rhetorical urgency and the rhythmic inclusion of spirituals, ensuring the sermon functions as an oral event rather than a static essay. It honors the 'stewardship of language' by treating theological concepts as living realities rather than dead jargon."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a sophisticated 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with a cultural challenge (the 'discarded myth'). It then introduces a deep conflict: the fear of death and the inadequacy of human righteousness (the McInerney story). The 'turning point' is not a human solution but the 'in-breaking' of God's holy name in Ezekiel. The tension is sustained throughout—Rutledge does not resolve the mother's fear with easy sentiment but with the radical 'otherness' of God's grace. The conclusion brings the disparate threads (Ezekiel, Lazarus, McInerney) into a unified call to 'come forth.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Who believes this stuff? Certainly, this calls for unblinking scrutiny.",
        "The good news is that God’s ultimate purpose of mercy for humanity is not for our sake.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a prime example of Cilliers' 'reframing.' Rutledge takes the contemporary context (the New Yorker, cultural elites, the fear of a 'saintly' woman) and reframes it through the lens of Ezekiel’s valley. She does not 'smooth over' the strangeness of the text; instead, she uses its strangeness to expose the shallowness of contemporary 'attenuated' religion. The synthesis is organic—the 'dry bones' of Israel become the 'dry bones' of a secular culture that has lost hope. She respects the 'then' of the Babylonian exile while making it a 'now' for the congregation in Connecticut.",

        "The valley of bones represents the whole nation of Israel... gone hopelessly astray.",

      "reframing_present": "Strongly present; reality is reframed from 'earning peace' to 'receiving life'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is rhetorically powerful, it leans toward a 'closed' theological system. Rutledge is firm in her orthodoxy. However, she leaves 'space' (Stark) by acknowledging the difficulty of belief ('Who believes this stuff?') and by leaving the 'mystery' of the deathbed scene somewhat open. She does not offer a 'happy ending' for the mother in a kitschy sense, but points to a hope that lies outside human control. The hearer is invited into the mystery of the 'unavailability' of God’s grace, which provides a level of polyvalence, though the dogmatic boundaries are clearly marked.",
      "quotes": [
        "O Lord God, thou knowest.",
        "Perhaps, in some way that you and I cannot foresee, there will be still something more revealed.",
        "A strong case can be made that this is nothing but wishful thinking."

      "strengths": [
        "The use of Ezekiel’s 'Thou knowest' models a healthy openness/submission to mystery.",
        "Acknowledges the validity of doubt and skepticism.",
        "Avoids moralistic 'closed' endings by focusing on God's action."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The critique of 'urbane' people can feel a bit like a 'closed' us-vs-them circle.",
        "The theological 'answer' is provided quite forcefully, leaving less room for the hearer's own 'appropriation' of the struggle.",
        "The ending, while powerful, is very declarative; a more 'open' question might have lingered longer."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A 'semi-open' work; it respects the mystery of God but is monovalent in its theological conviction."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is high, characterized by a strong narrative arc that sustains tension between cultural skepticism and divine revelation. Rutledge excels at 'reframing' contemporary existential fear through the lens of Ezekiel’s vision, creating a creative synthesis that feels both ancient and urgent. While the sermon is theologically 'closed' in its firm commitment to the 'central myth,' it creates space for grace by honoring the mystery of God's sovereign action and the reality of human doubt. The structure moves effectively from 'trouble' to 'grace' (Wilson)."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is a masterclass in anti-kitsch. Rutledge explicitly attacks 'religious kitsch'—the 'warm fuzzy' gospel, the 'sentimental' deathbed scenes, and the 'attenuated comforts' of liberal religion. She refuses to offer 'immediate comfort' to McInerney’s mother, instead validating her fear as a sign of taking God seriously. The 'beauty' here is the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed tradition: the 'rattling bones' are not beautified, and the 'stench' of death is not masked by perfume. By sustaining the 'bad news,' she allows the 'good news' to be authentic rather than sentimental.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'warm fuzzy version of the gospel' on bumper stickers (critiqued).",
      "The 'sentimental thing' people believe about near-death experiences (critiqued)."

      "The mother's 'snap' at her son: 'Don’t say that... I’ve done a terrible thing.'",
      "The admission that 'wishful thinking never created a crucified savior.'"

    "recommendation": "Maintain this rigorous rejection of sentimentality; it is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace precisely by closing the door on human merit. By emphasizing that God acts 'for the sake of his holy name' and not 'for our sake,' Rutledge removes the 'moralistic burden' from the hearer. This creates a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) where the 'Holy happens' as an objective act of God. The tension between 'already' and 'not yet' is sustained in the discussion of McInerney's mother—she is not 'saved' by her good works, but by a 'righteousness' that 'snatches us from the jaws of death.'",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'saintly' reputation and the 'terrible thing' is held until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'Thou knowest' of Ezekiel is the pivot of the sermon, respecting the unavailable nature of God's power.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails completely; moralization is explicitly rejected as 'poor economy.'",
    "recommendation": "To open even more space, the preacher could invite the congregation to sit longer in the 'dryness' of the valley before the 'rattling' begins."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.7,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a sophisticated aesthetic achievement within the 'Aesthetic Turn.' It rejects the 'superficial beautification' of the message in favor of a 'sober beauty' that allows the form of the biblical text (Ezekiel's vision) to dictate the form of the sermon. Rutledge’s use of contemporary literary culture (McInerney) serves as a 'reframing' device that makes the ancient text startlingly present. The sermon's greatest aesthetic strength is its 'anti-kitsch' stance; it refuses cheap grace and sentimental comfort, thereby making the eventual proclamation of the Gospel ('Lazarus, come forth') feel earned and authentic. The language is precise, the dramaturgy is tense and forward-moving, and the theological 'Space for Grace' is wide, grounded in the 'otherness' of God's holy name.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rigorous anti-kitsch stance that validates human pain and sin.",
      "Masterful 'reframing' of contemporary memoir through prophetic vision.",
      "Strong narrative arc that moves from intellectual skepticism to divine summons."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduce the 'us-vs-them' rhetoric regarding 'urbane' critics to increase polyvalence.",
      "Update or broaden cultural references to ensure they don't feel 'dated' (e.g., Jesus Seminar).",
      "Increase sensory 'showing' in the contemporary applications to match the vividness of the biblical scenes."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Poetic-Imagistic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Anti-kitsch) and Paul Scott Wilson (Trouble/Grace structure).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'intellectually honest' hearers, skeptics, and those weary of 'sentimental' religion.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'open' ending to allow the hearer more room for appropriation.",
      "Deepen the 'musicality' by using more poetic devices like alliteration in the grace-sections.",
      "Continue to use 'high culture' as a foil for the 'strangeness' of the Gospel."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A high-quality sermon that demonstrates how 'form is content.' By refusing to 'beautify' the dry bones, Rutledge allows the aesthetic power of the resurrection to shine through with 'dazzlement.' It is a model of how to preach to a secularized, sophisticated audience without compromising the 'radicality' of the Word. It successfully creates a space where 'the holy happens' through the intersection of a well-told human story and a vividly rendered divine vision."
