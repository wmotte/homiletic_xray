    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in utilizing the inherent imagery of the Ezekiel and Lazarus texts, though it relies heavily on the biblical narrative's existing power rather than inventing new metaphors. The preacher effectively invokes the 'rattling' of bones and the 'bandages' of Lazarus to ground the theological concepts. The use of the Jay McInerney memoir provides a contemporary 'image' of the deathbed, which serves as a modern mirror to the valley of dry bones. However, some metaphors remain slightly traditional ('siren call', 'jaws of death'). The strength lies in the preacher's ability to make the listener 'see' the dry bones through the eyes of the exiled Hebrews, connecting the physical dryness to spiritual despair.",
      "quotes": [
        "The bones were very many, and they were very dry.",

        "Could incorporate more contemporary sensory details outside of the literary quotes.",
        "Some metaphors (e.g., 'siren call') are slightly clichéd.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "The sermon leans toward 'showing' through the use of narrative (McInerney and Ezekiel), but 'tells' the theological conclusion quite directly."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and demonstrates high 'stewardship of language.' The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' while maintaining theological depth. Words like 'attenuated,' 'urbane,' and 'benighted' are used with surgical precision to set the scene of cultural conflict. The preacher carefully distinguishes between 'sentiment' and 'faith,' and between 'righteousness' and 'God's nature.' There is a clear effort to define the 'Gospel' in a way that is not 'warm fuzzy,' showing a commitment to truth over easy comfort. The nuance in discussing the mother's fear versus the son's anger shows a high level of human and linguistic sensitivity.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is not a warm fuzzy version of the gospel; it certainly won’t be seen on any bumper stickers.",
        "The attenuated comforts of the modernized Anglican tradition, its celebrated tolerance and latitude overlaid with just a touch of mystery.",

        "Ensure the 'highbrow' references don't alienate those outside that specific cultural frame."

      "jargon_analysis": "Theological jargon is minimal; when used (e.g., 'covenant community'), it is contextualized within the narrative."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a distinct oral cadence, particularly in the sections where the preacher echoes the rhythm of the Ezekiel text and the spirituals. There is a effective use of staccato sentences for emphasis ('Who believes this stuff?', 'And yet... and yet.'). The repetition of 'for the sake of my holy name' creates a liturgical rhythm that anchors the second half of the sermon. The flow from the intellectual critique of the beginning to the spiritual invitation of the end is handled with a smooth, crescendo-like movement. It avoids 'paper language' by maintaining a conversational yet elevated tone.",
      "quotes": [
        "Dry bones reconnected! Lazarus popping up out of his tomb! Who believes this stuff?",
        "And yet … and yet.",

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Primarily oral language; the structure suggests it was written to be heard."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by a 'sober beauty' and intellectual rigor. The preacher uses language as a precise instrument to dissect cultural skepticism before rebuilding a biblical vision. Imagery is drawn directly from the text and supplemented by poignant contemporary literature, creating a 'cinematic' bridge between the New Yorker and the Valley of Dry Bones. The rhythm is controlled and purposeful, avoiding the 'kitsch' of over-emotionalism while maintaining a steady, rhythmic pulse that leads the hearer toward the final 'Lazarus' call."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a masterful 'Lowry-esque' plot. It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with the critique of the 'central myth.' It introduces a conflict: the intellectual rejection of faith versus the existential reality of death (the McInerney story). The tension builds as the preacher explores the 'bad news' of judgment and sin, creating a 'homiletical itch' that only the Gospel can scratch. The turning point is the revelation that God acts 'for the sake of His name,' not our merit. The conclusion provides a resolution that doesn't just end the sermon but invites the hearer into the story of Lazarus.",
      "quotes": [
        "All the truly intelligent, urbane, sophisticated people are somewhere else this morning...",
        "With all due respect, the church failed Mrs. McInerney somewhere along the way.",

      "strengths": [
        "Clear movement from cultural critique to existential crisis to theological solution.",
        "The use of the McInerney story as a recurring narrative thread.",
        "A conclusion that effectively ties the Ezekiel and John texts together."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition from the McInerney story to the 'trip with Ezekiel' could be slightly more organic.",
        "The explanation of the Old Testament lessons being 'mountaintop passages' is a bit 'meta' and slows the arc.",
        "The middle section on the mechanics of the Spirit could be more tightly integrated into the narrative tension."

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a textbook example of Cilliers' 'reframing.' The preacher takes the contemporary context (secular skepticism and the 'New Yorker' memoir) and reframes it through the lens of Ezekiel. The 'central myth' is not defended defensively; rather, reality is placed inside the myth. The connection between the dying mother's fear and the 'dry bones' of Israel is surprising yet feels inevitable. The preacher respects the 'strangeness' of Ezekiel (the rattling bones) while making it speak directly to the 'cultural cool' of the 1990s. It avoids the 'two-block' problem by weaving the text and context together throughout.",
      "quotes": [
        "Even more seductive than the siren call of The New York Review of Books is the idea... that you can soak up the rituals... without actually believing.",
        "Ezekiel, like Revelation, requires that you not be literal-minded.",
        "His determined purpose to raise the dead is a constituent part of who he is."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant use of contemporary literature to illustrate biblical truth.",
        "Reframes 'sin' not as a moralistic list but as a 'sickness unto death' that requires a miracle.",
        "Honors the historical context of the Babylonian exile while applying it to modern 'spiritual dryness'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could perhaps address the 'Lazarus' text earlier to create a more balanced 'reframing' of both readings.",
        "The 'Jesus Seminar' reference might be dated for modern hearers, though appropriate for 1999.",
        "The transition to the mother's 'deathbed vision' could be handled with more critical caution to avoid appearing to validate 'near-death' sentimentality too quickly."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing: the 'central myth' is presented as the only reality deep enough to handle the 'terrible thing' of sin."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is intellectually open and acknowledges doubt and the 'scoffings of the cultural elite,' the theological conclusion is quite 'closed' in a traditional sense. It moves toward a definitive 'Amen' and a call to 'Submit.' However, it leaves room for the 'mystery' of God's action and the 'unforeseen' ways God might work in the life of someone like McInerney. It treats the hearer as a mature conversation partner who is aware of the 'New York Review of Books.' It avoids easy moralism but does provide a very specific dogmatic answer to the 'dry bones' question.",
      "quotes": [
        "Lord, only thou knowest.",
        "Perhaps, in some way that you and I cannot foresee, there will be still something more revealed...",
        "Whatever tomb you feel may be closing in upon you... it is no match for the Holy Spirit."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the validity of doubt and the difficulty of belief.",
        "Ends with an invitation rather than a list of 'must-dos'.",
        "Leaves the 'mystery' of the deathbed vision somewhat open."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The final paragraph moves toward a slightly more 'sealed' rhetorical style.",
        "Could leave more room for the hearer to grapple with the 'dryness' before providing the 'Spirit' solution.",
        "The 'Submit to him' language can feel somewhat monovalent compared to the earlier polyphony."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A 'semi-open' work; it invites the hearer into a specific theological frame but respects the complexity of the journey."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are defined by a sophisticated narrative arc that successfully bridges the gap between high-culture skepticism and ancient prophecy. The preacher avoids a static three-point structure, opting instead for a 'homiletical plot' that moves from the 'siren call' of secularism to the 'rattling' of the valley. The integration of text and context is seamless, providing a genuine 'reframing' of modern despair. While the conclusion is theologically firm, the journey there is marked by an appreciation for mystery and the 'between' space of faith and doubt."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It explicitly rejects 'warm fuzzy' versions of the gospel and 'sentimental' deathbed scenes. The preacher takes the 'terrible thing' of sin and the 'cruel death' of cancer seriously, refusing to offer 'immediate comfort' without acknowledging the 'bad news.' The use of McInerney's mother—a woman who snaps at those calling her saintly—is a powerful anti-kitsch device. The sermon avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by grounding the hope not in human goodness but in the 'holy name' of God, which is a much more 'austere' and authentic aesthetic.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential kitsch of the deathbed vision is noted and 'held at arm's length' by the preacher's skepticism.",
      "The 'Jesus is the answer' bumper sticker mentality is explicitly critiqued."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The mother's sharp 'Don't say that' when told she has no reason to fear.",
      "The acknowledgment that 'wishful thinking never created a crucified savior.'"

    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'sober' aesthetic by continuing to contrast the 'dazzlement' of the Gospel with the 'gravity' of the human condition."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon creates a profound 'Space for Grace' by systematically dismantling the 'Space for Merit.' By emphasizing that God acts 'not for your sake... but for the sake of my holy name,' the preacher opens a vertical dimension that is entirely independent of human effort or 'righteous peace of mind.' The tension between the 'dry bones' and the 'breath' is sustained until the very end. The sermon respects the mystery of God's nature and refuses to 'explain away' the cross or the resurrection as mere symbols, thereby allowing the 'Holy' to happen in the encounter with the text.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'saintly' reputation and the 'terrible' secret is held effectively to show the need for grace.",
    "mystery_respected": "The preacher admits skepticism about near-death experiences but leaves room for God's 'unforeseen' revelation.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails completely; moralization is explicitly identified as the 'church's failure' in the case of Mrs. McInerney.",
    "recommendation": "The preacher could further open space by allowing the 'silence' of the dry bones to linger slightly longer before the 'rattling' begins."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.7,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'Reframing' and 'Stewardship of Language.' It operates with a high degree of intellectual and literary sophistication, making it particularly effective for an educated, perhaps skeptical, congregation. The preacher avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by refusing to sentimentalize death or simplify the Gospel into 'warm fuzzies.' Instead, the aesthetic power is found in the 'sober beauty' of God's sovereign grace. The structure is dynamic, following a narrative arc that moves from cultural critique to existential crisis to a Christological resolution. The language is precise, rhythmic, and evocative, successfully 'showing' the valley of bones before 'telling' the promise of the Spirit. While the conclusion is theologically traditional, the path taken to get there is marked by an 'openness' to the complexities of modern life and the 'strangeness' of the biblical witness.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Sophisticated integration of contemporary literature (McInerney) with ancient prophecy (Ezekiel).",
      "Absolute avoidance of religious kitsch and sentimentalism.",
      "Precise and evocative 'stewardship of language' that respects the hearer's intelligence."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The transition between the literary analysis and the biblical exposition could be more fluid.",
      "The conclusion could benefit from a slightly more 'open' rhetorical ending to match the intellectual openness of the introduction.",
      "Some secondary metaphors could be refreshed to match the originality of the overall sermon."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Literary-Reframing (Sober-Reformed with High-Culture Engagement)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Anti-Kitsch) and Paul Scott Wilson (Narrative/Imagery).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'urbane' hearers, intellectuals, and those weary of 'sentimental' religion; it respects the 'highbrow' while challenging it.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with even more 'sensory' descriptions of the contemporary 'valleys' we inhabit.",
      "Try an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer with the question 'Can these bones live?' to carry into the week.",
      "Continue to use 'secular' voices as a foil for the 'strangeness' of the Gospel."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An excellent sermon that demonstrates how the 'aesthetic turn' can strengthen rather than weaken the Reformed emphasis on the Word. By taking form and language seriously, the preacher makes the 'central myth' of the Gospel feel not like an 'outmoded notion,' but like the only reality capable of speaking to the 'terrible things' of human existence. It is a model of how to preach 'grace' without falling into 'kitsch.'"
