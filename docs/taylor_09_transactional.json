    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically supportive in its Nurturing Parent stance, offering comfort in times of crisis. However, it reinforces a dependency model where the listener is a perpetual child. The justification of suffering (the 'death angel' as a gift) can be psychologically burdensome, as it requires the 'Adapted Child' to suppress natural grief in favor of 'gratitude' for the trial.",

      "The switch to justifying death and suffering as 'gifts' can feel like a psychological 'trap' (ITHY)."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Incorporate more Adult-to-Adult transactions by asking the congregation how they personally experience the tension between 'security and risk' rather than defining it for them. Allow the 'Free Child' to grieve the 'death angel' without immediately forcing a 'solemn transaction' interpretation."
