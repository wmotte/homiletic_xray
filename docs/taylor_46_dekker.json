Feeding upon that diet, even Jesus Christ, our eternal health is certain."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses John 6:35 as a springboard rather than a specific anchor. It fails to identify what is unique to THIS text that cannot be found elsewhere. Instead, it drifts into general 'God language' and theophany (Horeb), losing the specific Johannine context of the Bread of Life discourse.",
      "quotes": [
        "I want today to deal with this passage, if I may, in the thirtyfifth verse of the sixth chapter of the Gospel of John",
        "And this language that he uses here is God language, I am."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Isolate the specific metaphor of 'Bread' as it relates to the manna tradition and the immediate hunger of the 5,000, rather than treating 'I AM' as a general dogmatic category."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Exegesis is largely absent. There is no mention of the original readers, the Johannine community, or the specific literary context of the Bread of Life discourse. The preacher uses 'theophany' as a buzzword but fails to provide actual historical-critical or linguistic depth.",
      "quotes": [
        "(I wanted to use that word so you would know I've been around the block a few times myself.)",
        "New Testament people and early church people were apparently forever casting about..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond anecdotal references to scholars (Sanders) and actually engage with the Greek text or the specific Jewish-Hellenistic context of the bread metaphor."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part but often borders on cultural commentary rather than textual application. It addresses the 'zeitgeist' (drugs, greed, television) as Dekker suggests, but sometimes loses the link to the specific Scripture passage.",
      "quotes": [
        "I was up far too late last night, watching Ted Koppel's forum on drugs.",
        "the two most enduring and... enjoyed television programs of this decade have been about sleaze and conspicuous consumption: Dynasty and Dallas."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the cultural critique of 'greed' and 'drugs' is explicitly fed by the 'Bread of Life' metaphor rather than standing as a separate social commentary."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured as a series of reflections and anecdotes rather than a movement where the hearer is 'expounded' through the text. The exposition is so thin that the application feels detached from the Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "You know our physical lives are so much parables of our spiritual lives...",
        "I have no doubt in my mind... that it is an accident that the two most enduring... programs..."

      "improvement_point": "Integrate the textual analysis of 'hunger' directly into the psychological analysis of modern 'junk diets' from the start."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is well-articulated as 'hunger' and 'failure.' Redemption is present as Christ the Bread. However, the 'gratitude' (sanctification/ethics) is somewhat lost in the polemic against greed.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are able to substitute all kinds of diets for that primal, that seminal hunger",
        "He gives meaning to life."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Clarify how the 'redemption' in Christ specifically transforms the 'misery' of the addict or the greedy person into a life of 'gratitude'."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on being 'lost in time' (societal decay) and 'eternal health.' It takes the hearer seriously but lacks the sharp 'narrow way' vs. 'broad way' urgency Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "...selling our souls sometimes to get hold of something that will soon turn to ashes in our hands.",
        "Uncertainty about destiny is why teenage suicide is so high..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the call to 'come' and 'believe' a more radical, existential choice with clear consequences for the 'life design'."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, and the 'I AM' is linked to His divinity (God the Son). The sermon emphasizes that man has no life in himself. However, it flirts with being a sermon about 'meaning' rather than Christ Himself.",
      "quotes": [
        "And not merely Son of God but God the Son",
        "Man has no life in himself, it is Christ who is his life."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more on the person of Christ as the 'Bread' and less on 'meaning' as a psychological category."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "At over 2,000 words, the sermon meets the length requirement for 'breadth.' However, much of this breadth is filled with anecdotes (Placido Domingo, Pittsburgh) rather than exegetical depth.",
      "quotes": [
        "I thank you for that kind introduction... [long anecdote about Placido Domingo]"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Replace the lengthy introductory anecdotes with deeper textual exposition to achieve true 'depth' through 'breadth'."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s ideal primarily due to a lack of rigorous exegesis and a failure to isolate the 'unique' word of the specific text. It relies heavily on anecdotal introductions and general psychological observations. While it effectively addresses the zeitgeist (greed, drugs, media), these applications often feel like social commentary rather than an 'actualization' of the written Word of God. The 'I AM' is treated as a dogmatic abstraction rather than being rooted in the specific Johannine narrative.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong awareness of the zeitgeist and cultural idols (greed, celebrity culture).",
      "Clear articulation of human misery as an 'inchoate longing' and 'hunger'.",
      "Adequate length to allow for rhetorical development."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Excessive use of non-theological anecdotes (the first 400 words are largely irrelevant to the text).",
      "Lack of original language engagement or historical-critical depth.",
      "Failure to explain why John 6:35 is distinct from other 'I AM' sayings or general calls to faith."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'speech about the gospel' and 'human meaning' more than it is a 'sermon' in Dekker's strict sense. It lacks the specific exegetical mounting required for the 'bicycle wheel' to turn properly. It is adequate as an inspirational talk but weak as a formal exposition and application of a specific Bible passage."
