    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, treating the congregation as capable, thinking subjects. By acknowledging the natural resistance to the message ('folks do not want to do it'), the preacher validates the listener's feelings rather than shaming them. The focus on 'neighborliness' promotes a healthy, autonomous community rather than a dependent or guilt-driven one.",
    "strengths": [

      "Effective use of the Adult ego state to process complex ethics.",
      "Validation of human resistance without resorting to Critical Parent shaming."

      "The 'must' language in section I could be softened to further invite the Free Child's creativity.",
      "Slight risk of 'Ain't It Awful' when describing the 'jungle of fear,' though it is used to motivate action."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use self-disclosure (like the pie safe story) to maintain an Adult-Adult connection and prevent the congregation from slipping into an Adapted Child (fearful/compliant) role."
