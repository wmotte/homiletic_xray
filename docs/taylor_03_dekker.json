(Revelation 3:20) Eternal God, known to us in countless ways and times without number [...] So seeing and so setting ourselves, the presence of God becomes our desired climate, and we live our days in his sight as if all he bids us see and seek is the fullness of the stature of Christ."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to actualize the specific text of Revelation 3:20. Instead of an exposition of the 'knocking' or the 'supping', the text serves as a mere springboard for a general discourse on the 'divine spark' in humanity. The preacher treats the Bible as a collection of general ideas rather than a specific, current proclamatory word.",
      "quotes": [
        "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock...",
        "That's strong language, saying that all people have some God in them, and yet it is exactly what the Bible says."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus exclusively on the specific imagery of Revelation 3:20—the invitation, the threshold, and the table fellowship—rather than drifting into Genesis 1 or the Prodigal Son."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 1,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of linguistic or historical-critical study. The original context of the Laodicean church (the 'lukewarm' state) is entirely absent. The preacher does not ask what the text meant for the first readers, violating Dekker's requirement for scholarly grounding.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Bible suggests, and said, 'Let us make man in our image...'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Examine the historical context of the letter to Laodicea and the specific Greek nuances of 'met' emou' (with me) to ground the sermon in the original revelation."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is largely based on general humanitarian optimism. While it mentions specific cultural markers (Atlanta, Langston Hughes), it lacks the 'true truth' of concrete spiritual or ethical demands. It leans toward a psychological 'self-esteem' boost rather than a specific application of the Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "The image of God may be marred in our society, but heaven be praised, it is carved deep in the thought and heart of America.",
        "That should make you stand up a little straighter."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move from general cultural optimism to concrete ethical or spiritual challenges that arise specifically from Christ knocking at the door of a self-satisfied life."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Because there is almost no exposition of the primary text, there is no movement between text and hearer. The hearer is not 'expounded' by the text but is instead flattered by a thematic speech about human dignity.",
      "quotes": [
        "There is some of God in each of us.",
        "This was the faith of Jesus. He believed that there resided enough of God in us..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Structure the sermon so that the specific details of the text (the knock, the voice) directly interpret the current situation of the hearer."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon acknowledges 'misery' (gullibility, unreliability) but quickly pivots to an inherent 'splendor' in man. This contradicts Dekker's view of misery before God. Redemption is presented more as 'realizing one's own worth' than as an act of Christ. It is too human-centered and insufficiently Trinitarian.",
      "quotes": [
        "You can't laugh or sneer people out of their greatness and goodness...",
        "There is something august and splendid and like God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the sense of misery by acknowledging that the door is closed from the inside, and emphasize that redemption is an external act of grace, not an internal discovery."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are absent. The sermon suggests an inevitable return to the 'father's house' based on inherent nature. There is no serious threat of being lost (temporal or eternal); the tone is one of universal potentiality rather than urgent decision.",
      "quotes": [
        "The power to respond was there.",
        "We shall find peace only when we claim it and live by its terms."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the gravity of the 'knock'—that the door might remain closed and the consequences of that choice."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned, but he is not the telos. He is presented as a 'believer' in human potential rather than the Lord who is the only source of life outside of man. The sermon points man back to himself (the 'God in us') rather than to salvation outside himself.",
      "quotes": [
        "This was the faith of Jesus. He believed that there resided enough of God in us...",
        "Whatever part of God is in anybody is not to be played with..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Reframe Christ not as one who affirms human goodness, but as the 'One Lord' who brings a grace that man does not possess in himself."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "At approximately 1150 words, the sermon would take about 11-12 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for theological depth. It remains at the level of a moralistic talk.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the sermon to at least 20 minutes by engaging in rigorous exegesis and a more complex application of the text to the zeitgeist."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria in almost every category. It lacks specific biblical exposition, fails the length requirement, and replaces the 'extra nos' of the Gospel with an 'in nobis' theology of inherent human divinity. It functions as a thematic speech on human dignity rather than a proclamation of the Word of God.",
    "strengths": [
      "Adequate use of contemporary cultural references (Langston Hughes, Stevenson) to engage the hearer's imagination.",
      "Clear, accessible language that avoids unnecessary jargon."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Theological anthropocentrism: The focus is on the 'God in us' rather than the 'God for us', which Dekker warns against.",
      "Lack of specific exegesis: The primary text (Rev 3:20) is ignored after the introduction.",
      "Insufficient length: The sermon is too short to achieve the necessary 'depth' through 'breadth'.",
      "Absence of the 'two ways': There is no sense of the urgency or the possibility of being lost."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This text cannot be classified as a sermon according to Dekker's definition. It is a moralistic speech about 'the image of God' that fails to recreate the specific Bible passage into a new, current, proclamatory word."
