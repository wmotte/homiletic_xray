      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's first thesis. It does not actualize one specific pericope but functions as a thematic lecture on the 'Lamb' motif across the whole Bible. It treats John 1:29 as a 'biblical keyword' rather than a specific text with a unique message found nowhere else.",
      "quotes": [
        "This text... is the sum of all Christian preaching.... My task... is but to repeat the same message",
        "The description of Jesus as the Lamb of God... is therefore a combination of the blood sacrifice for sin and the Passover Lamb"

      "improvement_point": "Restrict the focus to the specific narrative context of John 1. Avoid the 'encyclopedic' approach that pulls in Enoch, Exodus, and Isaiah as equal partners."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates the required academic background (Hebrew/Greek knowledge is implied through the use of 'ephapax' and 'mandatum'). The historical-religious context of Jewish apocalyptic literature and sacrificial systems is well-explained.",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Application is somewhat general. While it mentions Auschwitz and the sexual revolution, these function more as cultural illustrations than concrete applications to the specific congregation's spiritual life.",
      "quotes": [
        "The myth of human moral progress died in Auschwitz.",
        "A person of today, hearing the phrase 'Lamb of God,' thinks of nothing particular."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a lecture-style structure: first a historical-symbolic survey, then a theological conclusion. The hearer is an observer of information for the first two-thirds before being addressed.",
      "quotes": [
        "Here's what the people of John's time knew that we don't know today:",
        "Many people will want to know how all of this actually works."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The seriousness of being lost is present, particularly in the discussion of the 'angel of death' and the 'curse of sin'. However, the 'narrow way' as a life-design choice for the hearer is less developed than the objective state of being lost.",

      "findings": "Christ is undeniably the telos. The doctrine of the two natures is present ('Second Person of the Trinity'), and the sermon moves toward the 'Great Exchange' as the ultimate goal.",

      "findings": "At roughly 19.5 minutes, the sermon barely meets the 20-minute threshold. While it has breadth (covering many Bible books), it lacks the specific depth Dekker seeks because it remains too general/thematic.",

  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon functions more as a thematic biblical-theological lecture on the 'Lamb of God' than a sermon in Dekker's sense. It fails the primary requirement of being an exposition of a *specific* Bible passage, instead opting for a synthesis of various biblical motifs. However, it is theologically robust, avoiding sentimentality and maintaining a sharp focus on human misery and divine grace.",
    "strengths": [
      "Rigorous rejection of moralism and human progress.",
      "Strong Trinitarian and Christocentric focus.",
      "Effective use of biblical-theological categories (expiation, atonement)."

    "weaknesses": [
      "Thematic rather than pericope-driven.",
      "Structure is too didactic/informative, delaying the 'proclamatory' moment.",
      "Application remains somewhat abstract (Auschwitz, sexual revolution) rather than congregational."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate theological speech, but it is not yet a 'sermon' according to Dekker’s definition because it lacks the specificity of a single text and the interwoven nature of exposition and application."
