    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a recap of the Lenten journey, attempting to evoke the sensory experience of the passion narrative. However, it relies heavily on 'churchly' language rather than raw, relatable human experience. The identification with the 'dying thief' provides a moment of empathy, but the connection to the hearer's immediate life world is delayed until the middle of the text. It functions more as a 'religious experience' than a 'concrete life experience'.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This phase is strongly developed through the cultural critique of the 'twentieth-century man'. The preacher pauses to analyze the human condition, specifically the denial of sin versus the reality of its consequences. It moves from the 'what' of the crucifixion to the 'why' of human misery, exploring the problem of alienation from multiple angles (family, drugs, crime).",
      "quotes": [

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a solid theological framework by linking the 'Seven Last Words' to the wider scope of salvation history (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Zechariah). It formulates the 'big idea' that the cross is the 'fait accompli' of God's ancient intention. The exegesis is more thematic than technical, but it successfully builds a logical bridge between Old Testament prophecy and the 'It is finished' declaration.",

      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the preacher introduces the 'I must' as a principle for the hearer, the applications remain largely general ('must serve on, must forgive on'). There is an invitation to change, but it lacks specific, actionable steps for the coming week. The conclusion moves quickly back into visionary/poetic language about heaven, potentially bypassing the 'doing' in favor of 'feeling'.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of a 'Visionary-Declarative' approach that prioritizes theological depth and imaginative inspiration over practical application. It begins by situating the hearer within the liturgical narrative of Lent, effectively using 'Concrete Experience' to set the stage. The transition into 'Reflective Observation' via a critique of modern social misery is effective and provides a necessary bridge to the 'Abstract Conceptualization' of the atonement. The preacher demonstrates high skill in weaving Old Testament typology into the 'Seven Last Words', providing a robust intellectual framework for the 'Assimilating' learner. However, the sermon falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase. The transition from the cosmic victory of Christ to the daily duty of the believer ('I must') is logically sound but practically thin. The applications are general and lack the specificity required for 'Converging' learners to translate the message into concrete life-change. The language is consistently elevated and poetic, which serves the 'Diverging' learner well but may occasionally obscure the 'Pragmatic' tasks of the Christian life.",

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a well-crafted theological and poetic reflection that succeeds in providing a 'big picture' of the atonement. From a Kolb perspective, it is highly effective in the 'Abstract' and 'Reflective' phases, making it a strong resource for hearers who learn through logical connection and imaginative vision. However, its diagnostic weakness lies in the 'Active' phase. The preacher provides a beautiful map of the 'Father's house' but fewer instructions on how to walk the 'crooked and perilous way' in the immediate present. To move from a 6.5 to an 8, the sermon would need to bridge the gap between the 'cosmic must' of Christ and the 'concrete must' of the congregation with much greater specificity."
