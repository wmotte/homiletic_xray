    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This is a remarkably healthy sermon from a TA perspective. It avoids the common 'Bait and Switch' of religious rhetoric. The preacher uses her Adult ego state to process a traumatic social event, modeling for the congregation how to handle cognitive dissonance and grief without regressing into a fearful Adapted Child or a judgmental Critical Parent. By admitting her own 'sins, failures, and liabilities,' she levels the playing field, making the transaction Adult-to-Adult.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of transparency and vulnerability.",

    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Left Hand/Right Hand' metaphor is complex; ensure the 'Adult' processing doesn't become too abstract for the 'Child' to find hope.",
      "The transition from 'I don't like how God runs the world' to 'God is in control' is a sharp turn that requires careful Adult grounding."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements when discussing judgment. This prevents the 'Critical Parent' from becoming a 'Persecutor' and keeps the congregation in an 'Adult' reflective state."
