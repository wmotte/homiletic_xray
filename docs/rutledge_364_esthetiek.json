    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in imagery by bridging the gap between the literal and the metaphorical. Following Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell,' the preacher uses the Joy Williams story to establish a vivid, sterile laboratory setting that contrasts sharply with the 'stench' of reality. The imagery of the Susquehanna headwaters and the Nile explorers provides a concrete geographical anchor for the abstract concept of 'living water.' Most importantly, the sermon avoids 'dead metaphors' by grounding the thirst of Christ in the physical reality of a 'nameless migrant expiring alone in the desert.' This prevents the theological concept of the Passion from becoming a mere abstraction, forcing the hearer to visualize the parched throat of the Incarnate Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "The engineers within wore white uniforms and bootees on their shoes and gloves on their hands.",

        "The description of the crucifixion itself remains somewhat general ('prolonged agony'); more tactile details of the 'vinegar' or 'hyssop' could enhance the micro-aesthetics.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise and avoids the 'Canaanite' jargon that often plagues Passion sermons. The preacher exhibits 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre) by carefully unpacking the word 'metaphor' and its misuse. By distinguishing between 'factual reality' and 'symbolism,' the preacher respects the intelligence of the hearer. The use of the Flint, Michigan example is a precise application of 'loving language' that does justice to the victims of injustice. However, the tone occasionally shifts into a slightly academic register ('The Fourth Evangelist tells us', 'Christian interpreters have understood'), which, while clear, lacks the poetic economy of the opening section.",
      "quotes": [
        "Oh, they said, we thought that was just a metaphor.",
        "People with little political voice or agency were being poisoned by the local water.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a steady, rhythmic cadence, particularly in the opening and the concluding invitation. There is a discernible 'legato' in the reflective passages about the Samaritan woman and a 'staccato' urgency when addressing the congregation directly ('What is he doing there? Why do we come today?'). However, the middle section, which involves significant biblical cross-referencing (Galatians, Deuteronomy, Zechariah), feels more like 'paper language.' The flow is interrupted by the parenthetical citations and the explanatory tone. The ending regains musicality through the use of parallelism ('Come to his water. Come to his cross.'), creating a liturgical 'flow' that suits the Good Friday context.",
      "quotes": [
        "What is he doing there? Why do we come today?",

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "A mix; the frame is highly oral and engaging, but the 'meat' of the exegesis leans toward paper language."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon demonstrates a high level of micro-aesthetic awareness. By utilizing contemporary literature and sharp social analogies, it avoids the trap of 'religious jargon.' The imagery is the strongest suit, effectively 'reframing' the thirst of Christ through the lens of modern environmental and social crises. While the musicality suffers slightly in the exegetical middle, the overall stewardship of language is commendable, treating the hearer as a mature partner in interpretation."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with the Joy Williams story, which introduces the conflict between metaphor and reality. The movement proceeds from the Samaritan well to the Cross, and finally to the River of Life in Revelation. This creates a dynamic journey from 'thirst' to 'abundance.' The turning point is the realization that the 'living water' is not just a spiritual idea but is birthed from the physical agony of the Cross. However, the energy occasionally dips during the dense biblical citations in the middle, which feels more like a lecture than a narrative movement.",
      "quotes": [
        "What have you done to my water? The Lord asked. My living water...",
        "But we don’t understand this metaphor until his hour comes—his hour of being lifted up on the cross.",
        "There shall no more be anything accursed..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The 'metaphor vs. reality' tension is sustained throughout the sermon.",
        "The movement from the 'sterile lab' to the 'bloody cross' is a powerful dramaturgical shift.",
        "The conclusion provides a resolution that links back to the opening problem of thirst."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition between the Joy Williams story and the Samaritan woman could be tighter.",
        "The 'middle' contains too many disparate biblical references that slow the narrative momentum.",
        "The 'upsetting' of the hearer's expectations could be even sharper by lingering longer on the 'shame' of the cross."

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. The preacher practices 'reframing' (Cilliers) by placing the cry 'I thirst' within the context of the Flint water crisis and the plight of migrants. This is not a 'pasted-on' application but a deep aesthetic synthesis. The 'strangeness' of the biblical text (the curse of hanging on a tree) is respected, yet it is made startlingly relevant. The sermon offers a new frame: the environmental 'carelessness and greed' of humanity is seen as a continuation of the refusal to give Christ a cup of water. It moves beyond simple moralism into a profound theological ecology.",
      "quotes": [
        "If, in his incarnate life, Jesus had drunk the water in Flint, Michigan, he also would have been poisoned just like us.",
        "Jesus comes alongside the least and the lost of humanity.",
        "Intricate connection between actual water... and the living water of eternal life."

      "strengths": [
        "Organic integration of social justice and high Christology.",
        "The 'reframing' of the cross as the 'source' of the river of life is aesthetically satisfying.",
        "Honors the historical 'then' while speaking urgently to the 'now'."

        "Could further explore the 'resistance' (Stark) hearers might feel toward the environmental application.",
        "The connection to the 'communion cup' is mentioned briefly but could be more deeply integrated into the 'actual water' theme.",
        "Ensure the 'Flint' analogy doesn't overshadow the specific 'thirst' of the Crucified."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes, it successfully reframes the 'spiritual' thirst of John's Gospel as a deeply physical and social reality."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon functions as an 'open work of art' (Stark) by raising questions about the hearer's presence in the sanctuary ('I wonder what brought you off the streets...'). It acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' by mentioning the 'race that seems more than ever to be bent on destroying itself.' However, the conclusion leans toward a more traditional, 'closed' evangelical invitation. While the 'mystery' of the water and blood is respected, the theological explanations (quoting Schnackenburg and explaining the sacraments) occasionally 'seal' the meaning rather than leaving it for the hearer to inhabit. It is more 'monovalent' in its sacramental theology than 'polyvalent.'",
      "quotes": [
        "I wonder what brought you off the streets of the city into this sanctuary today.",
        "I wonder if there are some here who do not really understand what we are doing.",
        "Find for yourselves the gift of the love that will never fail."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The use of 'I wonder' creates an invitational space for the hearer.",
        "Acknowledges the difficulty of the Good Friday event ('more horribly than most of us dare to imagine').",
        "Leaves the 'mystery' of the water and blood as a 'stream of blessing' without over-explaining the mechanics."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The ending is a bit 'neat' and could benefit from an open-ended question that lingers.",
        "The theological 'layers of meaning' are presented as 'pointing to one truth,' which limits polyvalence.",
        "Allow more room for the 'silence' of the thirst before jumping to the 'river of life'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily a 'closed' work that uses 'open' rhetorical devices to engage the audience before delivering a specific theological message."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is well-conceived, moving from a contemporary 'parable' to a deep social and theological 'reframing' of the Passion. The narrative arc is strong, successfully linking the 'thirst' of the cross to both the 'thirst' of the world and the 'abundance' of the New Jerusalem. While the middle section is somewhat heavy with citations, the overall movement is purposeful and takes the hearer on a journey from sterile indifference to the 'wellspring' of grace."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'cheap comfort' by staring directly at the 'horrible' and 'shameful' nature of the crucifixion. By linking Christ's thirst to the Flint water crisis and dying migrants, it bypasses the 'pre-chewed emotions' of typical Passion sentimentality. It does not offer a 'happy ending' that ignores the 'pain of suffering.' The use of Joy Williams' dystopian story serves as a powerful anti-kitsch device, mocking the 'sterile' and 'metaphorical' distance we often keep from the Gospel. The emotion feels authentic because it is grounded in physical, vulnerable reality.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The phrase 'stream of blessing and salvation' (quoted) borders on clichéd liturgical language.",
      "The final 'love that will never fail' is a slightly predictable ending."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The comparison of Jesus to a 'nameless migrant expiring alone in the desert.'",
      "The admission that the preacher has never experienced 'extreme thirst,' acknowledging the limits of their own perspective."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the 'grit' of the physical analogies; avoid falling back on traditional liturgical phrases that can sound like 'clichés' to a modern ear."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened by the preacher's insistence on Christ's 'complete vulnerability.' By refusing to resolve the tension of the cross too quickly, the sermon allows the 'Holy' to happen in the space of human need. The 'reframing' of the cross as the source of the river of life opens a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) that is both ecological and soteriological. However, the space is slightly 'closed' by the heavy use of authoritative quotes and a somewhat prescriptive theological interpretation of the 'water and blood.'",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'literal thirst' and 'living water' is sustained effectively until the eschatological conclusion.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the Incarnation is respected by emphasizing that Jesus would have been 'poisoned just like us.'",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails, though the environmental application introduces a necessary ethical weight that avoids being 'moralistic.'",
    "recommendation": "Allow for more 'inter-esse' (the space between) by letting the biblical images speak for themselves without always providing a secondary scholarly quote."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a strong example of the 'aesthetic turn' in contemporary homiletics. It successfully navigates the tension between the 'Word' and 'Image' by using a modern literary parable to unlock a deep, sensory understanding of a familiar biblical text. The preacher avoids the 'kitsch' of sentimental piety by grounding the Passion in the harsh realities of modern social and environmental crises. The language is generally precise and 'stewardly,' though it occasionally retreats into a more academic, 'paper' style during the exegetical middle. The dramaturgy is effective, leading the hearer from the sterile indifference of a laboratory to the bloody reality of the cross, and finally to the crystalline hope of the New Jerusalem. It is a sermon that 'reframes' reality, forcing the hearer to see the 'living water' not as a safe metaphor, but as a life-and-death reality that flows from the very wounds of God.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Profound 'reframing' of the biblical text through contemporary social crises (Flint, migrants).",
      "Excellent use of contemporary literature (Joy Williams) to establish an aesthetic 'estrangement'.",
      "Authentic, non-kitsch approach to the physical suffering of Christ."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduce the density of academic/scholarly citations to improve oral rhythm.",
      "Create more 'openness' in the conclusion to allow for hearer appropriation.",
      "Prune the 'paper language' in the middle section to maintain the narrative arc's energy."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Reframing (combining literary imagery with social-ethical realism)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' model of Johan Cilliers and the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to an educated, socially conscious congregation that values both intellectual rigor and emotional authenticity.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'showing' the biblical scene even more vividly before introducing the modern analogy.",
      "Try an ending that leaves the 'thirst' as a lingering question rather than a resolved invitation.",
      "Focus on the 'musicality' of the exegetical sections to ensure they don't feel like 'interruptions' to the story."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust piece of homiletic work. It succeeds because it refuses to let the 'metaphor' of living water remain 'just a metaphor.' By forcing the literal and the spiritual into a collision, it creates a 'Space for Grace' that is both challenging and consoling. While it could benefit from more oral 'flow' in its middle sections and a more 'open' ending, it stands as a model for how to integrate contemporary culture and biblical depth without falling into kitsch or shallow moralism."
