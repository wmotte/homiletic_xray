    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's first thesis entirely. It is a thematic speech about 'reverence' rather than an exposition of one specific pericope. It jumps between various proof-texts (Timothy, Isaiah, Exodus, Revelation) to support a pre-conceived idea. It lacks the 'NOWHERE else' specificity Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "I want to speak of another quality... I refer to reverence",
        "The Bible tells us... in Isaiah 66:1",
        "In the prayer our Lord gave us... 'Our Father, hallowed be thy name'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one single pericope (e.g., Exodus 3:1-6 or Matthew 6:9) and allow that specific text to dictate the structure and unique content of the sermon."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is shallow and serves the theme. While the preacher mentions the Hebrew superlative (repetition), there is no rigorous engagement with the original context of the cited passages. It functions as a topical survey rather than scholarly exposition.",
      "quotes": [
        "They repeated 'holy' three times because the Hebrew language has no way to express the superlative except by repetition."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Engage with the historical and linguistic context of a single passage to uncover what it meant for the first readers before jumping to a general definition of reverence."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application is somewhat concrete regarding the 'zeitgeist' (vulgarity in movies, locker room talk), which Dekker values. However, it often slips into general moralizing about 'public filth' rather than a specific application derived from a text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Public filth in our recorded material and in our movies and in our books is looked upon with too much acceptance",
        "vulgarity is palmed off as art and gutter talk is described as honesty"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the critique of contemporary culture directly to the unique demands of a specific biblical text rather than general cultural grievances."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Because there is no central exposition, there is no true interwovenness. The sermon moves from a thematic definition to cultural critique, then to a string of biblical citations. The hearer is not 'drawn into the text' because there is no primary text to inhabit.",
      "quotes": [
        "I say all of this to raise the question...",
        "Notice, please, that I say the divine in this and that..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Structure the sermon so that the contemporary analysis and the biblical exposition are inseparable, moving through the text and the world simultaneously."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on misery (the loss of the sacred, vulgarity) and redemption (growth in Christ), but these are treated as psychological or moral states rather than the theological categories of the Catechism. The 'misery' is more about cultural decline than misery before God.",
      "quotes": [
        "we are in embarrassingly short supply [of reverence]",
        "we are not better off because of the loss"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by showing how irreverence is not just a social ill but a fundamental theological failure of the creature before the Creator."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon acknowledges the seriousness of the human condition and the necessity of appearing before God. It hints at the 'two ways' by suggesting that our attitudes toward the sacred have ultimate consequences for our 'full growth'.",
      "quotes": [
        "the God who has made us and before whom we must each one day appear",
        "anything done or said here which stunts our growth... is out of place"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'temporal loss' (missing one's calling/destination) more explicit as a consequence of the lack of reverence."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "While Christ is mentioned as the 'telos' at the beginning, the bulk of the sermon is Theocentric in a general sense. Christ becomes a means to an end (reverence) rather than the one in whom the 'Holy' becomes accessible. It borders on pan-en-theism, which Dekker might find risky.",
      "quotes": [
        "approach our God as we have known him in Christ",
        "full growth in Jesus Christ"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure Christ is not just the 'start' or 'end' but the specific lens through which the 'hallowing of the name' is achieved, avoiding general religious sentiment."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 14.5 minutes (1450 words), the sermon fails Dekker's 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for true 'depth'. The rapid-fire citation of verses prevents any single passage from being explored deeply.",
      "improvement_point": "Increase the length to at least 20 minutes by providing more rigorous exposition of a single passage and its specific implications."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon fails the primary formal requirement of Dekker's theses: it is not an exposition of a specific Bible passage but a topical address on 'reverence'. It lacks the necessary duration for depth and relies on a 'string of pearls' approach to Scripture. While it attempts a concrete critique of the zeitgeist, it remains too general and moralistic.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete cultural observation regarding the loss of the sacred in media and language",
      "Clear attempt to maintain a high view of God's transcendence (Theocentric focus)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of a single underlying pericope (Thesis 1.3)",
      "Insufficient duration to achieve theological depth (Thesis 8)",
      "Thematic/Topical structure rather than expository (Thesis 1)"
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "According to Dekker's criteria, this is not a sermon; it is a religious speech. It fails the formal definition of 'exposition and application of a specific Bible passage' and lacks the required breadth for depth."
