We, your clergy, must ponder them with the help of him who “holds both us and our words in his hand” [Ws 7:16], and then sow our gleanings [...] My brothers, we still need to examine how to practice justice and love mercy, and how each of us should be ready to walk with our Lord God. But, with the aid of heaven, we’ll treat of these matters with you some other day.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon lacks a contemporary 'hook' or specific modern life situations. However, it facilitates concrete experience through the psychological dramatization of the biblical characters' feelings. The hearer is invited to identify with the 'shaken man' of the Psalms. The concrete experience is primarily internal/emotional rather than external/situational.",

While there is a call to 'be good' and 'correct yourself', the sermon ends abruptly, explicitly deferring the 'how-to' of practicing justice and mercy to another day.

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of theological and psychological depth, focusing on the internal disposition of the believer. It fails, however, to complete the learning cycle by omitting concrete application. The preacher successfully takes the hearer through a process of reflecting on the 'problem' of injustice and providing a robust theological framework (Abstract Conceptualization) to reframe that problem. The use of the 'Sanctuary' as a visionary metaphor is effective. However, by explicitly deferring the 'how-to' of justice and mercy to a later date, the sermon leaves the 'Active Experimentation' phase empty. This results in a sermon that is intellectually and spiritually stimulating but practically stalled. It serves the 'Assimilating' learner well but neglects the 'Converging' learner who seeks immediate utility.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon provides a high-quality theological diagnosis of the human heart but lacks a prescription for action. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'half-cycle' sermon. It successfully moves the hearer from feeling (envy) to thinking (theology of judgment), but fails to move them to doing. The priority for improvement is the integration of the Pragmatic quadrant. While the preacher's role as 'Advocate' and 'Sage' is well-executed, the role of 'Guide/Coach' is missing. The sermon is effective for spiritual formation of the mind, but incomplete for the ethical mobilization of the person."
