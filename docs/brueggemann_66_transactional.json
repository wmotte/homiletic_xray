    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in homiletics. By addressing the listeners as fellow theologians (Adult), the preacher bypasses the typical Parent-Child dynamic of the pulpit. The use of the 'Vulture' metaphor is a brilliant 'Crossed Transaction' intended to break the listener out of a 'pious' Adapted Child state and into a reality-testing Adult state. The emphasis on community support prevents the 'disruption' from becoming traumatic, instead framing it as a shared path toward autonomy and new identity.",
    "strengths": [
      "Empowers the listener as an active 'theologian'.",
      "Deconstructs moralistic Parent-Child dynamics.",
      "Uses provocative imagery to stimulate Adult reflection rather than Child fear."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'vulture' imagery is high-intensity; ensure the Nurturing Parent 'safety net' is clearly felt by more sensitive listeners."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'We' language to maintain the Adult-Adult peer relationship. Keep the focus on the 'Here-and-Now' of the community's experience."
