    "sermon_start_end": "We’ve been looking in these weeks after Easter at what it means to live the Christian life in the books of 1 and 2 Peter. Today we again come to one of those themes that is crucial to understand what it means to live a Christian life. [...] The whole world has become the place of the glory of God, which means the building block that was rejected became the cornerstone of a whole new world. Don’t you want to be part of that? I do. Let us pray.",
    "notes": "The sermon follows a classic expository structure with a strong emphasis on biblical theology and corporate identity."

  "aristotelian_modes_analysis": {
    "logos": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The Logos is the strongest element of this sermon. The preacher employs a highly structured, deductive approach, clearly outlining three headings at the start: what we are called to be, what we are called to do, and how we are enabled. This 'rational architecture' is supported by a robust biblical-theological framework that traces the theme of 'God's presence' from Eden through the Tabernacle and Prophets to Christ. The logic is internally consistent; the transition from the theological reality of being 'living stones' to the practical necessity of 'lay ministry' (output) follows a clear causal path. The use of 'input and output' as a biological metaphor provides a rational bridge for the congregation to understand spiritual health.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let’s break that down. I want to unpack that. Let’s do it under these three headings: what we are called to be, what we’re called to do, and how we can be enabled and empowered to do it.",
        "Let me give you a summary of the entire storyline of the Bible in terms of one theme: the presence of God.",
        "There is input and there is output. Let’s talk about the human body. You need input... Same thing spiritually."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Exceptional clarity of structure through the three-point outline.",
        "Strong use of biblical-theological synthesis (linking Eden, Sinai, and the New Covenant).",
        "Effective use of logical analogies (the cornerstone's geometry, biological input/output)."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition between the 'temple' theology and the specific 'Redeemer church' transition could be more logically tightened.",
        "The section on 'being a priest' relies heavily on a specific interpretation of Hebrews 13 that could use more explicit exegetical defense.",
        "The 'how' section (point 3) shifts from corporate logic to individual identity logic somewhat abruptly."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The sermon excels in 'Theological Logos'—creating a coherent, traceable narrative of salvation history that leads to a specific congregational application."
    },
    "pathos": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The Pathos is functional but secondary. The sermon aims for 'head-pathos'—an intellectual appreciation of the glory of God—rather than a visceral emotional experience. While the preacher uses sensory language (the shekinah glory, the smell of the medicine), the tone remains largely didactic and instructional. The emotional appeal is strongest when discussing the 'rejection' of Christ and the 'preciousness' of the medicine, but it lacks the 'slices of life' that evoke deep empathy or recognition of the hearer's immediate emotional struggles. The appeal to join the 'new world' at the end is visionary but lacks a sharp emotional hook.",
      "emotional_tone": "Instructional and Visionary",
      "quotes": [
        "Can you imagine the joy and the love of knowing the infinitely holy and happy God face-to-face?",
        "Imagine that you get word that you’re dying and your family is around you... then someone comes in and says they just discovered a medicine.",
        "There are some hands that pretty much only you can hold and comfort."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of the 'medicine' illustration to explain the concept of 'preciousness'.",
        "Visionary language regarding the 'whole new world' at the conclusion.",
        "Gentle use of 'imagine' to invite the hearer into the biblical narrative."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The sermon remains largely cognitive; it needs more concrete, recognizable human stories to bridge the gap to the heart.",
        "The 'rejection' of Christ is stated as a fact but not painted with enough emotional depth to make the hearer feel the weight of it.",
        "The tone is somewhat monotonous in its instructional nature, lacking variation between 'seriousness' and 'comfort'."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Pathos is underdeveloped; the sermon informs the mind about the glory of God but does not consistently make the hearer *feel* the weight of that glory or the urgency of their vocation."
    },
    "ethos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The Ethos is established through intellectual authority and a sense of 'witnessing' to the tradition (citing Lloyd-Jones, Spurgeon, Tolkien). The preacher positions himself as a 'specialist' but acknowledges his own limitations (being 'quite a white guy'). However, there is a lack of deep personal vulnerability. The preacher speaks more as a 'Master/Teacher' than a 'Fellow Traveler'. His credibility comes from his exegetical precision and his clear commitment to the church's mission, but he remains somewhat distant from the personal struggles he mentions (e.g., being an 'abused child').",
      "authenticity": "The preacher is transparent about his influences and his role, but maintains a professional distance from personal struggle.",
      "quotes": [
        "I’m very grateful. In fact, you ought to be pretty grateful, because, to a great degree, my preaching is a result of listening to hundreds of recordings of David Martyn Lloyd-Jones.",
        "When I become a Christian, I don’t stop being white. I’m still quite a white guy, as many of you have often reminded me.",
        "I’m confessing with my lips Jesus’ name... I’m doing it right now. In other words, it’s my job. I’m a specialist."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Intellectual integrity shown through the acknowledgment of sources (Lloyd-Jones, Spurgeon).",
        "Humility in acknowledging the 'show' of the church's past and the need for a new model.",
        "Clear alignment between the messenger's role (preacher/specialist) and the message."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Increase personal vulnerability; the preacher mentions 'sin' and 'wounds' in the abstract but rarely in the first person.",
        "The 'specialist' vs 'generalist' distinction, while logically sound, risks creating a distance that undermines the 'priesthood of all believers' Ethos.",
        "Avoid the 'ivory tower' feel by connecting the theological heights more directly to the preacher's own daily struggle to be a 'living stone'."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Ethos is based on 'Authority as Teacher' rather than 'Authority as Witness'. It is credible but lacks the warmth of shared vulnerability."

  "rhetorical_balance_analysis": {
    "dominant_mode": "Logos",
    "suppressed_mode": "Pathos",
    "balance_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward Logos. The preacher is clearly more comfortable with systematic explanation and biblical theology than with emotional resonance or personal disclosure. The Ethos supports the Logos by providing an authoritative, well-read voice. However, the lack of Pathos creates a 'lecture-like' atmosphere where the congregation is given a brilliant map (Logos) but may lack the emotional fuel (Pathos) to begin the journey. The three modes do not reinforce each other equally; the Logos does the heavy lifting while Pathos and Ethos follow at a distance.",
    "consequences_of_imbalance": [
      "Intellectual hearers will be highly satisfied, but those seeking emotional comfort or existential connection may feel left out.",
      "The call to 'output' (ministry) may be understood as a duty (Logos) rather than a passionate response to grace (Pathos).",
      "The preacher risks being perceived as a 'theological professor' rather than a 'pastor'."
    ],
    "recommendation_for_balance": "To improve balance, the preacher should reduce the time spent on the historical-theological survey (Logos) and increase the use of 'slices of life'—concrete, emotional stories that illustrate the struggle and joy of being a 'living stone' in the city."

    "orthodoxy_logos": {
      "score": 9,
      "analysis": "The sermon is doctrinally rich and deeply rooted in a Reformed understanding of the 'priesthood of all believers' and Christology."
    },
    "orthopathy_pathos": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "While the sermon points toward right affections (valuing Christ as precious), it does not effectively 'awaken' them through its rhetorical delivery."
    },
    "orthopraxy_ethos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher models the 'output' he calls for by his own diligent study and preaching, showing a life dedicated to the 'confession of the name'."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_rhetorical_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of 'Rational-Declarative' preaching. It provides a masterful synthesis of biblical themes, moving from the Garden of Eden to the New Jerusalem to explain the concept of 'living stones.' Its greatest strength lies in its Logos—the clarity of its three-point structure and the logical force of its biological and architectural analogies. However, the sermon suffers from a 'coldness' typical of highly cognitive preaching. The Pathos is largely restricted to a single extended illustration (the medicine), and the Ethos is that of a distant, albeit brilliant, teacher. While the sermon is intellectually stimulating and doctrinally sound, it lacks the affective power to move the heart deeply. It informs the congregation of their identity but may not inspire the 'output' it demands because the emotional bridge remains under-constructed.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Traceable and coherent biblical-theological narrative.",
      "Effective use of the 'input/output' analogy for spiritual health.",
      "Clear, deductive structure that makes the sermon easy to follow and remember."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Inject more concrete, human-interest stories to strengthen Pathos.",
      "Increase personal vulnerability to move from 'Teacher' to 'Witness' Ethos.",
      "Shorten the historical survey to allow more time for the 'How' (Point 3) and its emotional application."
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Rational-Declarative",
    "audience_analysis": "Most appealing to educated, urban professionals who value intellectual rigor and systematic thought.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Start with a 'slice of life' story rather than a theological premise.",
      "Use more 'I' statements regarding struggle and 'You' statements regarding emotional resonance.",
      "Vary the vocal tone to match the emotional weight of 'rejection' vs 'glory'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This is a 'good' sermon (6.5/10) that excels in teaching but falls short in touching. It is a model of Logos-driven exposition, providing the congregation with a clear theological map of their vocation. However, to reach the level of an '8' or '9', it must balance this intellectual weight with the warmth of Pathos and the vulnerability of Ethos. As it stands, it is a highly effective lecture delivered from a pulpit."
