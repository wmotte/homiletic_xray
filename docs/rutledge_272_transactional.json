It moves from an Adult exploration of text to a Critical Parent warning against the 'religious smorgasbord.' While it promotes 'courage,' it defines that courage as adherence to a specific tradition, which can limit the Free Child's exploration of faith.",

      "The 'us vs. them' rhetoric regarding the secular world can foster anxiety.",
      "The dismissal of other spiritualities (crystals, Tarot) as 'novelty' is a Critical Parent shortcut that avoids Adult dialogue."

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the 'secular scorn' from an Adult position of curiosity rather than a Parent position of defense. Instead of 'Ain't it Awful,' explore how the 'Free Child' of the believer can interact joyfully with a world that doesn't understand them."
