The idea is a familiar one; the child never thought of putting beans in his ears until he was forbidden to do it. Then, of course, he was immediately seized [...] Dear people of God and heirs of the Covenant, do not fail to receive this mercy into your heart today, with joy. Amen."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon identifies the specific passage as 'crucial' and centers on the concept of the New Covenant. However, it relies heavily on Paul's interpretation (Romans 7) rather than mining what is unique to Jeremiah's voice. The 'nowhere else' quality is slightly diluted by general biblical theology.",
      "quotes": [
        "The lesson from Jeremiah today is one of the most crucial passages of all.",
        "What is the difference between the Old Covenant and the new one? Just this: the new one will be written in our hearts."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more on the specific imagery of Jeremiah—the 'taking by the hand' and the 'not teaching one another'—to find the unique prophetic nuance of this text versus the Pauline echo."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates clear knowledge of the historical context, specifically the Babylonian exile and the theological crisis of the exiles. This provides a solid foundation for the exposition.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jeremiah was one of the two great prophets... who lived through the Babylonian invasion and exile.",
        "They were faced with two unacceptable theological alternatives: Either God was too weak... or he had cast them aside permanently."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "While the history is strong, the linguistic depth (Hebrew nuances of 'berit' or 'torah') is absent, which Dekker suggests is necessary for full exposition."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "The application is exceptionally concrete, moving beyond generalities to specific, painful examples of racial violence and forgiveness. It avoids 'cheap' application by addressing the zeitgeist of racial division.",
      "quotes": [
        "The white woman was a member in the church of my childhood... Her teenage son was killed by a car full of intoxicated joyriding black youths.",
        "Her son was Michael Griffith, attacked for no good reason ten years ago in Howard Beach."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application doesn't just become 'moral examples' but remains tied to the supernatural 'writing on the heart' mentioned in the text."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a somewhat traditional 'block' structure: introduction, historical context, theological explanation, and then contemporary stories. The movement is logical but lacks the 'mixed' quality Dekker advocates.",
      "quotes": [
        "This brings us up to date in our Lenten series...",
        "Here are two stories about two Christian women..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Integrate the contemporary stories of the two women directly into the verse-by-verse exposition of Jeremiah 31 to show the text 'expounding' the hearer."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon strongly emphasizes 'misery' (the incapacity of the will) and 'redemption' (divine intervention). Gratitude is present in the concluding call to receive mercy with joy.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are in a bad fix before God. Our story is one of prolonged and habitual disobedience.",
        "It has to be done by divine intervention. Something has to work upon us from beyond ourselves."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'gratitude' section by showing how the 'new heart' specifically produces a life of service, not just internal peace."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on being 'lost' through the image of the Babylonian exile as an 'impasse' and 'shipwreck,' but the eternal dimension of the 'two ways' is muted.",
      "quotes": [
        "...the story of Israel, which is the story of us all, tells of a people who have 'suffered shipwreck on God and his commandments.'",
        "That is what the Babylonian exile means; we are at an impasse."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly address the consequence of remaining in the 'old' heart—the reality of being lost—to heighten the urgency of the New Covenant."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is the clear telos, especially in the connection to the Last Supper and Gethsemane. The doctrine of grace is central: salvation is 'not their own doing.'",
      "quotes": [
        "In Jesus, the Son of God, the New Covenant is fulfilled.",
        "Our disobedience becomes his burden to carry... The Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Strengthen the link between the 'Law written on the heart' and the Person of Christ as the living Torah."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 1750 words, the sermon likely clocks in under 20 minutes (approx. 17-18 mins). According to Dekker, it lacks the 'breadth' required for true depth.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section or the theological implications of the 'new heart' to exceed the 20-minute threshold."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of biblical preaching that takes the human condition seriously, yet it falls short of Dekker's formal requirements regarding length and the interwoven nature of exposition. It excels in concrete application but leans heavily on Pauline theology to explain a Jeremianic text.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete and courageous application regarding racial reconciliation.",
      "Clear articulation of human 'misery' as the incapacity of the will.",
      "Strong Christological focus in the conclusion."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (under 20 minutes) to achieve required depth.",
      "Block-style structure separates exposition from application.",
      "Over-reliance on Romans 7 at the expense of Jeremiah's unique prophetic voice."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate and theologically sound sermon, but it does not yet reach the 'ideal' defined by Dekker. It lacks the necessary breadth (duration) and the seamless integration of text and contemporary reality."
