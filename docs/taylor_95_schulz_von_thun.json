  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The factual content centers on the transition from the Upper Room (liturgy/piety) to the Mount of Olives (struggle/reality). The preacher utilizes a Barthian-adjacent 'Sache'—the cross of Calvary—as a historical and metaphysical turning point. However, the exegetical depth is secondary to the thematic application. The 'blue' side serves as a scaffold for the social-ethical argument. While the references to John and Matthew are clear, the sermon moves quickly from textual observation to systematic interpretation. The theological 'Sache' is the non-ultimacy of material power, which is presented as a dogmatic fact rather than an open question. It is comprehensible but leans heavily on the 'timelessness' of the Gospel to bridge the gap between 1st-century Jerusalem and 20th-century America.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a persona of 'Prophetic Solidarity'. There is a clear 'leakage' of lived experience regarding the Civil Rights struggle, particularly the mention of police vans and jail cells. This is not mere image management; it is a diaconal self-revelation where the preacher's suffering validates the message of the cross. The 'I' is not used for self-aggrandizement but as a witness to the 'timeliness' of the Gospel. There is a palpable sense of urgency and controlled indignation regarding the 'Hayes-Tilden decision' and the 'lynch rope', showing a preacher who is existentially entangled with the Word.",

        "I have ridden in police vans with them. I have been detained in jail cells with them, more than once.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Solidary Challenge'. The preacher uses 'we' and 'us' frequently, placing himself under the same judgment as the congregation ('We had better learn that lesson, and quickly!'). However, there is a clear authoritative 'from above' signal when addressing the nation's 'arrogance'. The relationship is not one of 'non-committal warmth' but of a leader calling a movement to order. The 'yellow' signal is: 'We are in this together, but we are currently failing our calling.' There is a risk of 'relationship noise' for those who identify strongly with the 'respectability' the preacher critiques.",

        "We had best learn this is our country.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The appeal is high-intensity but complex. It is not a simple moralistic 'do this', but a 'be this'. The preacher demands a shift in allegiance from material power to the Spirit. However, the 'Anspruch' (demand) heavily outweighs the 'Zuspruch' (promise) in the middle section. The Gospel is presented as a 'standard of judgment' and a 'mighty thrust' that the listener must join. The risk of moralism is mitigated by the Barthian emphasis that God is the one acting ('divine conspiracy'), yet the pressure on the 'dutiful listener' to be 'valiant' is significant. The 'Red' side is a call to 'overcome' through non-yielding of the heart.",
      "quotes": [
        "We had better learn that lesson, and quickly!",
        "Imbue thy people with thy power that we might go forth to the things that thou would have us to do.",

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The promise is the 'victory of Calvary', but it is immediately converted into a demand for social courage. The 'Gift' is the 'New Being', but the 'Task' dominates the rhetoric.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Moderate to High. The listener may feel that their faith is only valid if they are 'marching' or 'protesting'.",

        "The appeal is rooted in a cosmic victory (Calvary), not just human effort.",
        "Inspires action through a sense of historical destiny."

        "The 'Zuspruch' of personal forgiveness and rest is almost entirely absent, swallowed by the 'Anspruch' of social justice.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a powerful example of 'Kerygmatic Activism'. Theologically, it follows the line of Immink and Barth by treating the 'Deed at Calvary' as an objective act of God that reorders the world. Psychologically, it utilizes high-stakes 'Green' (Self-Revelation) to bridge the gap between the biblical text and the 1960s American context. The preacher successfully avoids 'Schizoid' detachment, but leans heavily into a 'Hysterical' (in the psychological sense) grand narrative that might leave the 'Depressive' or 'Compulsive' listener feeling overwhelmed by the scale of the demand. The 'Yellow' side is strong and solidary, though the 'Red' side (Appeal) borders on a new Law—the law of the 'valiant coalition'. The sermon's greatest strength is its congruence; the preacher is clearly 'all in'. Its greatest weakness is the relative lack of 'Zuspruch' for the individual soul's interior life, as the 'timeless' Gospel is made so 'timely' that it risks becoming a political manifesto.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a slight risk of 'secularizing' the Spirit by equating the 'mighty thrust of God' directly with political movements, though the preacher attempts to maintain God as the 'Acting Subject'.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Exceptional rhetorical use of the 'Upper Room vs. Mount of Olives' metaphor.",
      "Authentic, diaconal self-revelation that empowers the message.",
      "Powerful synthesis of hymnody (Tindley) and theology (Tillich)."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Increase the 'Blue' (factual/exegetical) depth of the Matthew text itself.",
      "Balance the 'Anspruch' (demand) with more personal 'Zuspruch' (grace/rest).",
      "Soften the 'Yellow' signals of 'We had better learn' to avoid triggering defensive reception."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, congruent, and prophetic sermon that communicates with high integrity, though it demands much from the listener's 'Appeal Ear'."
