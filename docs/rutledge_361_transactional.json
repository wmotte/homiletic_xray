    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, providing historical context and logical deconstruction of religious fantasies. It avoids the common 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' (ITHY) game by refusing to offer simplistic, magical solutions to the problem of death. Instead, it invites the listener into an Adult-Adult reflection on the nature of presence and trust. The use of personal narrative (the grandmother) is integrated as a source of Free Child joy and Nurturing Parent warmth without becoming 'smothering' or manipulative.",
    "strengths": [

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The term 'wretch' carries a high risk of triggering the Adapted Child (shame), even if intended theologically.",
      "Could further empower the Adult by asking more open-ended questions about the 'kingdom' in the here-and-now."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' and 'us' when discussing human frailty to maintain the Adult-Adult level and prevent the 'Persecutor' role from emerging."
