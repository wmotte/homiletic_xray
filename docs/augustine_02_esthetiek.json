    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes concrete, spatial imagery to ground abstract theological concepts of the indwelling Spirit. Augustine employs the metaphor of the 'temple' and the 'room' with psychological precision. By contrasting the 'conjugal bed' with a 'dark corner' and 'wallowing in the mire,' he creates a sensory landscape of shame and holiness. The imagery of the body as 'members of Christ' is not merely metaphorical but organic, forcing the hearer to visualize a physical connection between their actions and the person of Jesus. However, some images remain repetitive (the 'fire' of hell), leaning on established biblical tropes rather than fresh invention, though they remain effective for the oral context.",
      "quotes": [
        "So you choose some dark corner in your house to wallow in the mire.",
        "Your spirit will continue to dwell in him... as your dust lies sleeping beneath even more dust.",

        "The imagery of 'eternal flames' is somewhat conventional and could benefit from more specific sensory detail to avoid cliché.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strong 'showing' in the descriptions of human fear and domestic spaces, but shifts to 'telling' when discussing the mechanics of the soul's life principle."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Augustine exhibits masterful stewardship of language through dialectical precision. He carefully distinguishes between 'servile fear' and 'chaste fear,' a nuance that prevents the sermon from becoming a flat moralistic harangue. His word choice is economical yet rhetorically charged, avoiding unnecessary 'Canaanite' jargon in favor of clear, logical progressions. The precision with which he defines the 'life of the life of the body' demonstrates a high level of linguistic care. He treats words as instruments of surgical clarity, particularly when dissecting the motivations of the heart.",
      "quotes": [
        "Bodily death consists in casting away the soul... doesn’t the soul when dying also cast away what makes it live?",
        "It’s the letter threatening you, not yet grace strengthening you.",

        "The philosophical digression on the soul as the 'life principle' may be too abstract for a general audience.",

        "The term 'mire' is effective but used as a standard shorthand for sin."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Theological terms like 'Gehenna' and 'Tartarus' are used, but the core concepts (Grace, Spirit, Soul) are explained through relational analogies."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The text exhibits the rhythmic qualities of oral delivery, characteristic of Augustine's style. There is a clear use of parallelism and antithesis ('afraid of dying momentarily, but not of dying eternally'). The sentence structure varies between short, staccato commands ('Wait a minute. Come back here.') and longer, flowing reflections on divine love. This creates a natural 'flow' that sustains attention. The use of the second person ('You') creates a percussive, direct engagement. While the translation may lose some of the Latin's original assonance, the rhetorical cadence remains palpable.",
      "quotes": [
        "We’re afraid of prison, but not of Gehenna? We’re afraid of torturers, but not of the demons in hell?",
        "Hurry, hurry! Help him! This is a matter of life and death!",
        "The deeper love enters, the sooner fear leaves."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent use of rhetorical questions to create a rhythmic dialogue with the hearer.",
        "Strong use of antithesis to highlight the absurdity of human priorities.",
        "The 'Hurry, hurry!' passage captures the frantic pace of human anxiety."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Some sections in §11-12 become slightly more 'paper-like' and less rhythmic.",
        "The repetitive use of 'fear' in §8, while intentional, risks becoming monotonous.",
        "Could benefit from more varied alliteration to enhance memorability."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Distinctly oral language; the text is designed for performance and direct address."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is rhetorically sophisticated yet accessible, embodying the 'sermo humilis'. It excels in precision, particularly in the psychological mapping of fear and love. The imagery is grounded in the domestic and the physical, making the 'temple' of the body a palpable reality. While it occasionally leans on traditional metaphors of fire and mire, the dialectical movement and rhythmic antitheses ensure the language remains active and engaging. It is a high-level example of language stewardship where form (the dialogue) serves the content (the internal struggle of the believer)."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'problem-solution' arc but lacks a singular narrative plot. It functions more as a series of escalating dramatized scenes: the courtroom of the heart, the deathbed, and the lover's quarrel. The 'upsetting of equilibrium' occurs early with the challenge to the body's sanctity. The movement from 'servile fear' to 'chaste love' provides a thematic progression, but the structure feels somewhat episodic. The energy is sustained through direct confrontation rather than a unfolding story. The conclusion is a soft landing, encouraging a minimum standard of behavior rather than a climactic resolution.",
      "quotes": [
        "What are you about to do? Come back here. What are you rushing into?",
        "I’ve just said what you should fear. I’ve also said what you should seek.",
        "May the example they set motivate husbands and wives to avoid adultery at least."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong, confrontational opening that immediately raises the stakes.",
        "Clear thematic transition from the 'fear of punishment' to the 'beauty of love'.",
        "Effective use of 'imaginary interlocutors' to create a sense of movement."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition between the discussion of hell (§4) and the soul's life principle (§6) is structurally jarring.",
        "The ending feels slightly anti-climactic compared to the intensity of the middle sections.",
        "The structure is more of a 'spiral' than a 'journey', revisiting the same points."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey of the soul, though structured as a series of rhetorical 'scenes' rather than a linear narrative."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Augustine masterfully 'reframes' the contemporary reality of sexual license through the lens of Pauline theology. He takes the common social reality (adultery, fear of prison, vanity in dress) and places it within the 'frame' of the Body of Christ. The integration is organic; he doesn't just quote 1 Corinthians, he inhabits it. The 'reframing' of the body as a 'temple' more honorable than a 'wife's bedroom' is a radical aesthetic shift for his audience. He respects the 'strangeness' of the text while making it painfully relevant to the hearer's daily anxieties about death and social standing.",
      "quotes": [
        "You respect your wife’s bed, but disrespect God’s temple.",
        "He can’t kill your soul... but you can... with your tongue.",
        "If a married woman must think about earthly matters... one who isn’t married is free to think about God."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant synthesis of the biblical 'temple' concept with everyday domestic life.",
        "Successful 'reframing' of fear: shifting it from temporal threats to eternal loss.",
        "The application flows naturally from the ontological status of the body as 'member of Christ'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection to the Psalm 34 text in §2 feels slightly more 'forced' than the Pauline integration.",
        "Could further explore the 'reframing' of the 'slut' / 'wanton' beyond the social stereotype of the time.",
        "The jump to 'virgins' in the final sections feels like a secondary context being introduced."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing; the sermon consistently offers a new lens (the 'optics of grace') to view the physical body."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Aesthetically, the sermon leans toward 'closedness' due to its pedagogical and corrective nature. While Augustine uses the 'open work' technique of asking the hearer to 'examine yourself sincerely,' the answers are largely predetermined by the dogmatic framework. There is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' regarding sexual struggle; it is framed as a binary choice between the 'eternal flames' and the 'eternal kingdom.' However, the 'openness' lies in the invitation to move from fear to love—a psychological process that remains open for the hearer to inhabit. The ending is prescriptive, leaving little room for polyvalence.",
      "quotes": [
        "Examine yourself, examine yourself sincerely. Well, would you commit it?",
        "Decide where you want to live—decide now, while you can still change your ways.",
        "If you recognize yourself in what I’ve been saying, decide..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The internal dialogue allows the hearer to participate in the 'tasting' of their own motivations.",
        "The distinction between types of fear leaves some room for the hearer's spiritual stage.",
        "The use of 'counsel' vs 'command' acknowledges different paths."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The binary of 'two dwelling places' (§4) closes down the complexity of human struggle.",
        "The moralistic ending ('do at least what is commanded') shuts the door on the 'openness' of the earlier sections.",
        "Could allow for more 'mystery' regarding the soul's journey."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent and 'closed'; it functions as a corrective 'mirror' rather than an 'open work of art'."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is rhetorically dynamic, utilizing a series of dramatized confrontations to move the hearer from external fear to internal love. It excels in 'reframing' the body's significance, successfully integrating the Pauline text into the domestic and social context of the audience. However, the macro-aesthetics suffer from a somewhat episodic progression and a 'closed' moralistic conclusion. The sermon acts as a powerful 'performance' of pastoral correction, but it leaves little room for the hearer to interpret the gospel outside of the preacher's strict binary framework."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. Augustine avoids 'cheap comfort' and 'pre-chewed emotions.' Instead of offering a 'happy ending' to the struggle with the flesh, he intensifies the tension by discussing the 'undying fire' and the 'fury' of God's gaze. He distinguishes between 'sentiment' (the libertine's superficial love) and 'authentic emotion' (the chaste fear of a child). There is no 'kitsch' here because the pain of sin and the reality of death are taken with absolute seriousness. The sermon does not 'beautify' the message; it presents the 'sober beauty' of a soul in order.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential for kitsch in the 'virgins' section is avoided by focusing on 'inner graciousness' rather than sentimental piety.",
      "The description of the 'libertine' could have been a cliché, but Augustine gives it psychological weight."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the man panicking over his assets and prison, contrasted with his indifference to his soul.",
      "The distinction between fearing the 'whip' and fearing to 'grieve the Father'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of psychological realism; avoid the slightly repetitive 'fire' imagery to ensure the 'anti-kitsch' quality remains high."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon creates 'space for grace' primarily through the concept of 'reframing'—opening a window into the 'land of the living.' However, this space is frequently narrowed by heavy moralization and the 'bridle' of fear. While Augustine explicitly mentions that 'grace strengthens you,' the majority of the sermon's energy is spent on the 'letter' that threatens. The 'mystery' of God is somewhat reduced to the 'eyes of the Judge.' Yet, in the final sections, a space is opened for the 'beauty of the heart' and the 'divine love' that casts out fear, allowing for a glimpse of the 'unavailable' grace of God.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between the 'already' of being a member of Christ and the 'not yet' of sinful impulse are sustained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the soul's life is explored, but the mystery of God's judgment is presented as quite transparent and certain.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Moralization prevails in the first half; grace is introduced as the 'solution' in the second half, but the final note returns to command.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'beauty of the heart' to breathe more in the conclusion, rather than ending on a note of 'at least do what is commanded'."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of patristic rhetoric, characterized by the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed and Catholic traditions. Its primary strength lies in its 'Poetics of Language'—specifically its precision and the masterful use of dialectic to map the human heart. Augustine avoids the 'kitsch' of easy comfort, opting instead for a 'reframing' of the body that is both terrifying and beautiful. The sermon functions as a 'performance' of pastoral care, using the preacher's voice to 'stand in' for the voice of Christ and the soul. While the structure is somewhat episodic and the ending leans toward a 'closed' moralism, the overall aesthetic effect is one of profound psychological and theological depth. It successfully moves the hearer from the 'sensory' (the fear of prison/death) to the 'spiritual' (the love of God), even if it uses the 'bridle' of fear to get there. The 'Space for Grace' is present but contested by the urgent need for moral correction.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Psychological precision in distinguishing types of fear and love.",
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the physical body as a sacred space.",
      "Rhythmic, oral quality that sustains engagement through direct address."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The structural transition between the 'hell' section and the 'soul-life' section is abrupt.",
      "The conclusion is aesthetically weaker and more 'closed' than the rest of the sermon.",
      "Heavy reliance on the 'fear of fire' risks overshadowing the 'beauty of grace'."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Rhetorical / Dialectical-Imagistic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Show don't tell), though it is more 'closed' than Ciska Stark's 'Open Work'.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who value logical clarity, psychological insight, and a 'high' view of the body's sanctity.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Explore the 'beauty of the soul' with more 'showing' and less 'telling' about its native charm.",
      "Create a more 'open' ending that invites the hearer into the mystery of grace rather than a minimum command.",
      "Smooth the transitions between the philosophical investigation of the soul and the biblical imagery."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Aesthetically, this is a 'strong' sermon (6.8/10) that serves as a model for how to use language with precision and how to 'reframe' human experience. It avoids the pitfalls of kitsch and sentimentality, offering instead a rigorous and beautiful vision of the Christian life. Its limitations are primarily structural and its tendency toward a 'closed' moralistic framework, which was characteristic of its historical context but limits its 'openness' as a work of art."
