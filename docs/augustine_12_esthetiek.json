    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in vivid, sensory imagery, particularly in its allegorical descriptions of Christ's person and the cosmic reaction to the Passion. It avoids abstract dogmatics by 'painting' the truth, as explicitly stated in §1. The use of gemstones to represent different classes of the faithful (§3) and the personification of nature during the crucifixion (§4) creates a 'cinematic' quality that Paul Scott Wilson advocates. The imagery is not merely decorative; it serves as a mnemonic and devotional tool, turning the theological concept of the 'Communion of Saints' into a visual royal procession. The contrast between the 'palette of earthly colors' and 'heavenly virtues' establishes an aesthetic hierarchy that favors the spiritual while using the material to point toward it.",
      "quotes": [
        "Christ Jesus painted it on our minds, not with a palette of diverse earthly colors, but with distinct heavenly virtues protected under the shield of devotion.",
        "His crown, his sash and his shoes are enhanced with precious gems designating the patriarchs, the prophets and the apostles.",
        "Night unfurled its hideous inky curtain over the entire face of the earth."

      "strengths": [
        "Strong 'show, don't tell' approach to Christology.",
        "Original and evocative metaphors (e.g., the 'inky curtain' of night).",
        "Effective use of light/darkness motifs to create atmospheric depth."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Some metaphors risk becoming 'precious' or overly decorative (gemstone allegory).",
        "The transition from the 'lampstand' to the 'cross' could be more visually grounded.",
        "The 'angel presiding over sun and stars' remains a bit detached from the central Christological image."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Predominantly 'showing'. The preacher uses visual allegories to demonstrate Christ's authority rather than simply stating it."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is highly disciplined and exhibits a 'stewardship of words' as defined by McEntyre. There is a clear precision in the titles and roles assigned to Christ (doctor, king, lamb, reason). The vocabulary is elevated but avoids unnecessary technical jargon, opting instead for a 'Canaanite' language that is rich in biblical allusion yet accessible through its rhythmic clarity. The preacher makes careful distinctions between the first and second coming, ensuring that the 'nuance of human experience' (the need for healing vs. the reality of judgment) is maintained. The economy of the final paragraph (§4) shows a high level of linguistic care, where each noun-verb pairing is intentional and balanced.",
      "quotes": [
        "The prophets, whose teachings constitute the undoable knot of discipline.",
        "Having come once as a doctor in order to save us, he will then come in order to reign as King of kings.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The phrase 'hideous inky curtain' is slightly hyperbolic compared to the rest of the text.",
        "The term 'wondrous economy' in §1 might require more context for a modern hearer.",
        "The repetition of 'though he came' in §2 is effective but borders on predictable."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Religious jargon like 'parricide' and 'economy' is used in its classical sense, functioning as precise descriptors rather than obscuring clichés."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is a masterclass in rhetorical musicality, utilizing parallelism, antithesis, and isocolon. The rhythmic cadence is particularly evident in §2 and §4, where the preacher uses repetitive structures ('Though he came... he will return...') to build a sense of inevitability and grandeur. This is 'oral language' at its best, designed for the ear to catch the symmetry of the Gospel. The variation in sentence length—moving from the long, descriptive opening to the staccato-like definitions of Christ in §4 ('when judging, he is the law; delivering souls, he is grace')—creates a dynamic 'flow' that prevents monotony. It reflects the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed/Classical tradition.",
      "quotes": [
        "Though he came in lowliness to serve, he will return in majesty to rule.",
        "When teaching, he is reason itself; when judging, he is the law; delivering souls, he is grace; suffering, he is the Lamb.",
        "To corpses he gives living souls; to frail bodies, resurrection; to the dead, life."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The opening paragraph is somewhat dense and 'heavy' compared to the rhythmic fluidity of the later sections.",
        "The transition between the gemstone allegory and the David/Goliath duel is rhythmically jarring.",
        "The final sentence is a standard liturgical formula that lacks the poetic energy of the preceding lines."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Strongly oral language. The use of rhetorical figures suggests a text written specifically for performance/proclamation."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of language in this sermon are characterized by a high rhetorical polish and a vivid, allegorical imagination. The preacher successfully avoids abstract boredom by 'painting' the faith with sensory metaphors—gemstones, light, and curtains of darkness. The rhythm is particularly strong, utilizing classical parallelism to create a sense of cosmic order. While occasionally leaning toward the ornate, the language remains precise and purposeful, demonstrating a deep stewardship of the word that honors the 'sober beauty' of the tradition while engaging the hearer's 'inner eye'."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a thematic rather than a strictly narrative arc, moving from the 'hidden mysteries' of the past to the 'splendors' of the future. While it lacks a 'Lowry-esque' upsetting of the equilibrium in a modern sense, it creates tension through the 'already/not yet' of Christ’s two comings. The movement is cosmic: from the archives of Israel to the cross, then to the netherworld, and finally to the eternal kingdom. However, the 'plot' feels somewhat static because the victory is presented as a fait accompli from the start. The energy is sustained by the shifting 'scenes' (the temple, the cross, the throne), but the hearer's journey is more of a guided tour through a gallery than a dramatic struggle.",
      "quotes": [
        "All this remained hidden, so to speak, beneath the veils of time.",
        "In this duel of David against Goliath, Jesus won the victory.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is deeply rooted in the biblical text, but the 'context' is almost entirely liturgical and theological rather than contemporary or situational. It 'reframes' reality by placing the hearer within a cosmic drama of light and darkness, but it offers little in the way of 'organic' connection to the daily lives of the congregation. The 'reframing' is high-level: the hearer is invited to see themselves as 'amethysts' or 'faithful' in Christ's kingdom. While this offers a new perspective on identity, it lacks the 'inter-esse' (Cilliers) of moving between the text and the messy reality of human despair. The 'strangeness' of the text is respected, but perhaps too much, leaving the application feeling somewhat distant.",
      "quotes": [
        "The patriarchs compose the crown on his forehead, not to adorn it, but to be adorned by the Lord.",
        "To earthly men he gives heavenly things.",
        "Just as nobody who wants to be healthy would turn against his doctor, so faith makes us friends of our King."

      "strengths": [
        "Deep integration of Old and New Testament imagery.",
        "Strong sense of the 'strangeness' and majesty of the Gospel.",
        "The metaphor of the 'doctor' provides a rare moment of relatable human logic."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Needs more concrete 'contextual' hooks to the hearer's current reality.",
        "The application is primarily intellectual/belief-oriented rather than life-oriented.",
        "The 'reframing' is cosmic but not personal."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "It offers a cosmic reframing of history, but fails to reframe the specific 'now' of the hearer's life."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward a 'closed' structure. It presents a complete system of truth—Christ as doctor, judge, and king—with little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' (Stark). The categories are neatly defined (martyrs as gems, virgins as pearls), and the conclusion is a prescriptive call to 'hold fast to this belief.' While the imagery is 'polyvalent' in its beauty, the theological message is monovalent: believe or face the judge. There is little room for doubt, struggle, or the 'not yet' of the human condition. It functions more as a 'monument' to truth than an 'open work of art' that invites the hearer to wrestle with the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is a mystery, but it is also a fact: a fact firmly believed and faithfully preached.",
        "No one imagine that in his second coming he will allow us to deny that he came once before.",
        "Let us hold fast to this belief, so that we may merit to live eternally."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Provides a strong sense of certainty and security for the believer.",
        "The 'mystery' is acknowledged, even if it is immediately labeled as 'fact'.",
        "The invitation to 'merit' eternal life provides a clear, if traditional, goal."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Allow more room for the 'unresolved' tensions of the Easter season.",
        "Reduce the 'coercive' tone regarding the Second Coming.",
        "End with a question or an invitation to wonder rather than a dogmatic command."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Closed work of art. It is a 'sealed' system of dogmatic truths presented through beautiful imagery."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 5.33,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is characterized by a grand, cosmic movement that lacks personal or situational specificity. While the 'narrative arc' successfully traverses the heights of heaven and the depths of the netherworld, it does so in a way that feels more like an established liturgy than a living struggle. The integration of text and context is heavily weighted toward the biblical 'then,' providing a 'reframing' of history but not necessarily of the hearer’s immediate life. The structure is largely 'closed,' offering a finished monument of faith rather than an open space for interpretation."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'cheap comfort' and 'pre-chewed emotions' by utilizing high-register rhetorical figures and cosmic imagery. The 'doctor' metaphor is handled with clinical precision rather than sentimental fluff. Even the gemstone allegory, which could risk becoming kitsch in a modern context, is grounded in a rigorous patristic tradition of symbolic theology. The description of the Passion is 'appalling' and 'hideous,' not 'sweet' or 'sentimental.' It sustains the tension between Christ's lowliness and his fearsome majesty, avoiding the 'happy ending' cliché by reminding the hearer of the impending judgment. This is 'authentic aesthetic depth' that takes the holiness of the subject seriously.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The gemstone allegory (martyrs as gems, virgins as pearls) is the only element that flirts with decorative kitsch, though it is saved by its liturgical weight.",
      "None found."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'inky curtain' of night and nature's 'appall' at the crucifixion.",
      "The stark contrast between the 'doctor' who saves and the 'judge' who rules."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of 'sober beauty' while ensuring the gemstone imagery doesn't become merely ornamental."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens 'space for grace' primarily through its focus on the 'wondrous economy' of Christ's work and the 'fragrance' of his love. However, this space is partially constricted by the heavy emphasis on 'meriting' eternal life and the 'fearsome' nature of the judge. While Cilliers' 'reframing' is present in the cosmic sense, the 'moralization' of belief ('let us hold fast... so that we may merit') tends to close the space that the grace of the Passion opened. The mystery of God is respected in the descriptions of Christ's dual nature, but the 'dogmatic seal' is strong. Grace is presented as an operative reality, but one that is strictly bounded by the hearer's adherence to the 'knot of discipline.'",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between suffering and power are well-sustained, but the tension between grace and merit is resolved too quickly in favor of merit.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, the 'celestial origin' and 'mystery' of the resurrection are given aesthetic weight.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the imagery, but moralization (the requirement of belief) prevails in the application.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'unarmed' victory of Christ to stand as a gift more than a condition for merit."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of classical homiletics, excelling in the 'Poetics of Language' while remaining somewhat rigid in its 'Dramaturgy of Structure.' Its greatest strength lies in its ability to 'paint' theological truths through vivid, sensory imagery—transforming abstract Christology into a royal procession of light, gemstones, and cosmic drama. The musicality of the text, with its rhythmic parallelism and antithesis, ensures that the 'holy happens' through the very sound of the proclamation. However, from the perspective of the 'aesthetic turn,' the sermon is overly 'closed.' It functions as a finished work of art that the hearer is invited to admire and believe, rather than an 'open work' that invites participation in the 'between' of existence. The lack of contemporary context and the move toward moralizing merit at the end slightly dampen the 'space for grace.' Nevertheless, its total avoidance of kitsch and its stewardship of language make it a high-quality example of 'sober-majestic' preaching.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Vivid, allegorical imagery that 'paints' the faith.",
      "Exceptional rhetorical rhythm and musicality.",
      "Authentic aesthetic depth that avoids religious kitsch."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase structural 'openness' to allow for hearer appropriation.",
      "Bridge the gap between cosmic 'reframing' and contemporary context.",
      "Soften the 'closed' dogmatic conclusion to leave more space for the mystery of grace."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Majestic / Patristic-Allegorical",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson and the 'Performance/Event' focus of Gerrit Immink, but lacks the 'Openness' of Ciska Stark.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who find security in tradition, liturgical beauty, and clear theological hierarchies; those who appreciate a 'grand narrative' over personal storytelling.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves a question for the hearer.",
      "Include a 'Page 2' (Wilson) that explores the 'trouble' of the human condition more concretely.",
      "Use the 'reframing' technique to look at a specific modern situation through the lens of the 'gemstone' allegory."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically 'good' sermon (6.5) that serves as a strong model for language care and imagery. It successfully avoids the pitfalls of modern sentimentality, offering instead a 'sober beauty' that honors the majesty of its subject. To reach a higher aesthetic score, it would need to move beyond its 'closed' structure and create more 'inter-esse' between the ancient text and the contemporary human experience."
