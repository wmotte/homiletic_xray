      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon connects with the hearer's world through the concept of 'adulthood' and the bureaucratic reality of 'memos' and 'briefs'. However, it lacks a specific, localized narrative or 'slice of life' that would anchor the experience in a singular, visceral moment. The experience is more of a shared cultural condition than a personal, emotional identification with a character or situation.",

      "analysis": "This is a primary strength of the sermon. It offers a deep cultural critique of Western civilization's reliance on logic and power. It pauses to ask 'why' we are stuck in these patterns and explores the 'problem' of the 'memo' from historical, political, and psychological perspectives. It successfully identifies the 'constricted, frightened logic' that governs the hearer.",

      "analysis": "The sermon provides a clear theological framework: the 'Poem' as a vehicle for God's subversion and summons. It engages in solid exegesis of Isaiah 11, defining terms like 'wisdom' and 'understanding' in contrast to 'data'. The 'Big Idea' is the ontological shift from a world of control to a world of God's 'impossible' newness.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "While the sermon ends with a 'summons to action', the applications remain somewhat metaphorical and abstract. The call to 'be a carrier of wisdom' or 'embrace the lamb' is poetic but lacks the 'how-to' specificity required for high-level active experimentation. It invites a change in posture more than a change in specific behavior.",

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a sophisticated homiletical piece that effectively completes the Kolb cycle, though with an uneven distribution of weight. It is a model for how to use 'Reflective Observation' to deconstruct cultural idols. Its primary achievement is the creation of a 'Homiletic Window' that moves the hearer from the sterile logic of the 'Memo' to the life-giving possibility of the 'Poem'. To reach the next level of effectiveness, the preacher should focus on translating this visionary 'Summons' into the 'Pragmatic' language of daily discipleship, ensuring that the 'hands' are as engaged as the 'head' and 'heart'."
