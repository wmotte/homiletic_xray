Amen."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses the Great Commission as a springboard for a topical discussion on 'evangelism' versus 'proselytizing' and 'multiculturalism'. It fails to identify what is unique to Matthew 28 that cannot be found elsewhere. The text is treated as a 'strategic place' rather than a specific, irreplaceable word.",
      "quotes": [
        "These words of our Lord are found in a strategic place, for they are the concluding words of the first book of the New Testament, the Gospel of Matthew."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus on the specific Matthean emphasis of 'all authority' and 'making disciples' rather than general concepts of 'good news' found throughout the New Testament."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Exegesis is almost entirely absent. There is no mention of the original context of the disciples, the mountain in Galilee, or the specific Greek nuances of the imperative. The preacher relies on a general definition of 'evangel' rather than historical-grammatical exposition of the pericope.",
      "quotes": [
        "The word evangel is a New Testament Greek word, lying at the heart and center of our faith."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Engage with the specific context of the post-resurrection appearance in Matthew and the implications of the Jewish-Christian tension inherent in 'all nations'."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the New York context and the 'zeitgeist' of multiculturalism. However, it borders on a sociological lecture. It effectively addresses the 'cultural tsars' and the media, which aligns with Dekker's requirement for knowledge of the humanities.",
      "quotes": [
        "In the meantime, back here in New York, we are part of the most multicultural society on earth...",
        "This is the way it is today, even in ultra-religious America; authentic Christianity meets with antagonism from the ruling class..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move from sociological observation (multiculturalism) to the specific spiritual demand the text places on the hearer's life design."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is more of a thematic essay than an interwoven exposition. The text is quoted as a block and then the preacher moves into anecdotes and social commentary. The 'present of revelation' where the text and the hearer meet is obscured by the focus on 'religion' as a concept.",
      "quotes": [
        "They are enacting the words of Jesus in the Book of Acts...",
        "Here is a little parable of multicultural Christianity."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Allow the specific movements of the Bible passage to dictate the structure of the contemporary application, rather than using anecdotes to illustrate general ideas."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon strongly emphasizes the 'misery' of the 'ungodly' and the 'dirt' of human existence. It correctly identifies redemption as coming from outside the self (God's grace) rather than 'spirituality'. This is a strong point in line with Dekker's Trinitarian requirement.",
      "quotes": [
        "I am not saved by my spirituality. I am not saved by my religion... I am saved by God.",
        "What’s the second secret ingrediment, then? It’s D-I-R-T. Not just William’s dirt, but my dirt, your dirt..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'gratitude' (the third part) is more clearly linked to the specific command of the text (discipleship) rather than just a general feeling of being 'washed clean'."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The sermon almost entirely avoids the 'two ways'. It emphasizes that the gospel is 'for everyone' in a way that suggests a lack of ultimate consequence or the possibility of being lost. The 'seriousness of the journey' is replaced by a celebratory multiculturalism.",
      "quotes": [
        "The good news of the Christian gospel, however, is for everyone.",
        "In him all races meet. In him all threads are woven together."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the reality that the 'Great Commission' implies a world that is lost without this news, and that the call to 'teach all nations' involves a decision with eternal weight."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos in terms of being the source of grace for the 'unlovely'. The sermon maintains a high Christology (the Trinity as an 'event'). However, Christ is sometimes used as a symbol for 'relationships' rather than the specific Lord of Matthew 28.",
      "quotes": [
        "The incarnation of Jesus Christ, the Second Person of the Trinity... is good news for every person.",
        "All the dirt was assumed by God himself in the person of his Son as he died on the cross."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'all power' (authority) of Christ in the text to his role as the one who detaches man from himself."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1450 words, the sermon likely clocks in under 15 minutes. According to Thesis 8, it lacks the 'breadth' required for true depth. It feels more like a 'talk' or 'address' than a substantive sermon.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical portion to provide the 'breadth' necessary for the theological claims made in the second half."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily due to its lack of specific biblical exposition and its insufficient length. It functions as a topical address on multiculturalism rather than an actualization of the specific Word of God in Matthew 28. While it correctly identifies the 'misery' of human self-righteousness and points to Christ as the source of grace, it avoids the 'two ways' and the seriousness of being lost.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong rejection of 'spirituality' and 'religion' in favor of objective grace.",
      "Adequate understanding of the zeitgeist and cultural tensions in New York.",
      "Clear Trinitarian grounding for the concept of relationship."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specific exegesis of the Matthew 28 pericope.",
      "Insufficient duration to achieve homiletical depth.",
      "Absence of the 'two ways' or the possibility of being lost.",
      "Over-reliance on anecdotes (William, Pogo, Billy Graham) over the biblical text."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the strict sense defined by Dekker; it is a 'speech about the gospel' and 'multiculturalism' that uses a Bible passage as a pretext rather than its source."
