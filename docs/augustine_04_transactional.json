    "summary": "The sermon is a masterful example of the 'Bait and Switch' between Law and Grace. While it offers profound comfort (NP), it psychologically traps the listener in a permanent state of 'Adapted Child' wretchedness. By insisting that 'power is made perfect in weakness,' it risks sanctifying psychological passivity and dependency. The preacher acts as a Rescuer who ensures the Victim never truly becomes an autonomous Adult, as 'victory' is perpetually deferred to the afterlife.",

      "Lack of Adult-Adult empowerment for practical, here-and-now change."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as 'Fellow Adults' who have agency. Instead of focusing solely on the 'Physician' (Rescuer), focus on the 'Spirit' as a resource that the listener can learn to use autonomously."
