  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher establishes a clear exegetical foundation by highlighting the 'missing' description of the Resurrection in the New Testament. This 'blue' side serves a specific theological function: emphasizing the transcendence of God (Barthian 'Wholly Other'). The factual content is not merely informative but serves to deconstruct human epistemological pride. The preacher correctly identifies the 'Sache' as the Risen Lord who remains outside human comprehension. However, the transition from the empty tomb to modern sociological observations (cosmetic surgery, NRA, prison systems) is rapid, occasionally risking the dilution of the theological 'Sache' into a cultural critique.",
      "quotes": [
        "We search the New Testament in vain for a description of the Resurrection itself.",
        "It is out of our range of understanding because it comes from another sphere of reality.",
        "Faith in the Resurrection simply is not available on general principles."

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a personality that is intellectually engaged, slightly ironic, and grounded in a specific social milieu (rural New England, academic/clerical circles). There is a significant amount of 'I' in the sermon—personal anecdotes about face-lifts, files on death, and conversations with children. While this creates authenticity, there is a risk of the 'I' becoming the lens through which the Gospel is validated. The self-revelation is largely 'diaconal' in that it models the struggle with aging and mortality, but the frequent use of 'my files' and 'my favorite articles' suggests a preacher who finds security in intellectual curation.",
      "quotes": [
        "I do it about ten times a day. (referring to pushing at her face)",
        "I'm telling my children that when I am an old lady they had better not come at me with any plastic bag.",

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Hysterical blend. Compulsive in the need to 'file' and 'teach' (the undertaker, the congregation), but Hysterical in the vivid, dramatic storytelling and the use of the pulpit for personal wit.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' serves as a bridge to the congregation's own fears of aging, making the transcendence of the text more relatable.",
      "strengths": [

        "Honesty about the struggle with vanity and fear."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is one of a 'Teaching Mother' or 'Wise Mentor'. The preacher speaks 'with' the congregation about shared cultural anxieties but maintains a clear 'above' position when correcting societal views on suicide or funeral practices. There is a sense of 'we' (the Christian community) against 'them' (the desensitized world, the NRA, the 'death industry'). This creates a strong in-group identity but might feel paternalistic to those who do not share the preacher's specific political or social sensibilities. The tone is authoritative yet conversational.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have a good relationship with our local undertaker, but it has taken a lot of work and a lot of teaching...",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in the Zuspruch (Promise) vs. Anspruch (Demand) balance. The central appeal is not 'do more' but 'look elsewhere'—a call to faith. The preacher correctly identifies that the Resurrection is not a human 'fix' but a divine gift. The 'red' side is directional: it moves the hearer from the 'death industry' of the world to the 'life' of Christ. While there are moral appeals (outrage over brutality), they are secondary to the primary appeal of 'trust'. This follows the Barthian priority of Grace over Law.",
      "quotes": [
        "Faith in the Resurrection comes to us as a pure gift.",

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Excellent. The 'Gift' (Resurrection) is the absolute foundation for the 'Task' (seeking things above).",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Low. Even the political critiques are framed as symptoms of a 'condition of our souls' rather than a checklist for salvation.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a strong, sophisticated sermon that successfully navigates the tension between human psychological needs and theological reality. The preacher uses the Four Sides effectively, particularly by using the 'Green' side (personal anecdotes) to dismantle the 'Yellow' side's potential for distance. Theologically, it is firmly rooted in the tradition of Barth and Immink, treating God as the 'Acting Subject' of the Resurrection rather than a psychological projection. The sermon’s greatest strength is its refusal to 'psychologize' the Resurrection into a mere 'coping mechanism.' Instead, it presents faith as a 're-empowerment' that comes from outside the human system. The critique of the 'death industry' and 'control' is sharp and homiletically sound. The only minor weakness is a tendency toward 'curated' self-revelation (the 'my files' trope), which can occasionally feel more like a lecture than a proclamation. However, the final movement toward the 'pure gift' of the Resurrection restores the homiletical focus to the Gospel.",
    "barthian_warning": "The preacher avoids the 'Erlebnis' trap by emphasizing that the Resurrection is 'out of our control' and 'from another sphere.' God remains the Subject.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological refusal to 'tame' death or the Resurrection.",
      "Effective use of humor and cultural critique to ground the message.",
      "Strong balance of Zuspruch (Promise) over Anspruch (Demand)."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce the 'curator' persona ('in my files', 'I read an article').",
      "Tighten the link between political 'outrage' and the Easter promise.",
      "Ensure the 'Teaching' tone doesn't alienate those outside the preacher's social circle."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively integral and theologically robust sermon that honors the 'mystery' of the Word while speaking directly to the human condition."
