At the very beginning we hear the proclamation that the light of the incarnate Word of God comes to shine in the darkness (1:5). Repeatedly in this gospel, Jesus teaches that he brings light to the world [...] The message of the resurrection is indeed too wonderful for us. Flesh and blood cannot inherit it. It is grasped only by faith. Through the Word of God the Holy Spirit creates such faith in those who gladly hear the message."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on one specific passage, instead combining three distinct pericopes (Easter Day, 2nd Sunday, 3rd Sunday). This violates Dekker's rule that a sermon is exposition of 'one specific Bible passage'. It treats the Bible as a collection of themes (darkness, doubt, revelation) rather than recreating one specific text into a current word.",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is basic awareness of Johannine symbolism (light/dark) and Jewish burial customs, but it lacks the depth of Hebrew/Greek linguistic analysis or the rigorous religious history Dekker demands. The exegesis remains at a literary-thematic level.",

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding human suffering (the Alabama tornado), which aligns with Dekker's demand for 'true truth' being concrete. However, it occasionally drifts into generalities about 'the death of a career' or 'the loss of youth'.",
      "quotes": [
        "In 1994, a church in Piedmont, Alabama, was destroyed by a tornado...",

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a pattern of 'text then illustration'. While the Alabama story is powerful, it stands as a block of application following a block of exposition. The 'present of revelation' where text and hearer converge is interrupted by the jumps between three different biblical texts.",
      "quotes": [
        "Thomas stands for all of us here... In 1994, a church in Piedmont..."

      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is strong on 'misery' (the darkness, the grave, the tornado). It avoids 'soft' misery. Redemption is correctly placed outside of man (Christ as the light). Gratitude is less explicitly developed but implied in the call to confession.",

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon mentions a 'real choice' between a man-made god and the biblical God, but the ultimate seriousness of being 'lost' (temporal or eternal) is muted. It leans toward a 'baffling' God rather than the urgency of the narrow way.",

      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon emphasizes the two natures (the wounded man who is 'My Lord and my God') and insists on salvation coming from outside the self. This is the strongest part of the sermon.",

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "At approximately 2100 words, the sermon meets the 20-minute threshold. However, because it covers three different Sunday themes, the 'breadth' does not necessarily lead to 'depth' for a single passage.",

  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text provided is not a single sermon but a compilation of three distinct homiletical reflections. According to Dekker's theses, this fails the primary formal requirement of being an exposition of 'one specific Bible passage'. While the Christological focus is adequate and the acknowledgment of human misery is sharp, the lack of focus prevents the 'nowhere else' quality of a specific text from emerging. The application is concrete but the structure remains too thematic.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christocentric focus on the 'two natures' and Christ as the telos.",
      "Adequate length to allow for theological development.",
      "Refusal to offer 'soft' comfort, maintaining the reality of death and suffering."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Violation of the 'one specific passage' rule by merging multiple texts.",
      "Lack of explicit 'two ways'/seriousness of being lost.",
      "Exegesis remains thematic rather than linguistically or historically rigorous."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a collection of strong theological reflections, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict sense of Dekker's definition. It functions more as a thematic speech about 'Easter' and 'Doubt' than an actualization of a specific written Word of God."
