        "analysis": "The preacher admits his own 'Presbyterian' tendencies toward compliance, modeling a move away from the Adapted Child role.",

    "purity_explanation": "10 = Completely transparent. The preacher is very open about the difficulty of the text and his own position within the critique.",
    "risk_explanation": "The only risk is a subtle 'Ain't It Awful' regarding the decline of industrialism/privilege, but it is used to prompt Adult action rather than Child passivity."

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The sermon avoids games by maintaining an Adult-Adult stance. It doesn't promise a 'simple solution' (Con) to avoid the 'Switch.' Instead, it presents a 'hard, radical teaching' and leaves the choice to the listener."

    "preacher_roles": {
      "rescuer": "Low. He doesn't offer to save the congregation; he points to the need for them to make friends.",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' By speaking from an Adult ego position, the preacher respects the autonomy of the listeners. He avoids the 'Critical Parent' trap of moralizing the parable and instead uses 'Structural Analysis' to compare two worldviews (God vs. Mammon). The preacher’s self-inclusion ('I assume you are like me') prevents a hierarchical Parent-Child transaction, fostering a space for authentic reflection.",
    "strengths": [
      "High Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "Avoidance of shaming or coercive language.",
      "Honest acknowledgment of the 'hard' nature of the text."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The section on 'when it is gone' could briefly trigger a 'Victim' response in listeners if not balanced with more 'Free Child' hope.",
      "The 'Presbyterian' label is a mild stereotype that could be perceived as a 'Critical Parent' judgment by some."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' and 'us' to maintain the Adult-Adult contract. Ensure that the 'Free Child's' joy and creativity are emphasized as much as the 'Adult's' shrewdness to prevent the sermon from becoming purely intellectual."
