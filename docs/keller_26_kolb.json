[...] Run to the doctrine of the resurrection. Run to it, and you will receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken. Let’s pray.",

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience primarily through identifying universal human anxieties regarding transience and loss. While it lacks a singular, immersive narrative 'hook' at the start, it effectively uses 'slices of life'—such as the aging model or the experience of listening to music—to ground the message. However, the experience remains somewhat intellectualized; the hearer is invited to think about their feelings rather than being fully immersed in a visceral story.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength of the sermon. The preacher excels at pausing to analyze the human condition and 'why' we feel insecure. He utilizes cultural critique (New York Times example) and scientific perspectives (thermodynamics) to explore the problem of transience from multiple angles. He avoids premature solutions by first establishing the absolute lack of foundations in the material world.",

The exegesis of the Hebrew ('face' vs 'presence') and the integration of C.S. Lewis’s 'creative rapture' provide significant intellectual depth and logical coherence.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the sermon is 'practical' in its intent, the application remains largely internal and cognitive ('run to the doctrine,' 'say to the Lord'). There are few concrete, external action steps for the hearer to implement in their Monday-to-Saturday life. The call to 'pursue God' is clear but lacks a 'how-to' for the novice practitioner.",

    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of a 'Declarative-Visionary' approach that prioritizes intellectual and theological depth. It begins by identifying a universal human need for security, then systematically deconstructs the reliability of material, intellectual, and emotional foundations. The analysis of 'why' the world is shaking is profound, utilizing both cultural and scientific insights. The theological core—the resurrection of Christ as the guarantee of an unshakable kingdom—is logically developed and enriched by evocative imagery from C.S. Lewis. However, the sermon falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase. The application is primarily internal and cognitive, offering few concrete handles for daily life. While it brilliantly serves the 'Assimilating' learner, it may leave the 'Accommodating' learner without a clear sense of how to embody these truths. The movement through the Homiletic Window is strategic but lacks a strong narrative component to ground the abstract concepts in a lived-through story.",

    "conclusion": "The sermon is a high-quality intellectual discourse that successfully completes the 'Reflective' and 'Conceptual' phases of the Kolb cycle. It is particularly effective for a skeptical or educated audience (Assimilating style). To move from a 'strong' sermon to a 'model' sermon, it must bridge the gap between the 'unshakable kingdom' of the mind and the 'unshakable life' of the hands. The priority for improvement is the development of the Pragmatic task and the Narrative structure to ensure the truth is not only understood but also felt and practiced."
