    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery effectively by juxtaposing the mundane (the airplane aisle seat) with the cosmic (the throne of the Lamb). Brueggemann excels at 'painting the picture' of the 'great ordeal' not as an abstract theological concept, but as a cast of characters: hard-nosed judges, surveillance mechanisms, and angry preachers. This follows Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' principle by personifying the 'empire.' The imagery of the 'Lamb' is consistently held as a counter-image to the 'hard power' of the empire. However, the imagery remains largely socio-political rather than sensory; we hear the 'command' and see the 'throne,' but the 'stench' or 'touch' of the biblical world is less present than its ideological structures.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably precise and avoids traditional 'Canaanite' jargon. Instead of using 'sanctification' or 'justification,' the preacher speaks of 'small decisions' and 'settled arrangements.' This is stewardship of language in the vein of McEntyre; words like 'capitulated,' 'generative,' and 'national exceptionalism' are used with surgical intent. The preacher carefully defines the 'great ordeal' as 'severe pressure to keep things as they were.' There is a rhythmic economy in the prose where every word serves the 'reframing' of the hearer's reality. The precision lies in naming the contemporary idols (market, technology, corporations) specifically rather than hiding behind generalities like 'the world.'",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a distinct cadence, characterized by repetitive list-making and short, punchy declarations. This creates a 'staccato' effect that mirrors the urgency of the 'ordeal.' There is a liturgical rhythm in the sections where the preacher lists the attributes of the saints or the actions of God ('Who raised Dorcas / Who leads to the water...'). This parallelism strengthens the oral impact. However, the rhythm is somewhat monotonous in the middle section; the sentence lengths become uniform during the exposition of the 'empire,' which can lead to a 'paper language' feel if not delivered with dynamic vocal variety.",
      "quotes": [
        "Who raised Dorcas, Who leads to the water of life, Who wipes away every tear.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high degree of linguistic stewardship. It avoids the 'kitsch' of sentimental religious language by using sharp, socio-political terminology that 'reframes' the biblical text. The imagery is effective in its personification of abstract powers, and the rhythm is well-suited for a proclamation. While it could benefit from more sensory 'showing' in the narrative of Dorcas, the precision of its vocabulary makes the message both clear and challenging. It is a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that finds beauty in the clarity of its conviction."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear, almost pedagogical structure (I, II, III). It begins with a 'low-stakes' personal anecdote (the airplane) that introduces the 'upsetting of equilibrium'—the tension between self-interest and the needs of others. This 'little decision' serves as the hook for the 'big decision' of the martyrs. The movement from the cosmic vision of Revelation to the private room of Dorcas provides a decent narrative shift. However, the 'turning point' is more intellectual than dramatic. The energy remains fairly constant throughout; there isn't a mounting tension that breaks into a climax, but rather a steady build-up of a 'counter-argument' against the empire.",
      "quotes": [
        "I recently flew to LA... I was tired and cranky, and said, 'No'.",
        "But Peter intervenes! He does not come to grieve.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest aesthetic feature. Brueggemann performs a masterclass in 'reframing' (Cilliers). He takes the 1st-century 'empire' of Revelation and seamlessly maps it onto contemporary 'militarism, consumerism, and greed.' The integration is not forced; it respects the 'strangeness' of the apocalyptic text while making it immediate. The 'reframing' occurs when the hearer realizes that their 'small decisions' (like seat choices) are actually liturgical acts within or against an imperial system. It moves the text from 'pie in the sky' to a 'recognition' of how the world is organized, offering a new lens to view daily life.",
      "quotes": [
        "the empire of Rome as our empire today—has all the power, all the wealth, all the technology",
        "The great ordeal is the effort of established power... to talk us out of authentic gospel obedience.",

        "Brilliant 'reframing' of the 'Great Ordeal' as modern systemic pressure.",

        "Provide a bit more historical context for the 'Roman Empire' to ground the metaphor.",
        "The connection to Psalm 23 is mentioned but not fully integrated into the 'reframing' logic.",
        "Ensure the 'context' doesn't swallow the 'text'—the focus on 'empire' occasionally overshadows the 'Lamb'."

      "reframing_present": "Strongly present; the sermon offers a radical new frame for viewing both the Bible and modern society."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is rhetorically powerful, it leans towards a 'closed' structure. The preacher has a very specific interpretation of 'empire' and 'gospel' that doesn't leave much room for ambivalence or alternative readings. It is a 'witness' (Long) but one that is highly persuasive and almost coercive in its definitions. However, the 'openness' is found in the application: 'Who knows?' This phrase invites the hearer to imagine their own 'small decisions.' The ending is an invitation rather than a command, which provides some 'space for the hearer' (Stark). Yet, the theological categories are so tightly defined that there is little room for the 'mystery' of the ordeal itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "The true story is the story of God who makes things new",
        "Who knows? It might allow making decisions against what we thought is settled truth.",
        "It is good news for us, even amid the ordeal of the empire."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The use of 'Who knows?' creates a small opening for the hearer's agency.",
        "The conclusion is an invitation to a new way of living, not just a moral checklist.",
        "Acknowledges the 'ordeal' is ongoing, not cheaply resolved."

        "Leave more room for the 'ambivalence' of those who feel trapped in the empire.",
        "Avoid the 'Do I have to tell you...' phrasing, which can feel condescending to the 'mature conversation partner'.",
        "Allow the 'mystery' of the resurrection of Dorcas to remain a bit more mysterious."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly monovalent; the sermon has a clear, singular message, though the application remains slightly open-ended."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon's structure is a sophisticated 'reframing' exercise. It successfully bridges the gap between ancient text and modern context, creating a coherent world-view for the hearer. While the narrative arc is somewhat predictable and the theological categories are tightly sealed, the move from the 'cosmic throne' to the 'airplane seat' provides a compelling dramaturgical bridge. It functions as a 'witness' that demands a decision, though it could benefit from more 'openness' to the complexities and failures of the hearers within the 'ordeal'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'pre-chewed emotions' and 'happy endings' by taking the 'ordeal' seriously. Brueggemann explicitly rejects 'pie in the sky' theology. The comfort offered is not 'cheap' because it is rooted in 'vulnerability' and 'the lamb that was slain.' There is no sentimentalizing of Dorcas's death; it is treated as a 'zone of death' that requires a 'command.' The refusal to resolve the 'ordeal' of the empire with a simple prayer or a 'feel-good' story demonstrates authentic aesthetic depth. The 'aisle seat' anecdote is self-deprecating rather than 'cute,' which grounds the sermon in reality.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None significant; the sermon avoids the typical 'Jesus is the answer' clichés.",

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the concept of 'vulnerability.' By identifying God with the 'Lamb that was slain' rather than the 'hard power' of the empire, the sermon creates a 'space for grace' (Cilliers) that is accessible to the weak and the suffering. However, the space is slightly constricted by the strong socio-political 'moralization' of the gospel. While it isn't 'legalistic' in a traditional sense, it creates a new 'imperative' of resistance that might feel like a heavy burden. The 'mystery' of God is present in the 'command' to Dorcas, but it is quickly harnessed for the sermon's 'counter-imperial' agenda.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'already' of the throne and the 'not yet' of the ordeal is well-sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the resurrection is respected by being placed 'away from the cameras' and in 'private'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails as the 'funding' for action, but the 'moral imperative' to resist the empire is very strong.",
    "recommendation": "Allow more space for the 'unavailable' work of the Spirit that doesn't immediately result in a 'decision' or 'action'."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of the 'Aesthetic Turn' as 'Reframing.' It avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch and sentimentalism by employing a sharp, almost prophetic vocabulary that challenges the hearer's perception of reality. The aesthetic power lies in its 'sober beauty'—the clarity with which it contrasts the 'hard power' of the world with the 'vulnerable power' of the Lamb. It follows the North American 'New Homiletic' by using a narrative 'hook' and moving toward a 'plot' that links the cosmic and the mundane. While it is rhetorically 'closed' in its ideological framework, it opens 'space for grace' by redefining power as vulnerability. The language is precise, the structure is coherent, and the integration of text and context is exemplary. It is an 'Easter mouthful' that refuses to be swallowed easily, demanding that the hearer 'see' the world through the lens of the Lamb.",

      "Experiment with a more 'open ending' that leaves the hearer in the mystery of the text.",

      "Try a 'Lowry Loop' structure to increase the narrative tension before the resolution."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust piece of homiletical 'witness.' It succeeds in its primary task of 'reframing' reality through the lens of the Gospel. By rejecting the 'kitsch' of easy comfort, it creates a 'space for grace' that is both intellectually honest and spiritually challenging. It is a model of how to use precise language and structural integration to make an ancient text speak with contemporary urgency. While it could benefit from more 'polyphony' and sensory depth, its 'sober beauty' makes it a compelling and effective 'open work' for the modern hearer."
