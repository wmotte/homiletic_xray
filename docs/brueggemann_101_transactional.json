    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' common in religious discourse. By using 'we' and identifying with the hesitation of the biblical characters, the preacher avoids the Critical Parent trap. He addresses the congregation as Adult subjects capable of self-reflection. The move from the 'Adapted Child' (fearful/held back) to the 'Free Child' (joyful/ecstatic) is handled through an Adult analysis of the text rather than emotional manipulation.",

      "Validation of the listener's resistance (reducing shame).",
      "Appeal to sensory, authentic experience (Free Child)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The description of human recruits as 'pitiful' could lean toward a Persecutor/Victim dynamic if not balanced by the later emphasis on 'transformative power.'",
      "The list of 'stuff to avoid' (Paul) is the only moment where Critical Parent language briefly enters, though it is framed as 'damaging the neighborhood' (Adult logic)."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using the 'we' pronoun to maintain the Adult-Adult level. The liturgical suggestion of 'two steps forward, one step back' is an excellent way to engage the Free Child without bypassing the Adult's recognition of reality."
