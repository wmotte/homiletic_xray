    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is rhetorically beautiful but psychologically regressive. It utilizes a Parent-Child dynamic that reinforces the listener's sense of helplessness (Victim) to highlight the necessity of the Savior (Rescuer). While it offers comfort, it does so by first heightening existential anxiety ('Samarkand') and then offering a mystical escape, bypassing the Adult ego's need for practical agency in the 'here-and-now'.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as capable Adult agents. Instead of focusing solely on the 'Way' as an escape from death, explore 'The Way' as a series of Adult choices and responsibilities in the present world. Reduce the use of fear-based narratives (like the Samarkand story) which trigger the Adapted Child."
