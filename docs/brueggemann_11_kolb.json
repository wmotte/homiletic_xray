    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a highly recognizable contemporary scene: the celebration of a football lineman. This facilitates immediate identification for a North American audience. The preacher successfully connects the 'feeling' of self-assertion and the desire for recognition to the theological concept of Epiphany. However, the experience remains somewhat observational rather than deeply personal or emotive for the hearer's own life until the later introduction of the 'three-year-old' and 'feeble father' imagery.",

        "After almost every play, some lineman rises out of the debris, waves his fist and gestures to the crowd in triumph.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The experience is largely metaphorical; adding a non-metaphorical, direct human experience from the congregation's context would ground it further.",

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Reflection is achieved by contrasting the 'glory script' of the world with the 'behavior' of Yahweh. The preacher pauses to ask 'Why did you leave the game?' through the voice of a journalist, forcing a reflection on motivations. However, the 'problem' of our own obsession with glory is mostly addressed through the lens of the metaphor rather than a direct cultural or psychological analysis of the congregation's specific struggles with pride.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides solid theological depth by distinguishing between the P and J sources of the Pentateuch—a sophisticated move for a general sermon. It defines 'glory' through the Hebrew concepts of hesed and 'emeth. The 'big idea' is clear: God's glory is redefined as 'precious relatedness.' While the exegesis is present, it is subordinated to the metaphor, which may slightly obscure the biblical text's own internal logic for some.",

      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. The sermon concludes with 'pondering' and a general call to remember we are made in God's image. While it mentions being 'committed, caring, vulnerable,' it lacks specific, concrete action steps. The hearer is left with a new perspective but few 'handles' for how to implement this 'new glory' in the coming week beyond a mental shift.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a intellectually stimulating and creatively framed exploration of the nature of God's glory. It succeeds in deconstructing the cultural 'glory script' through a vivid sports metaphor, which serves as an effective Concrete Experience. The preacher demonstrates strong theological depth (Abstract Conceptualization) by introducing source criticism and Hebrew linguistics in an accessible manner. However, the sermon is imbalanced; it focuses heavily on the 'Assimilating' learning style (thinking and watching) while neglecting the 'Converging' and 'Accommodating' styles (doing and applying). The transition from the 'what' and 'why' to the 'how' is largely absent, leaving the congregation with the task of 'pondering' rather than acting. While the 'Normative' task is handled with prophetic clarity, the 'Pragmatic' task is underdeveloped, resulting in a sermon that is more of a theological meditation than a call to lived transformation.",

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong example of 'Visionary-Declarative' preaching that effectively re-imagines a core theological concept. It is intellectually rigorous and narratively engaging. However, from a Kolb perspective, it fails to complete the learning cycle. It excels at changing how a hearer *thinks* about God but provides little guidance on how the hearer should *live* in response. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'new notion of glory' and the 'new practice of life'."
