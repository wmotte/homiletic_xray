  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It avoids the common 'Critical Parent' trap of holiness preaching. Instead, it uses the Adult ego to deconstruct legalism and the Nurturing Parent to offer a relational alternative. By defining holiness as 'belonging' rather than 'compliance,' it promotes psychological maturity and autonomy. The preacher successfully avoids 'Games' by being transparent about the intellectual and emotional costs of the Christian life.",

      "The heavy reliance on the Adult (intellect) might leave those in a 'Child' state of emotional crisis feeling slightly disconnected.",
      "The 'Mighty Men' story, while effective, could be seen as an 'Idealized Parent' standard that is hard to reach."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to invite the 'Free Child' into the experience of 'gorgeous' holiness to balance the heavy 'Adult' intellectual load."
