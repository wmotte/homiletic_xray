    "risk_explanation": "The only slight risk is a 'Social Adult / Psychological Parent' transaction where the preacher uses logic (Adult) to lead the listener into a feeling of guilt (Child) for being 'merely moral,' though he quickly resolves this with grace."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of common homiletical 'games.' By operating primarily from the Adult ego state, the preacher respects the listener's agency and intellect. He successfully deconstructs the Critical Parent (moralism) and the Adapted Child (compliance) dynamics that often plague religious discourse. The transition to the Nurturing Parent/Free Child at the end provides a healthy emotional payoff based on 'awe' rather than 'guilt.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "Effective deconstruction of moralistic coercion.",
      "Redefinition of 'fear' as 'awe' (moving from AC to FC)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'New Yorker' example could lean toward a subtle 'Ain't It Awful' game if the preacher isn't careful about stereotyping the 'other'.",
      "Slightly more Free Child spontaneity could balance the heavy Adult intellectualism."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' instead of 'you' when discussing shortcomings to avoid the Persecutor role. Maintain the emphasis on 'thinking out implications' as it keeps the listener in their Adult ego state."
