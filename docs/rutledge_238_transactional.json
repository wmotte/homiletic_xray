    "summary": "While theologically sophisticated and 'orthodox' in a Reformation sense, the sermon is psychologically coercive. It relies on 'Ain't It Awful' dynamics to create an in-group of 'correct' believers against a world of 'ignorant' clergy. The preacher uses his 65 years of experience as a 'Critical Parent' stick to beat the 'Adapted Child' listeners into theological submission. The focus on God as the 'acting subject' is paradoxically used to diminish the human listener's agency and autonomy, creating a dependency on the preacher's 'authoritative' interpretation.",

      "Lack of Free Child spontaneity or genuine Nurturing Parent warmth."

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as fellow Adults rather than students to be corrected. Instead of using 'Ain't It Awful' about other preachers, share your own struggle with the 'Order of the Sentence' to move from Persecutor to a vulnerable, authentic human subject."
