    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely game-free. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, utilizing sociological data and logical sequencing to invite the listener into a responsible, autonomous faith. By identifying himself with the listener’s doubts and the community’s failures, the preacher avoids the 'Critical Parent' trap. The focus on 'neighborliness' over 'private experience' promotes healthy external engagement rather than narcissistic withdrawal.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'we' language and citing external reality (Adult data) to ground theological claims. To maintain this health, ensure that the 'suffering' mentioned doesn't become a 'Kick Me' game where the congregation seeks out pain to feel holy."
