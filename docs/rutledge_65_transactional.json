        "analysis": "While the preacher uses strong language regarding 'evil' and 'judgment,' it is directed at the human condition generally rather than used as a tool to shame the specific audience into compliance. The CP is used to deconstruct cultural ego, not to coerce the listener.",

      "analysis": "The preacher operates heavily from the Adult position by acting as a 'realist.' He processes the data of mortality (ALS, hospital beds, aging) objectively and invites the listener to do the same, testing cultural 'positive thinking' against reality.",

    "analysis": "The preacher primarily invites the listener into an Adult-to-Adult transaction by asking rhetorical questions that require objective self-assessment. He avoids the typical 'Preacher-Parent to Sinner-Child' dynamic by including himself in the state of need.",
    "ulterior_motives": "There is a slight psychological 'Bait and Switch' where the preacher uses the 'bad news' of Ecclesiastes to make the 'good news' of the Cross more palatable, but it is largely transparent.",

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The sermon avoids 'ITHY' (I'm Only Trying To Help You) because the preacher identifies as a fellow 'patient' in the hospital bed rather than a superior helper. He avoids 'NIGYSOB' by making the 'fault' (mortality/sin) a universal human condition rather than a specific failure of the audience."

    "congregation_position": "The congregation is invited to acknowledge their 'Victim' status (mortality/weakness) not as a permanent identity, but as a prerequisite for receiving grace.",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust because it utilizes the Adult ego state to dismantle the 'Adapted Child' requirements of a hyper-optimistic culture. By validating the reality of suffering and death (Adult), the preacher creates a safe space for the listener to drop their defenses. The transition to the Nurturing Parent (God's love) feels authentic because it does not bypass the reality of the human struggle. It avoids common homiletical games by maintaining transparency and shared vulnerability.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "Rejection of coercive 'Critical Parent' dynamics.",
      "High level of empathy and shared vulnerability."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The heavy focus on 'vanity' could risk triggering a 'Victim' loop if not balanced by the final hope.",
      "Slightly more 'Free Child' spontaneity could balance the somber realism."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' instead of 'you' when discussing judgment to maintain the Adult-Adult level and prevent the Drama Triangle from forming."
