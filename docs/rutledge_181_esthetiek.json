    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes strong, evocative imagery, particularly in the opening 'parent' analogy. By grounding the abstract doctrine of the Trinity in the visceral experience of a parent mortgaging a house or neglecting health for a child, the preacher follows Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' principle. The imagery of the 'last ditch of our messed-up lives' and the 'watchman straining for the dawn' provides sensory anchors. However, the second half of the text leans more heavily on liturgical and theological commentary, which slightly dilutes the consistent 'cinematic' quality found in the introduction. The metaphors are 'living' because they connect to universal human vulnerabilities rather than just religious tropes.",
      "quotes": [
        "Maybe he is hooked on drugs and failing in school, maybe she is anorexic and starving herself...",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise, reflecting McEntyre’s 'stewardship of language.' The preacher avoids 'Canaanite' jargon by defining terms through context. The critique of the Prayer Book revision ('there is no health in us') shows a deep concern for how specific words shape theology. There is a clear effort to distinguish between 'sentiment' and 'authentic emotion,' particularly in the Trinity section. The word choice is sophisticated yet accessible, avoiding the 'sloppy thinking' Grözinger warns against. Every adjective (e.g., 'crabbed, tumultuous, disjointed') is chosen to do specific work in characterizing the text of 2 Corinthians.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is crabbed, tumultuous, disjointed, wildly uneven.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The text exhibits a rhythmic cadence, particularly in the use of parallelisms and 'staccato' lists. The opening paragraph has a driving energy created by the repetition of 'maybe... maybe...' and 'you would... you would...'. This creates a 'legato' flow during the more reflective theological sections. It is clearly written for the ear, avoiding the 'paper language' of academic prose. The use of the Trinitarian formula as a recurring motif provides a musical 'refrain' that anchors the first section. The second section's rhythm is dictated by the liturgical quotes, which creates a more formal, stately pace.",

        "You would spend huge amounts of money... you would fly across the country; you would pay a ransom...",

        "The second prayer at the end is traditional but lacks the fresh rhythmic energy of the preacher's own prose.",
        "Could use more alliteration or assonance to make key theological points more 'sticky'."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Oral language; the structure is designed for performance and hearing."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The sermon demonstrates a high level of micro-aesthetic quality. It avoids the 'sober-drab' pitfall of some Reformed traditions by utilizing vivid, sometimes jarring, human analogies. The preacher treats language as a sacred trust, selecting descriptors that are both evocative and intellectually rigorous. The rhythm is particularly effective in the opening, creating a sense of urgency that mirrors the 'agonized' nature of the biblical text. It is a sophisticated blend of literary care and oral accessibility, successfully 'painting the picture' of grace through the lens of human desperation."
  },
  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon employs a 'Lowry-esque' movement, beginning with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' (the self-destructing child). This creates immediate tension. The movement from the 'agonized' Paul to the 'full Trinitarian blessing' serves as a narrative turning point. However, because the text is split into two separate reflections (Trinity and Psalm 130), the overall macro-arc is fragmented. The first half has a strong plot; the second half feels more like a thematic commentary. The 'energy' drops slightly when moving into the liturgical history of the Prayer Book, shifting from a 'journey' to a 'lecture'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Imagine for a moment that you are the parent of a child... on the verge of self-destruction.",
        "Paul was not being perfunctory after all. The church that was breaking his heart is the one that gets the full Trinitarian blessing.",
        "It begins at rock bottom: Out of the depths have I called to you."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The opening immediately 'hooks' the hearer with a high-stakes conflict.",
        "The 'reversal'—showing that the longest blessing is for the most 'broken' church—is a strong dramaturgical move.",
        "The conclusion of the first section provides a satisfying emotional resolution."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition between the Trinity reflection and the Psalm 130 reflection is non-existent in this text; it needs a bridge.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength. The preacher 'reframes' (Cilliers) the Trinity—often a dry, abstract doctrine—through the contemporary context of parental desperation and 'messed-up lives.' The integration of the '1976 Prayer Book' debate provides a specific cultural/ecclesial context that makes the theological point about sin concrete. The 'strangeness' of Paul’s erratic writing is honored rather than smoothed over, allowing the text to speak in its own 'crabbed' voice before applying it to the hearer's life. It successfully moves between 'then' and 'now' without being forced.",
      "quotes": [
        "Like a parent agonizing because a child has fallen in with a fast crowd, Paul will try almost any argument...",
        "The removal of this line has robbed us of a powerful buttress to the biblical concept of sin...",
        "Not just the bigots and thugs... but with all of us."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of the Trinity as 'self-giving love' rather than a mathematical puzzle.",
        "The use of the 'anorexic child' context makes the 'self-destruction' of sin palpable for a modern audience.",
        "Honors the 'inter-esse' (Cilliers) between the biblical world and the modern struggle."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The list of 'bigots, thugs, pimps' feels a bit dated/clichéd as a representation of 'the world'.",
        "Could integrate more 'reframing' of the Holy Spirit specifically, which remains the vaguest part of the Trinity here.",
        "The connection between the 'fear of the Lord' and modern life could be more explicitly 'reframed' for a secularized mind."

      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing; the Trinity is seen through the lens of 'desperate pursuit' rather than 'static being'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is 'open' in its acknowledgment of human pain and the 'messed-up' nature of life, avoiding 'kitsch' happy endings. It leaves room for the 'ambivalence of existence' by mentioning parents who fail their children. However, theologically, it is quite 'closed' or 'sealed' in its dogmatic assertions. While the preacher invites the hearer to 'reflect on your own life,' the conclusions are largely predetermined by the liturgical framework. It functions less as an 'opera aperta' (Stark) and more as a 'witness' (Long) that points to a fixed reality. The ending is an 'invocation' rather than an 'open question'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Some of us will have had parents who failed us.",
        "This is no dry scholarly doctrine... This is the love that upholds the universe.",
        "May God grant that not a single one of us today would think himself too good..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the 'depths' and 'catastrophe' without offering a 'cheap' resolution.",
        "The invitation to think of specific people in one's life creates a space for personal appropriation.",
        "Respects the 'mystery' of the Trinity by describing it as 'inexhaustible'."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The tone is occasionally authoritative to the point of closing down dialogue (e.g., 'This is the one thing we really need to know').",
        "The conclusion of the second section is a bit 'neat' with its 'joyous and liberating knowledge'.",
        "Could benefit from leaving a 'lingering question' to allow the hearer more interpretative agency."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent; a strong 'witness' that provides a clear frame rather than multiple entries."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The structural aesthetics are characterized by a powerful, narrative-driven opening that gradually transitions into a more traditional, didactic liturgical commentary. The 'reframing' of the Trinity is masterfully handled, moving the doctrine from the head to the heart. While the two sections are individually strong, the lack of a unified macro-arc between them (as presented) creates a fragmented experience. The sermon excels at 'witnessing' to a reality but is less 'open' as a work of art, preferring to lead the hearer to a specific, albeit profound, theological conclusion."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a strong antidote to religious kitsch. It explicitly rejects 'vague, romanticized versions of human love' and 'cheap comfort.' By describing Paul's letter as 'crabbed' and 'painful,' and by insisting on the 'vast primordial catastrophe' of sin, the preacher avoids the 'happy ending' cliché. The use of 'anorexia' and 'drug addiction' as metaphors for sin is a deliberate move away from 'sentimental' sin toward 'authentic' desperation. It sustains the tension of the 'depths' before moving to grace, which Cilliers identifies as the mark of true aesthetics. The only slight risk of kitsch is in the 'glimmer of radiance' metaphor, but it is anchored by the preceding 'failed parents' caveat.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential for the 'parental love' analogy to become sentimental is present, but the preacher checks this by mentioning parents who 'failed us'.",
      "The list of 'bigots and thugs' is a slightly clichéd way of defining 'the other's' sin."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of Paul's letter as 'almost too painful to read'—acknowledging the messiness of Scripture.",
      "The insistence on 'no health in us' as a path to true life, rather than a 'domesticated' idea of God."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the 'sharpness' of the human predicament; avoid the 'thugs and pimps' list in favor of more 'middle-class' or 'internal' examples of the 'primordial catastrophe' to keep the mirror focused on the congregation."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon effectively opens 'Space for Grace' by first creating a 'Space for Need.' By plumbing the 'depths' (Psalm 130) and the 'desperation' (2 Cor 13), the preacher makes the 'vertical' intervention of God’s grace feel necessary rather than optional. It avoids 'moralization' (the 'we must' trap) by focusing on God as the 'Someone' who pursues us. The Trinity is presented not as a rule to be believed, but as a 'dynamic interrelatedness' that 'pours itself out.' This creates a 'theocentric' space where God is the primary actor.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between human 'self-destruction' and Divine 'pursuit' is maintained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, the Trinity is treated as an 'inexhaustible Someone' rather than a solved puzzle.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the imperatives are minimal, the 'indicatives' of God's nature are central.",
    "recommendation": "To further open space, the preacher could allow for more 'silence' in the text—moments where the mystery is simply named and left to stand without immediate explanation."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon (or set of reflections) represents a high-quality example of 'Sober-Reformed' aesthetics infused with the 'New Homiletic's' emphasis on imagery. Its greatest strength lies in its 'stewardship of language' and its ability to 'reframe' difficult dogmatic concepts (Trinity, Total Depravity) into visceral human experiences. The preacher avoids the 'kitsch' of easy modern spirituality by insisting on the 'depths' of the human predicament, thereby making the 'Space for Grace' truly expansive. While the structure is somewhat fragmented and the tone is more 'authoritative witness' than 'open work of art,' the aesthetic impact is significant because the form (agonized, pursuit-oriented) mirrors the content (a God who pursues the broken). It is a 'transparent' sermon that draws attention not to its own 'beauty' but to the 'radiance' of its subject.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Visceral, non-sentimental imagery that grounds abstract doctrine.",
      "Precise, nuanced language that respects the 'strangeness' of the biblical text.",
      "Successful 'reframing' of the Trinity as a dynamic, self-giving relationship."

      "Create stronger dramaturgical bridges between thematic sections.",
      "Increase 'openness' by allowing more room for the hearer's own questions/ambivalence.",

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Poetic-Liturgical (A blend of high-church liturgical precision and vivid, narrative imagery).",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Thomas G. Long's 'Preacher as Witness' and Johan Cilliers' 'Reframing'.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'literate' hearers who value intellectual depth, liturgical tradition, and emotional honesty without sentimentality.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' to see how it affects the 'Space for Grace'.",
      "Use more 'sensory' details in the 'depths' section to match the 'parent' imagery of the first section.",
      "Focus on the 'musicality' of the second section to match the rhythmic drive of the first."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust piece of homiletical work. It avoids the 'aestheticism' of mere beautiful words by ensuring that every image and rhythmic turn serves the proclamation of the 'Three-Personed God.' It is a 'sober' beauty—one that does not shy away from the 'crabbed' and 'tumultuous' aspects of faith. By refusing to offer 'kitsch' comfort, it paradoxically provides a deeper, more 'authentic' consolation. It stands as a strong example of how the 'Aesthetic Turn' can deepen rather than distract from the Reformed focus on the Word."
