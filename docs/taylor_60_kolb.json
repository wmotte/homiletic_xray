This is the warp and woof, the lengthwise and cross threads of the fabric, the cloth of parental feeling toward children. There are many times in the rearing of a child when two almost opposite thoughts or words [...] When [we've] gone the last mile of the way, [We] will rest at the close of the day, And [we] know there are joys that await [us] When [we've] gone the last mile of the way.",

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a highly recognizable domestic situation (parenting) to ground the theological concept of human duality. It successfully facilitates identification by using common emotional experiences—the 'angel' and 'devil' moments in children. The preacher moves from this to the specific experience of being overlooked or ignored by 'important' people, which creates a strong emotional connection with the hearer's life world before introducing the biblical character of Matthew.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon pauses significantly to explore the 'why' of the human condition, specifically the internal conflict between 'lofty and low.' It provides a cultural and psychological analysis of why people are often 'battlefields within.' It identifies the problem of external influences (politics, media, advertising) that exploit this duality. However, the analysis of the 'tax collector' system is more historical-descriptive than deeply reflective on the 'why' of Matthew's personal choices.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is a parable of life: we humans are queer mixtures of angels and devils, all housed in the same dwelling place.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The theological exposition centers on the 'Big Idea' that Jesus sees the 'hero' (the imago Dei) where others see 'trash.' While the exegesis of Matthew 9:9 is present, it is relatively thin on technical detail, focusing more on the character of Jesus than the mechanics of the text. The dogmatic deepening regarding the 'godlikeness' versus 'devilry' is clear but remains more metaphorical than systematic-theological.",
      "quotes": [
        "He appealed in short to the godlikeness in us, not to the devil in us.",

While there is a strong 'invitation' to follow and a description of what the 'way' looks like (rocky but guided), there are few concrete action steps for the hearer's Monday-to-Saturday life. The call is more to an internal disposition of 'going on' rather than specific ethical or practical implementations of the 'heroic' appeal in the community.",

The preacher successfully establishes a recognizable human condition (the split self) and provides a compelling theological vision of Christ's redemptive gaze. The use of hymnody and personal testimony at the end reinforces the 'visionary' and 'narrative' aspects but leaves the 'pragmatic' needs of the hearer largely unmet. It is a sermon of high emotional and imaginative impact, but lower practical-ethical specificity.",

    "conclusion": "The sermon is a highly effective piece of visionary and narrative homiletics that successfully completes the first three phases of Kolb's cycle. It excels in creating an emotional 'Concrete Experience' and providing a 'Reflective Observation' of the human struggle. However, from a Kolb perspective, it is incomplete due to the lack of 'Active Experimentation.' The preacher successfully moves the 'heart' and the 'eyes,' but leaves the 'hands' without specific direction. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the grand vision of 'following the King' and the mundane realities of daily ethical living."
