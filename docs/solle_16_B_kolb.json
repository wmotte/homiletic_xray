    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a strong emotional 'hook' based on indignation. It facilitates experience by naming specific, recognizable figures and groups (Dom Helder Camara, base communities). It touches the hearer through empathy for the marginalized and anger toward institutional injustice. However, it remains somewhat 'representative'—it describes the experiences of others (the poor in Colombia, women in the church) rather than directly engaging the immediate sensory experience of the listener in the room.",
      "quotes": [
        "Was mich am meisten an der gegenwärtigen Leitung der römischen Kirche empört...",

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a core strength of the sermon. The preacher pauses at the 'why' of the situation, offering a deep psychological and sociological critique of church power. It analyzes underlying patterns such as 'institutional sexism' and 'male neuroses.' It looks at the problem from the perspective of the 'Other' and critiques the method of church governance (the USA pastoral letter example). It avoids premature solutions by dwelling on the 'death' of the system.",
      "quotes": [

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The theological exposition is present but serves the polemic. The 'big idea' is the contrast between the 'Spirit' (Ruach) and the 'System.' While it quotes Ezekiel and Luther, the exegesis is more illustrative than foundational. The theological framework is that of Liberation Theology (God's perspective is that of the powerless). However, the logical development of the biblical text itself is secondary to the critique of the institution.",

      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. The sermon is high on 'what is wrong' and 'what ought to be,' but low on 'how should we respond' in a concrete, local sense. It calls for a 'new Reformation' and for the Spirit to blow, but offers few specific action steps for the individual hearer beyond 'hope' and 'raising one's voice.' The application remains largely at the level of macro-ecclesial politics.",
      "quotes": [

    "summary": "This sermon is a powerful example of prophetic-political preaching that excels in the first half of Kolb's cycle (Experience and Reflection). It effectively uses indignation as a gateway to a sophisticated systemic critique of institutional power. The preacher successfully identifies the 'death' of a system and contrasts it with the 'life' of the Spirit, using vivid metaphors and contemporary examples. However, the sermon falls short in the 'Pragmatic' and 'Active Experimentation' phases. It provides a diagnosis but lacks a therapy that the immediate congregation can participate in. The learning process is one of 'consciousness-raising' (conscientization) rather than 'equipping for service.' It serves the 'Diverging' and 'Assimilating' learners well but leaves the 'Converging' learner without a clear path forward. The biblical text of Ezekiel 37 is used more as a poetic coda than as a foundational text for exegesis throughout the sermon.",

    "conclusion": "The sermon is a strong, sober diagnostic of ecclesial crisis, functioning primarily in the 'Visionary' and 'Interpretive' modes. From a Kolb perspective, it is an incomplete cycle: it awakens the heart and informs the mind but fails to mobilize the hands. While its critique is intellectually and emotionally robust, its homiletical effectiveness is limited by its lack of pragmatic application. It is an excellent example of 'conscientization' but requires a more balanced approach to facilitate holistic adult learning."
