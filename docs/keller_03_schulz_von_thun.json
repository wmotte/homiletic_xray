    "sermon_start_end": "The Bible says that when we become Christians we don’t just turn over a new leaf. We’re spiritually raised with Christ, it says in Ephesians 2. In Philippians 3, Paul says, “I want to know the power of his resurrection.” Jesus Christ’s resurrection power comes into our lives. [...] To the degree you see what your sin cost him, to that degree you will be holy. In the Old Testament God’s holiness is awesome, but in the New Testament God’s holiness in Jesus Christ giving himself away is gorgeous. So look at it until it makes you holy. Let’s pray.",
    "notes": "The sermon utilizes a classic expository structure with a strong emphasis on linguistic and historical-cultural context (Leviticus)."

  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a robust exegetical framework by linking Peter's call to holiness back to the Levitical roots of 'separateness'. The 'blue' side is dominated by the distinction between mere morality and ontological belonging. By using the metaphor of the 'holy table' versus the 'moral table', the preacher successfully clarifies a complex theological concept. The factual content is not merely data-driven but serves to redefine the listener's vocabulary (sin, holiness, sanctification). However, the transition from the Old Testament cultic purity to New Testament ethics is handled with a broad brush, potentially oversimplifying the continuity of the Law for the sake of the 'belonging' argument.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Hebrew word originally means separate, set apart.",
        "Leviticus is not talking so much about holy people... It’s talking about holy things.",
        "In Jesus Christ all those laws about what you eat, how you dress... have been all fulfilled."

      "strengths": [
        "Clear etymological explanation of 'Kadosh' (separateness).",

        "Could provide more nuance on the 'impartial judgment' mentioned in verse 17.",
        "The connection between 'sober minds' and 'scholarship' is a slight intellectual stretch."

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The preacher uses everyday analogies (New Yorkers, Christmas cards) to ground high-level dogmatics."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as an intellectual mediator—one who values 'thinking' as a spiritual discipline. There is a clear 'leak' of intellectualism; the preacher identifies with the 'scholar' type (sober, reflective). The 'I' is largely diaconal, appearing mostly to facilitate the text's logic rather than for personal catharsis. However, there is a subtle 'Compulsive' (Riemann) trait in the insistence on 'thinking out implications' and 'careful definitions'. The preacher reveals a slight frustration with 'typical New Yorkers' and 'ironic' culture, showing his own position as a serious counter-cultural voice.",
      "quotes": [
        "I’ve had many people say to me, 'Oh, you’re admitting...'",
        "It’s actually a word that would characterize the mindset of a scholar.",
        "I’m not going to give you a full-throated understanding..."

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive/Schizoid blend. The focus is on structural clarity, logic, and the 'sober' mind, maintaining a professional distance while seeking cognitive correctness.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is subservient. Personal anecdotes (wife/children) are used strictly as illustrative tools for the 'Sache'.",

    },
    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching/Pedagogical'. The preacher speaks as an authoritative guide who understands the 'modern culture' better than the culture understands itself. There is a 'solidary' element when he includes himself in the struggle ('when you and I think of holiness'), but the dominant tone is 'from above'—the expert explaining the 'real' meaning to the 'ignorant' or 'ironic' listener. The use of 'New Yorker' as a foil creates an 'us vs. them' dynamic that might alienate a seeker but strengthens the identity of the 'in-group'.",
      "quotes": [
        "I want to show you it means a lot more than that.",
        "If you talk to a typical New Yorker...",

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon performs a classic Barthian/Lutheran move: it grounds the 'Anspruch' (demand) in the 'Zuspruch' (promise). The appeal is not 'be moral to be saved' but 'you belong to God, therefore live out that reality'. The preacher successfully avoids moralism by redefining holiness as a response to 'precious blood' rather than a checklist. However, the appeal to 'Think!' is very strong and almost becomes a new law—the duty to be intellectually rigorous as a prerequisite for peace.",
      "quotes": [
        "Think! It’s a lack of thinking that gives you a lack of peace.",
        "You are not your own; you were bought at a price.",
        "Look at it until it makes you holy."

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Strong. The 'Gift' (Redemption/Belonging) clearly precedes the 'Task' (Holy Living).",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Low, due to the emphasis on 'delight' and 'belonging' over 'rules'.",
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant use of the David/Water story to illustrate 'devotion beyond command'.",
        "Christocentric conclusion."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The appeal to 'think' could be better integrated with the 'heart' to avoid intellectual exhaustion.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is a sophisticated exercise in homiletical 're-education'. The preacher systematically dismantles the modern, 'ironic' understanding of holiness and replaces it with a Barthian/Immink-influenced theology of 'belonging'. By focusing on the 'Blue' side (Factual/Theological), he provides the congregation with a new mental map. The transition from the 'Red' side (Appeal) of Law to the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) of the Gospel is handled with skill, particularly in the final section where Christ’s 'sanctifying himself' becomes the engine for the believer's holiness. Psychologically, the sermon leans heavily on the 'Compulsive' need for clarity and logic, which serves the 'Sache' (the living Christ) well but may leave the 'Relationship Ear' somewhat hungry for more immediate, affective connection. The 'Barthian Test' is passed: God remains the Acting Subject who 'buys' the believer, preventing the sermon from sliding into a 'self-help' psychological manual. It is a strong, 'Ample Satisfactory' performance that respects the intelligence of the hearer while maintaining the primacy of the Gospel.",
    "barthian_warning": "The preacher avoids psychologization by grounding 'peace' in objective 'thinking' about Gospel facts rather than subjective 'experiences'.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological precision in defining holiness.",
      "Excellent use of narrative (David) to illustrate internal motivation.",
      "Clear grounding of ethics in the 'precious blood' (Gospel)."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Softening the 'Relationship' tone to be less 'Teaching-from-above'.",
      "Greater emphasis on the role of the Holy Spirit (not just the 'Mind') in transformation.",
      "More vulnerability in the 'Green' side to balance the 'Scholar' persona."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A theologically sound and communicatively clear sermon that prioritizes the 'Sache' of the Gospel over the ego of the preacher."
