    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically complex. It avoids the 'I'm Only Trying to Help You' trap by refusing to offer easy solutions to the church's crisis. However, it leans heavily on the Critical Parent to establish authority, using 'God's wrath' as a tool to induce a state of Adapted Child compliance/fear in the listeners. The use of Lincoln provides a healthy Adult 'reality check' that prevents the sermon from becoming a pure 'NIGYSOB' game against theological opponents.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult ego engagement through historical and intellectual rigor.",
      "Avoids simplistic 'Rescuer' promises.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "High reliance on 'Fear' (CP) as a motivational tool.",
      "The 'Alien Work' concept can be used to justify any hardship, potentially keeping listeners in a 'Victim' role.",
      "Lack of 'Free Child' joy or hope."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward game-free communication, the preacher could invite more FC spontaneity by focusing on the 'new thing' God is creating, rather than just the 'destruction' He is decreeing. Reducing the 'Ain't it Awful' framing of the church's state would also empower the listeners' Adult ego."
