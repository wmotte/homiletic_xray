    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. It utilizes a Parent-Child dynamic to induce a sense of spiritual inadequacy ('babes in Christ') before offering a Rescuer. While theologically traditional, it reinforces a 'Victim' stance in the listener, suggesting that personal agency ('decision, determination') is useless. This can lead to a 'learned helplessness' where the believer remains in the 'Adapted Child' position indefinitely.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Address the congregation as 'Adults' capable of making choices. Instead of saying 'We cannot do this,' frame the spiritual life as an Adult partnership with the Divine, emphasizing competence and present-moment responsibility rather than nursery-level dependency."
