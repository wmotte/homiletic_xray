      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's primary formal requirement. It does not actualize one specific Bible passage but uses Scripture as a repository for a thematic exploration of 'bread'. It jumps from the Psalms to 2 Kings to Mark. It treats 'bread' as a biblical keyword or idea, which Dekker explicitly states is not a sermon.",

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exposition of the original context is superficial. While the preacher mentions the 'arid Near East' and the 'lepers in the enemy camp', these are used as illustrative backdrops rather than rigorous exegesis of what the text meant for its first readers. The theological depth of the biblical books is largely bypassed for metaphorical application.",

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part but remains somewhat 'general' in its academic framing. It addresses the 'zeitgeist' of the academic guild and the economy. However, it risks becoming a 'speech about refugees/economy' which Dekker warns against if not rooted in a specific text's unique contribution.",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is more of a thematic essay than an interwoven exposition. The text is used to support the application (the 'agenda'), rather than the hearer being drawn into the text to be 'expounded' by it. The 'present of revelation' is obscured by the preacher's own thematic structure.",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The 'three parts' are present but unbalanced. 'Misery' is framed as hunger or academic 'forgetting', and 'redemption' is the 'Sunday mystery' of abundance. However, it leans toward an 'objective' or 'social' gospel rather than the Trinitarian, human-oriented preaching Dekker describes. The 'misery before God' is under-addressed.",

      "findings": "The 'two ways' are hinted at through the 'leaven of the Pharisees' and the 'empire', but the ultimate seriousness of being 'lost' (temporal or eternal) is softened into academic accountability. The stakes feel professional rather than existential/eternal.",

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, particularly in the final section. The sermon correctly identifies Christ as the one who blesses and breaks. However, the 'doctrine of the two natures' is not felt; Christ appears more as a 'manager' of new governance than the ontological Savior outside of man.",

      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1,150 words, the sermon would take 11-12 minutes to deliver. According to Dekker (Thesis 8), this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for true homiletical 'depth'. It is a 'homily' or 'speech', not a sermon.",
      "quotes": [

    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text falls short of Dekker's definition of a sermon primarily because it lacks a single, specific biblical passage as its foundation, opting instead for a thematic 'keyword' approach ('bread'). It is too short (approx. 11 minutes) to achieve the necessary depth. While it offers strong social and economic application, it lacks the rigorous linguistic exposition and the existential weight of the 'two ways'.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application to the specific 'guild' (academic/researchers) of the audience.",
      "Effective use of the 'misery' of hunger and the 'gratitude' of abundance as a framework.",
      "Clear identification of Christ as the ultimate telos of the 'bread business'."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Violation of Thesis 1: It is a thematic speech about 'bread', not an exposition of a specific pericope.",
      "Insufficient length: At 11 minutes, it lacks the 'breadth' required for 'depth'.",
      "Softening of the 'two ways': The seriousness of being 'lost' is reduced to professional or social failure."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate academic homily or 'speech about the gospel', but according to Dekker's strict criteria, it is not a sermon. It lacks the specific scriptural grounding and the necessary duration to function as the 'Word of God' in the sense of actualized revelation."
