        "analysis": "The preacher avoids 'shaming' the congregation for their regrets or 'sins.' Instead of moralizing, he frames human failure as a universal 'predicament.' The CP only appears briefly when describing the 'Jewish rites' as ineffective, but it is directed at ritual, not the listener.",
        "quotes": [
          "If you are too young to know this feeling, don’t worry, you’ll get there sooner or later.",

      "presence": "High",

        "analysis": "The preacher does not speak from a place of seeking approval or fear of the institution. He models vulnerability (Free Child) rather than the compliance of an Adapted Child.",

  "transaction_analysis": {
    "primary_transaction_style": "Adult -> Adult (with NP support)",
    "analysis": "The preacher initiates an Adult-to-Adult transaction by analyzing common human experiences (regret, ads, weddings). He then moves to a Nurturing Parent to Child transaction only to offer 'permission' for joy and relief, rather than to demand obedience.",

    "risk_explanation": "The only slight 'double bottom' is the use of the personal ad to hook the listener's 'Child' (longing), but this is used for illustration rather than entrapment."

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The sermon avoids 'ITHY' (I'm Only Trying To Help You) by not offering a 'quick fix' or blaming the listener for the wine running out. It avoids 'NIGYSOB' by identifying with the congregation's regret rather than judging it. It avoids 'Ain't It Awful' by moving past the cultural critique into a theological promise of abundance."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in homiletics. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, using logic and cultural observation to validate the human experience of 'regret.' By avoiding the Critical Parent, the preacher creates a safe space for the listener's Free Child to experience the 'abundance' of the Gospel. The preacher avoids the Drama Triangle by refusing to play the Rescuer; he instead acts as a witness to the 'Sign' of Cana.",

      "High level of Adult-to-Adult transparency.",
      "Authentic vulnerability in the introduction.",
      "Avoidance of moralistic 'shame' cycles."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the 'secular' regret to the 'religious' solution is very smooth, which could potentially mask the complexity of psychological grief.",
      "Briefly risks 'Ain't It Awful' when discussing 'affluent America,' though it recovers quickly."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements and shared human experiences. To maintain this level of health, ensure that the 'abundance' promised isn't used as a way to bypass (spiritual bypass) the very real Adult work of addressing life's regrets."
