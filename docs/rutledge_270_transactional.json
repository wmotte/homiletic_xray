    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a rare example of high psychological health in a homiletic context. It avoids the common 'Nurturing Parent' trap of over-sentimentalizing Christmas and the 'Critical Parent' trap of demanding blind faith. By operating from the Adult ego state, the preacher respects the listener's intelligence and emotional boundaries. He uses 'unblinking' reality-testing to address the problem of evil, creating a space for authentic Free Child lament rather than forced Adapted Child 'joy.'",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of Adult-to-Adult transparency.",

      "The intensity of the 'Critical Parent' descriptions of Herod could potentially trigger a fear response in very sensitive listeners, though it is used for diagnostic purposes."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to model the 'Adult' struggle with faith. By showing your own 'Adult' processing of 'Child' fears and 'Parental' dogmas, you give the congregation permission to do the same."
