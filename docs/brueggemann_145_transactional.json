    "summary": "This sermon is a model of psychologically healthy communication. By using the 'Adult' ego state to analyze 'pronouns,' the preacher bypasses the typical Parent-Child power dynamics of the pulpit. The sermon promotes autonomy by defining the 'We' as a group with agency ('doing Easters') rather than a group that simply receives. It avoids the Drama Triangle by situating the 'Rescuer' role in the 'I' of Jesus and the 'You' of God, while inviting the congregation into a healthy, collaborative 'We'. The transition from the comfort of Psalm 23 to the challenge of 1 John is handled without a 'Switch' to the Persecutor role, maintaining a consistent tone of invitation.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Free Child' element could be slightly more integrated throughout, rather than just appearing at the end.",
      "Briefly acknowledging the 'Adapted Child's' struggle with these pronouns might deepen the empathy."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using objective frameworks (like grammar or history) to engage the listener's Adult. This prevents the sermon from sliding into a Critical Parent 'lecture' and keeps the psychological 'contract' transparent."
