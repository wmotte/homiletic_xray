    "sermon_start_end": "The symbolism of night and darkness pervades the Gospel of John. At the very beginning we hear the proclamation that the light of the incarnate Word of God comes to shine in the darkness (1:5). Repeatedly in this gospel, Jesus teaches that he brings light to the world [...] The message of the resurrection is indeed too wonderful for us. Flesh and blood cannot inherit it. It is grasped only by faith. Through the Word of God the Holy Spirit creates such faith in those who gladly hear the message."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher selects specific pericopes, yet the analysis treats them somewhat as thematic illustrations for 'darkness' or 'doubt' rather than extracting what is unique to *this* text alone. The connection to the specific Johannine detail of the 'linen cloths' is a strong attempt at specificity.",
      "quotes": [
        "No grave robber would stop to unwrap the winding sheet. Jesus’s body had simply passed through them."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the 'unique' element of the text more sharply. For instance, in the Job text, focus more on why the whirlwind specifically—and not just 'God'—is the unique revelatory mode of this passage."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher shows awareness of the Johannine 'dramatist' and Jewish burial customs. However, there is no evidence of Greek or Hebrew engagement as Dekker requires. The exegesis remains at a literary-thematic level.",
      "quotes": [
        "They bound the body tightly with the spices wrapped in linen bands, 'as is the burial custom of the Jews'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate deeper linguistic or historical-critical insights to justify the 'exposition' requirement, particularly regarding the 'two ways' or the nature of the 'Word' in the original language."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is concrete and avoids generalities. The use of the Piedmont tornado example and the friend's daughter's ashes provides the 'psychological' and 'sociological' weight Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "A man looked at the little patent-leather Easter shoes of the children lying in the ruins and said, 'If that don’t shake your faith, nothing will.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the application more to the 'zeitgeist' of collective modern life (e.g., secularism) rather than only individual tragedies."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon moves back and forth between the text and the experience of the hearer. It avoids the 'block' structure (15 min exegesis, 5 min application), but the transitions are sometimes abrupt.",
      "quotes": [
        "Have you buried someone? If you haven’t, you will... This, in part, is what John’s Gospel means by night."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'present' of revelation is more seamless so that the text itself 'expounds' the hearer's life simultaneously."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "The sermon is very strong on 'misery' (the night, the tornado, the dust). It correctly identifies misery as 'misery before God.' Redemption is clearly outside the self.",
      "quotes": [
        "The realm of darkness appears to be victorious. There is nothing left of the Messiah but the grave.",
        "comforted that I am dust."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The 'gratitude' (sanctification/ethics) part is slightly underdeveloped compared to the weight of misery and redemption."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "This is the weakest point. While 'being lost' in grief is addressed, the ultimate seriousness of the 'two ways' (eternal or temporal destruction) is softened into a 'choice' of gods rather than a life-and-death destination.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have a real choice. We can choose a god who suits us... or the Bible sets before us a baffling... God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'narrow way' and 'broad way' more explicitly. The possibility of being truly 'lost' must be more than just feeling sad or having a wrong concept of God."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon emphasizes the two-natures (God entering pain) and grace as the only source of life.",
      "quotes": [
        "The living Son of God had appeared to him personally.",
        "Man has no life in himself, it is Christ who is his life."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure that Christ is not just a 'solution' to the problem of Job but the 'telos' of the entire Old Testament narrative in a more integrated way."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The total word count suggests a duration of over 20 minutes, allowing for the 'breadth' Miskotte and Dekker demand. The depth is achieved through the refusal of easy answers.",
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this length but increase the 'theological density' in the middle sections."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon series is strong in its refusal of 'general truths' and its deep engagement with human misery. It succeeds in making the Bible passage current. However, it falls short of Dekker's standard regarding the 'two ways' and the technical requirements of Hebrew/Greek exposition. The application is concrete but leans heavily on individual/psychological tragedy rather than the broader cultural/political zeitgeist.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application using specific, harrowing examples (Piedmont tornado).",
      "Strong emphasis on the 'misery' of the human condition (dust, night).",
      "Christ is the clear theological telos and the source of grace."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of explicit 'two ways' theology; the seriousness of being 'lost' is under-thematized.",
      "Absence of original language exegesis as a basis for authority.",
      "The 'unique' element of the specific text is sometimes overshadowed by broader themes (e.g., 'light vs dark')."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a substantial sermon that treats the Word of God with seriousness. It is not a 'speech about ideas' but a genuine attempt at exposition and application. To fully meet Dekker's ideal, it requires a sharper edge regarding the 'two ways' and a more rigorous academic-exegetical foundation."
