    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily as a didactic tool rather than a poetic immersion. The 'coach' metaphor is the central image, effectively translating the abstract 'kingdom' into a contemporary power dynamic. While functional, it lacks sensory depth. The 'house on the rock' imagery from the text is handled with more weight, but the preacher often retreats into abstract categories (power, success, recognition). The 'paper clipping' anecdote provides a rare tactile moment. According to Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell,' the sermon leans heavily toward 'telling' (explaining the meaning of images) rather than 'showing' (letting the image speak for itself). The imagery serves the logic, not the imagination.",
      "quotes": [
        "We don’t have kings, but we do have coaches... that coach is a king.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Predominantly 'tell'. The preacher explains the mechanics of the kingdom through the coach metaphor rather than evoking the atmosphere of the kingdom through narrative."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and demonstrates high 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre). The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by defining terms like 'woe' and 'laugh' (gloating) with linguistic nuance. There is a clear effort to distinguish between 'middle class in spirit' and 'poor in spirit,' which provides a sharp, diagnostic clarity. The vocabulary is sophisticated yet accessible, avoiding the 'sloppy thinking' Grözinger warns against. Every word serves the clarification of the concept. The distinction between 'cursed' and 'alas for you' shows a deep respect for the original text's emotional and semantic range.",
      "quotes": [
        "This word laugh is a Greek word that means to gloat.",
        "What is a middle class in spirit person? Spiritually, what does it mean to be middle class?",

        "The repetition of 'What it is, what it’s not' is effective but borders on a textbook style.",

        "Could benefit from more 'loving language' (McEntyre) to soften the analytical sharpness."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Minimal jargon. Theological terms like 'justification' and 'sanctification' are either avoided or grounded in the 'reversal' narrative."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is written in a conversational, 'oral' style, but it lacks poetic cadence or rhetorical musicality. The rhythm is that of a lecture—logical, punctuated by 'Now,' 'Secondly,' and 'Lastly.' There is little use of alliteration, parallelism, or evocative staccato/legato shifts. The flow is determined by the 'points' rather than an aesthetic or emotional arc. While it 'listens' easily because of its clarity, it does not 'sing.' It is 'paper language' in the sense of a well-organized outline, though it is clearly intended for oral delivery. The final quote from Calvin provides the only moment of elevated, rhythmic prose.",
      "quotes": [
        "What it is, what it’s not, what it’s like, how you enter it...",
        "First, you have to be poor in spirit. Secondly, if you are truly poor in spirit...",

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Oral language, but specifically 'didactic-oral'. It sounds like a teacher, not a poet."
    },
    "average_score_language": 6.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is a model of clarity and precision, reflecting a high degree of stewardship. It excels in defining complex theological concepts for a modern audience without falling into jargon. However, it lacks the 'poetic power' advocated by Grözinger. The imagery is functional and cognitive rather than sensory or evocative. The musicality is sacrificed for the sake of logical transparency. It is an aesthetically 'sober' language—transparent toward the message but perhaps too clinical to fully engage the aesthetic imagination."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The structure is a classic, static five-point movement. While the preacher calls it a 'journey,' it functions more as an analytical breakdown. There is no 'upsetting of the equilibrium' (Lowry) in the opening; it begins with a methodological explanation. The tension is intellectual (the 'strangeness' of the Beatitudes) rather than narrative. The turning point (Point 4: How you enter it) is theologically strong—the 'Great Reversal' of the Cross—but it feels like another item on a list rather than a dramatic climax. The energy is consistent but lacks the 'ebb and flow' of a true performance event (Immink).",
      "quotes": [
        "What we’re doing each week is taking one phrase and going to someplace in the Bible...",
        "I want to show you what the kingdom of God is, what it’s not, what it’s like...",
        "Lastly, praying 'Thy kingdom come' is to hope, to look to the future."

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. The 'reframing' (Cilliers) of the Beatitudes through the lens of New York City's 'kingdom of power' is masterful. The preacher respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the woes) and uses it to challenge the hearer’s cultural frames. The synthesis of the 'middle class in spirit' with the biblical 'poor' is a creative act of reframing that makes the ancient text feel immediate. The context (NYC, movie stars, careerism) is not just an 'add-on' but is deeply integrated into the theological argument. It offers a new 'optics' for looking at one's own success and failure.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now this is New York City, and we are the capital of the kingdom of this world.",
        "If you’re a true Christian... you will know you didn’t pull yourself up by your bootstrap.",

      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of the Beatitudes against the backdrop of urban meritocracy.",
        "The 'middle class in spirit' concept is a powerful contextualization of 'poor in spirit'.",
        "The sermon successfully bridges the 'then' and 'now' without smoothing over the text's radicality."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Could include more specific 'local' examples of the kingdom of God appearing in the city.",

      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing. It shifts the hearer's perspective from 'moral effort' to 'spiritual bankruptcy/grace'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is quite 'closed' in its didacticism. It functions as a 'closed system of truths' (Stark) where the preacher provides all the definitions and applications. While the 'four levels' of the kingdom are insightful, they leave little room for the hearer's own interpretation or 'polyvalence.' However, the sermon avoids being 'moralistic' in the sense of a 'to-do list.' By focusing on the 'Great Reversal' of the Cross, it opens a space for the hearer to exist within God's grace. The ending, while structured, invites the hearer into a 'joyful remembrance,' which is a more open, contemplative posture.",
      "quotes": [
        "I want to show you what the kingdom of God is...",
        "There are four groups that are blessed... Then there are four groups Jesus pronounces a woe on.",
        "I don’t know what you’re going to do on Friday. Be innovative."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Avoids a 'coercive' moralism by grounding the application in the work of Christ.",
        "The 'innovation' comment at the end gives a small nod to the hearer's agency.",
        "Acknowledges the 'partial' nature of the kingdom, allowing for the 'not yet' of existence."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Ask more rhetorical questions that don't have immediate answers.",
        "Leave some of the 'woes' or 'blessings' to resonate without exhaustive explanation.",
        "Allow for more 'ambivalence' in the experience of the 'already/not yet' kingdom."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly monovalent. It is an 'instructive work' more than an 'open work of art'."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is intellectually rigorous and highly integrated with the context. The 'reframing' of the text within the culture of New York City is the sermon's aesthetic highlight. However, the dramaturgy is overly linear and didactic, following a rigid five-point plan that prioritizes information over transformation. It lacks the 'narrative arc' that creates emotional tension. It is a 'closed' work that seeks to explain the mystery rather than invite the hearer into it, though it successfully avoids the trap of simple moralism."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'pre-chewed emotions' and 'cheap comfort.' By emphasizing the 'woes' and the 'disillusionment' of success (the Cynthia Heimel quote), it takes the 'pain of existence' seriously. It does not offer a 'happy ending' based on human effort but points to a 'rotten practical joke' of worldly success. The emotion is 'authentic' because it is tied to the harsh reality of spiritual bankruptcy. There is no sentimentality here; the 'blessedness' is described as something that involves weeping and being hated. It is a 'sober' aesthetic that refuses to 'beautify' the radical demands of the Gospel.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None identified; the sermon actively deconstructs kitsch-like 'happy' Christianity.",
      "The 'coach' metaphor is close to being a cliché, but is handled with enough irony to avoid kitsch."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the movie stars' disillusionment as 'howling and insufferable'.",
      "The 'middle class in spirit' diagnosis which cuts through religious superficiality."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of cultural critique; it is the best defense against religious kitsch."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'Great Reversal' (Point 4). By showing that Jesus took the 'woes' so we could have the 'blessings,' the preacher moves from 'law' to 'gospel.' The tension between the 'already' and 'not yet' is sustained (Cilliers). However, the highly structured, didactic nature of the sermon occasionally 'closes' the space by making grace feel like a logical conclusion to an argument rather than a surprising encounter. The 'mystery' of God is somewhat tamed by the 'four levels' and 'four things to keep in mind,' yet the core message remains centered on the 'unavailable' gift of God.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between worldly success and spiritual poverty is held throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "Moderately; the preacher tends to explain the mystery, but the final prayer points back to the 'final rising' as a future hope.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. Even the 'obedience' section is framed as a response to the 'foundation' of Jesus' love.",
    "recommendation": "Allow for more 'silence' or 'wonder' in the text—less explanation, more proclamation of the 'Space for Grace'."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.7,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a 'Sober-Reformed' aesthetic that prioritizes clarity, intellectual precision, and contextual reframing. Its greatest strength lies in its ability to take a familiar biblical text and 'reframe' it against the dominant cultural narratives of power and success, effectively avoiding religious kitsch. The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long) to the 'Great Reversal' of the Cross. However, from an aesthetic standpoint, the sermon is heavily weighted toward the cognitive. The 'Poetics of Language' are functional rather than evocative, and the 'Dramaturgy of Structure' is more akin to a classroom lecture than a liturgical event. It is an 'aesthetics of the mind'—it convinces and clarifies, but it rarely 'paints' or 'sings.' The sermon opens space for grace by deconstructing human merit, but then partially closes it through an exhaustive, monovalent structure that leaves little room for the 'open work of art.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful contextual 'reframing' of the Beatitudes for a modern urban audience.",
      "High degree of linguistic precision and 'stewardship of language'.",
      "Complete avoidance of religious kitsch and sentimentalism."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase sensory imagery ('show, don't tell') to engage the imagination.",
      "Develop a more dynamic narrative arc to move beyond a static five-point list.",
      "Incorporate more 'open' rhetorical elements to allow for hearer appropriation."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Analytical-Reframing (Sober-Reformed)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Witness' model of Thomas Long, but lacks the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'urban intellectuals' and those who value logical coherence and cultural relevance over emotional fervor.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a 'Lowry Loop' structure to create more narrative tension.",
      "Use one central, deeply sensory image that recurs throughout the sermon.",
      "End with an open-ended story or image rather than a four-point prayer guide."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically 'good' (6.7) example of practical-theological communication. It excels in the 'Ethics of the Word' through its precision and lack of kitsch. It successfully 'reframes' reality in the light of the Gospel. However, it remains a 'work of the head.' To reach the level of an 'aesthetic model' (8+), it would need to embrace the 'poetic power' of language and a more 'performative' dramaturgy that allows the 'Holy to happen' in the space between the words, rather than just in the explanation of them."
