    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes the central metaphor of 'The Knocker' with significant evocative power. Taylor moves beyond the static image of Holman Hunt’s painting to a dynamic, spatial metaphor of the 'inner house,' detailing specific rooms (parlor, dining room, bedroom, playroom). This spatial imagery serves to concretize the abstract concept of 'heart' into lived experience. The imagery of the 'back pasture of Horeb' and the 'burning bush' provides a cinematic backdrop for the theological transition from the hidden God to the knocking Christ. While the metaphors are largely biblical and traditional, they are revitalized through Taylor's rhythmic delivery and sensory associations (stench of the brick-yard vs. the Rose of Sharon).",

        "If we have let him in the parlor, he wants to come into the dining room where the food and drink are.",
        "Moses stood there, tending his father-in-law's sheep, and the Lord came to him.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Taylor exhibits a high degree of stewardship over language, particularly in his handling of theological paradoxes (the 'Door' knocking at the door). He avoids dense academic jargon, opting instead for a 'sober beauty' that resonates with his congregation. However, the sermon contains a significant digression regarding 'male models' and 'mothering' that, while socially relevant, disrupts the linguistic precision of the primary homiletical theme. The language is loving and pastoral, yet it occasionally relies on repetitive 'Canaanite' phrasing toward the end, which slightly obscures the sharp precision of the opening move.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Door is now knocking at the door.",
        "God started saying who he was and would not tell Moses all that he was.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest micro-aesthetic strength. Taylor employs classical rhetorical figures—specifically anaphora ('This is...', 'I am...') and epistrophe—to create a powerful cadence. The rhythm mimics the very 'knocking' he describes. The variation in sentence length creates a 'staccato' effect that builds urgency. The movement from the 'Am what?' question to the rhythmic 'I am' declarations demonstrates a mastery of oral performance where the sound of the words reinforces the weight of the revelation. It is clearly language written for the ear, not the eye.",

        "Knocking. Knocking.",
        "This is the end of the prophets knocking at your door. This is the fulfillment of the whole Bible knocking at your door.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a rhythmic, 'musical' quality typical of the African American pulpit tradition. Taylor excels at 'reframing' the biblical text through vivid spatial imagery and a masterful use of anaphora. While he occasionally slips into traditional religious clichés toward the conclusion, his stewardship of language remains high. The sermon is a performance of sound as much as meaning, where the word 'knocking' becomes a percussive element that drives the theological point home. The micro-aesthetics are strong, though slightly marred by a thematic digression."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a clear 'upsetting of the equilibrium' by reversing the seeker/sought dynamic. Taylor introduces a 'problem'—the elusive God of our youth—and resolves it with the 'Knocking God.' However, the narrative arc is interrupted by a substantial Father's Day 'parenthesis' about role models. This creates a 'broken' arc where the tension built in the introduction is dissipated before being reconstructed in the second half. The 'turning point' is the completion of the 'I Am' sentence from Horeb, which provides a satisfying theological climax, but the movement toward the end feels more like a series of exhortations than a continued journey.",
      "quotes": [
        "What a startling reversal this passage is from what we customarily think.",
        "God never finished that sentence back there in Horeb. This passage in Revelation completes who God is.",
        "All of this knocking is of no purpose... unless you do open the door."

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Taylor achieves a high level of 'reframing' (Cilliers). He takes a well-known, almost 'kitsch' verse (Rev 3:20) and reframes it through the lens of the 'Deus absconditus' and the Burning Bush. He connects the 'knocking' to the specific social context of the Black community (absent fathers, role models) and the liturgical context (summer months, Father's Day). The integration of the 'brick-yard workers' as role models provides a concrete, contextual anchor for the 'holy' happening in the everyday. He respects the 'strangeness' of a God who knocks, refusing to let it remain a mere Sunday School sentiment.",
      "quotes": [
        "They were brick-yard workers and handymen in the week, but I looked at those men... as role models.",
        "The Door is now knocking at the door.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "In terms of Stark's 'Open Work of Art,' the sermon is somewhat 'sealed shut.' While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (loneliness, confusion, absent fathers), the conclusion moves toward a very traditional, almost prescriptive 'happy ending.' The preacher provides the answers ('trust him,' 'try Jesus') in a way that leaves little room for the hearer's own struggle with the 'closed door.' The 'I will give you' sequence at the end is a series of closed exchanges (weakness for strength, etc.) that, while comforting, may feel 'pre-chewed' for a hearer in deep despair. It lacks the 'polyvalence' of an open ending.",
      "quotes": [
        "I will tell you very simply: trust him.",

        "Give me your confusion, and I will give you my peace."

        "The conclusion is overly moralistic/prescriptive ('Open the door').",
        "The sermon resolves the tension of the 'absent God' too quickly with a list of benefits.",
        "Could leave more room for the 'resistance' a hearer might feel toward the Knocker."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily a closed work; it seeks a specific, immediate response (opening the door)."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are characterized by a strong theological 'plot' that links the Old and New Testaments. The sermon effectively 'reframes' the image of the knocking Christ. However, the structural integrity is weakened by a topical digression on Father's Day that, while pastorally important, disrupts the narrative arc. The conclusion leans toward a 'closed' structure, offering immediate resolutions to complex existential problems, which limits the 'space for grace' to a transactional exchange."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon narrowly avoids religious kitsch by grounding the 'knocking Christ' in the profound 'I Am' theology of Exodus. However, the final third of the sermon flirts with kitsch through the use of clichéd Christological titles ('Rose of Sharon') and the promise of immediate 'fun' and 'parties' with Jesus. The 'happy ending'—where Jesus puts food on the table and clothes on the back—risks becoming a 'pre-chewed emotion' that doesn't fully honor the pain of the 'absent father' mentioned earlier. The authentic depth is found in the 'Deus absconditus' section, while the kitsch elements appear in the simplified 'solution' phase.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "You will never know what a party is until you are with the Lord.",

      "The 'Am what?' question at Horeb, acknowledging the mystery of God."

    "recommendation": "Avoid the 'laundry list' of Christological titles and the promise of 'fun'; instead, sustain the tension of the 'Knocker' standing in the dark outside the door."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is opened by the startling realization that God is the seeker. This 'reframing' creates a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) by removing the burden of 'seeking' from the hearer. However, the space is partially closed by the subsequent moralization ('Open the door!') and the transactional language of the conclusion ('Give me X, I give you Y'). The 'mystery' of the knocking God is somewhat explained away by the end, turning an encounter with the Holy into a series of practical benefits.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained in the first half (the elusive God) but resolved too cheaply in the second half.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the 'I Am' is beautifully introduced but then 'filled in' completely, leaving little room for the 'unavailable' God.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the theology of the 'Seeking God,' but moralization prevails in the 'Open the door' exhortation.",
    "recommendation": "End with the image of the Knocker still standing there, inviting the hearer to sit in the silence of the knock rather than rushing to a 'happy' resolution."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the African American 'Grand Style,' characterized by rhythmic excellence and a deep sense of 'reframing' biblical narrative. Taylor masterfully connects the 'Knocker' of Revelation with the 'I Am' of Exodus, creating a theological arc that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant. The micro-aesthetics of rhythm and imagery are particularly strong, creating a 'performance' that mimics the theme of the sermon. However, the macro-aesthetics suffer from a structural digression and a tendency toward a 'closed' conclusion. The sermon moves from a sophisticated aesthetic of 'perception' to a more traditional, almost kitsch-adjacent aesthetic of 'persuasion' toward the end. While it opens significant space for grace by emphasizing God's initiative, it partially closes that space through moralistic imperatives. Overall, it is a 'strong' sermon (7) in its parts, but 'mediocre' (5) in its structural unity, resulting in a solid 6.5.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rhythmic and musical use of language (Anaphora/Cadence).",
      "Theological reframing of Revelation 3:20 through Exodus 3.",

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Dramatic with Rhythmic-Oral emphasis.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Paul Scott Wilson's 'imagery' focus and Johan Cilliers' 'reframing,' though it lacks the 'openness' advocated by Ciska Stark.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who appreciate traditional rhetorical power, rhythmic delivery, and a 'high' Christology grounded in social identity.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the knock echoing in the room.",
      "Use more 'showing' and less 'telling' in the application phase.",
      "Ensure that social/liturgical 'notices' are aesthetically woven into the sermon's imagery."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Taylor's sermon is a testament to the power of the 'aesthetic turn' in its ability to make an old text feel new. Through the lens of homiletic aesthetics, the sermon succeeds in 'painting the picture' of a seeking God. While it falls into some traditional pitfalls of 'closed' structures and religious sentiment, its rhythmic beauty and theological depth ensure that the 'holy happens' in the encounter between the text and the hearer. It is a work of 'sober beauty' that, despite its flaws, creates a genuine space for the encounter with the 'Knocker.'"
