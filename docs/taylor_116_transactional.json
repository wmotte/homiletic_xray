    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of 'Parent-heavy' preaching. While it contains strong Adult elements regarding social justice and history, it ultimately relies on psychological pressure. By defining 'spiritual health' as a state of 'anguish' and 'tension,' the preacher creates a dependency where the listener must constantly look to the 'Parent' (God/Preacher) for relief. The 'Jesus train' finale provides an emotional catharsis that masks the preceding threats of rejection (removal of the candlestick).",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to maintain the Adult-to-Adult transaction throughout. Instead of threatening the removal of power (Parent-to-Child), invite the congregation to evaluate the 'here-and-now' consequences of losing their 'first love' (Adult-to-Adult reflection)."
