    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Rutledge excels in 'showing' rather than 'telling.' She employs two primary image clusters: the mechanical/physical danger (roller coaster, CAT scan) and the political/military (reigning monarch, annihilating army, Empire of Evil). The imagery of the CAT scan is particularly potent because it translates Paul’s abstract 'condemnation' into a modern, visceral experience of 'terminal' diagnosis. She avoids the 'kitsch' of vague religious light by rooting her metaphors in the 'stench' of real-world anxiety—the sound of footsteps, the look on a doctor's face. This aligns with Paul Scott Wilson’s 'Four Pages,' where the 'trouble' is painted with sensory precision. The imagery effectively 'reframes' (Cilliers) the human condition from 'stress' to 'mortal peril.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The whole world is sick, cancerous, tumor-ridden, 'terminal.'",
        "Sin with its favorite and characteristic weapon, Death, forcefully advancing through the world like an annihilating army.",

        "The 'roller coaster' metaphor at the start is slightly disconnected from the deeper 'tumor' imagery.",
        "The transition between the 'airplane magazine' and the 'brain tumor' is somewhat abrupt.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strongly weighted toward 'showing' in the first half; the second half moves more toward 'telling' as it explains Pauline theology, but remains anchored in the previous images."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Rutledge exhibits high 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre). She consciously deconstructs modern euphemisms (stress, pathology, deviance) to reclaim the precision of the word 'Sin.' Her language is economical and avoids 'Canaanite' jargon without explanation; when she uses theological terms like 'original sin' or 'justification,' she has already built a narrative bridge to them. The use of Käsemann’s translation adds a scholarly weight and linguistic sharpness ('Sin won dominion') that avoids the softness of many 1980s sermons. However, the academic aside about 'sophisticated people' slightly breaks the intimate precision of the narrative voice.",
      "quotes": [
        "Sophisticated people in the twentieth century long since gave up talking about sin—we talk about obsessive behavior, or neurotic patterns...",
        "Sin is an objective, demonstrable reality and here’s the evidence for it.",

        "The mention of 'computer printouts' is effective but used multiple times, bordering on a rhetorical crutch.",
        "The critique of 'gurus' is a bit general and lacks the surgical precision of the earlier medical narrative."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Theological jargon is intentionally introduced as a 'cure' for the vagueness of modern psychological language. It is clearly explained through the 'reframing' of the medical crisis."

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a distinct oral quality, moving from the staccato of a crisis ('At 9:00 she came back. Dick and I could tell...') to the liturgical legato of the conclusion. Rutledge uses repetition and parallelism effectively, especially in the final movement ('In him only. In him alone.'). The rhythm mimics the heartbeat of the narrative—fast during the 'four hours of anguish' and slowing down for the 'Space for Grace.' It is clearly 'oral language' rather than 'paper language,' designed to be heard and felt as a 'happening' (Immink).",
      "quotes": [
        "In him alone, in that one man alone, is joy, peace, deliverance, acquittal, and a safe homecoming.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' that avoids religious kitsch. Rutledge uses concrete, visceral imagery (the CAT scan, the doctor's face) to ground abstract Pauline concepts. Her stewardship of language is evident in her refusal to use modern euphemisms for sin, opting instead for a precise, almost clinical theological vocabulary. The rhythm is well-paced, moving from the tension of a medical emergency to the rhythmic, liturgical celebration of Christ’s victory. It is a strong example of 'showing' the gospel through the lens of human vulnerability."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a classic 'Lowry Loop' or 'Homiletical Plot.' It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' (the roller coaster death and the daughter's symptoms). The tension is sustained through the 'longest four hours,' creating a vacuum that only the 'good news' can fill. The turning point is not just the medical clearance, but the theological realization that 'the CAT scan is clear' for the human race in Christ. The movement from 'Adam's world' to 'Christ's world' is not static but a 'dynamic journey' (Van Dusseldorp). The energy remains high because the preacher connects her personal relief to the cosmic relief of the Gospel.",
      "quotes": [
        "It puts a whole new light on roller coasters, doesn’t it?",
        "I did not fall to pieces until I was overwhelmed by the impact of our deliverance.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a textbook example of Cilliers' 'reframing.' Rutledge takes the 'strangeness' of Romans 5 (Adam/Christ typology) and frames it within the modern context of medical anxiety and secular self-reliance. She respects the 'then' of the text (using Käsemann and Augustine) while making the 'now' feel equally urgent. The integration is organic because she uses the medical crisis not just as an 'illustration' but as a phenomenological key to understanding Paul’s 'passion.' She successfully reframes the 'roller coaster' of life from a 'pleasurable high' to a 'mortal peril' that requires a 'Savior.'",
      "quotes": [
        "He is trying to show the church the computer printout with the quantifiable, measurable, objective symptoms.",
        "As children of Adam, we are completely at the mercy of forces that we cannot control.",

      "reframing_present": "The sermon offers a radical new frame: reality is not 'stress' but 'dominion,' and salvation is not 'management' but 'deliverance'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is narratively 'open' (inviting the hearer into the experience of fear and relief), the theological conclusion is quite 'closed' and declarative. Following Ciska Stark, there is room for the 'ambivalence of existence' in the description of the medical crisis, but the ending is a strong, monovalent call to 'yield' to 'that one man.' This is characteristic of Rutledge's 'Sober-Reformed' aesthetics—the 'Space for Grace' is opened by God's act, not by human interpretation. It is less an 'open work of art' and more a 'witness' (Long) that demands a verdict.",
      "quotes": [
        "I can’t prove this to you, any more than Paul could. We know these things only by faith.",
        "Will you grasp the great salvation that comes in Jesus Christ?",
        "In him only. In him alone. That one man."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The final section is very prescriptive and 'sealed shut' with 'In him alone' repetitions.",
        "Could leave more room for the 'not yet'—the fact that Elizabeth still had 'sore eyes' and 'pills' could be used to open up the 'already/not yet' tension further.",
        "The 'fraudulent saviors' section is a bit 'closed' and dismissive of other spiritual paths."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A 'witness' structure that is narratively open but dogmatically closed; it invites participation but forces a choice."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is exceptionally strong, driven by a high-stakes personal narrative that mirrors the theological arc of Romans 5. Rutledge creates a palpable 'upsetting of equilibrium' that makes the proclamation of grace feel like a 'rescue' rather than a 'theory.' The integration of text and context is a masterclass in 'reframing,' turning a CAT scan into a theological lens. While the structure becomes more 'closed' and declarative toward the end, it maintains a 'Space for Grace' by grounding the resolution in an external act of God rather than human effort."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is a powerful antidote to religious kitsch. Rutledge explicitly rejects 'well-meaning suburban friends' who offer 'bright' comfort (kitsch). She sustains the 'pain of suffering' (the four hours of nausea and panic) without resolving it cheaply. The 'happy ending' is tempered by the reality of 'sore eyes' and 'hundreds of pills.' There is no 'sentiment' here, only 'authentic emotion' born of a 'narrow escape.' By using the 'computer printout' and 'quantifiable symptoms,' she avoids the vague, 'pre-chewed' emotions of typical 1980s therapeutic preaching.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'well-meaning suburban friend' saying 'Maybe her symptoms are just from stress' (cited as an example of what to avoid).",

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'waves of fear, nausea, panic, and horror' in the neurologist's office.",
      "The admission of 'collapsing in tears' and needing 'Kleenex' only *after* the danger had passed."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Continue to lean into the 'unresolved' elements of the aftermath (the pills, the sore eyes) to further distance the message from 'easy' evangelical kitsch."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace precisely through the 'narrow escape' motif. Cilliers' 'Space for Grace' requires an acknowledgment of the 'abyss,' which Rutledge does with clinical precision. She sustains the tension between the 'dominion of death' and the 'dominion of the Messiah.' The sermon avoids 'moralization' (we must do X) and instead focuses on 'receiving' (God has done Y). The 'Space' is created by the 'How much more' logic of the text—the overwhelming nature of the gift compared to the peril.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained through the 'longest four hours' and the 'precarious' nature of Adam's life.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of God's intervention is respected; it is presented as a 'miraculous deliverance' that cannot be 'proven' or 'managed.'",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails completely. The only 'task' is the 'yielding' or 'entrusting,' which is presented as a response to a rescue, not a moral requirement.",
    "recommendation": "To create even more space, the preacher could explore the 'silence' of God during those four hours of waiting, allowing the 'mystery' of God's hiddenness to stand alongside His deliverance."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.7,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the 'Sober-Reformed' style, where beauty is found in the precision of truth and the depth of human experience rather than in baroque ornamentation. Rutledge successfully navigates the 'aesthetic turn' by valuing the human factor (the narrative of her daughter) while maintaining the 'vertical dimension' of revelation (the Word coming from outside to rescue). The 'micro-aesthetics' of her language are characterized by a 'stewardship of words' that rejects modern euphemisms for the sharper, more 'living' metaphors of Pauline theology. The 'macro-aesthetics' are driven by a compelling narrative arc that 'reframes' the hearer's reality from one of 'stress management' to one of 'mortal peril and miraculous rescue.' The sermon is a fierce enemy of kitsch, refusing to offer cheap comfort or sentimental solutions. Instead, it opens a 'Space for Grace' by first leading the hearer to the 'brink of the abyss.' While the conclusion is dogmatically 'closed,' it functions as a powerful 'performance' of witness that invites the hearer into a 'happening' of deliverance.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Authentic, non-kitsch narrative that grounds high theology in visceral human experience.",
      "Effective 'reframing' of the human condition using modern medical and political metaphors.",
      "Strong 'Show, Don't Tell' methodology in the first half of the sermon."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The transition between the 'airplane magazine' hook and the core narrative could be more seamless.",
      "The rhythmic 'flatness' of the middle exegetical section compared to the narrative sections.",
      "The slightly dismissive tone toward 'sophisticated people' and other 'saviors' could be softened to increase 'openness'."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Narrative-Dramatic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Preacher as Witness' of Thomas Long.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'sophisticated' but anxious modern hearers who are weary of 'cheap' religious sentiment and seek a 'quantifiable' hope.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more poetic/sensory language for the 'New Life' in Christ to match the power of the 'Death' imagery.",
      "Read the middle theological sections aloud to ensure the 'cadence' matches the narrative sections.",
      "Allow for more 'open endings' that leave the hearer to contemplate the 'already/not yet' tension of their own lives."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Through the lens of homiletic aesthetics, 'That One Man' is a highly effective 'event' (Immink). It avoids the pitfalls of 'Die Aufgabe der Predigt' (ignoring the hearer) by starting deep within the hearer's world of anxiety, yet it fulfills Thurneysen's requirement of a 'vertical' Word by ending with a rescue that comes entirely from outside. It is a 'Space for Grace' that is earned through a courageous look at the 'Empire of Evil.' A score of 7.7 reflects a sermon that is 'excellent' and serves as a strong model for integrating personal narrative with rigorous Pauline theology without falling into the trap of kitsch."
