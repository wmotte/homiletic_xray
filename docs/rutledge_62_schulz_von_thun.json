    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates exceptional exegetical depth, moving beyond a superficial reading of Psalm 118. The 'Sache' (theological core) is the radicality of God's righteousness as an alien righteousness (iustitia aliena). The preacher skillfully navigates the tension between the Psalmist’s cry for victory and the prophetic indictments of Ezekiel. The analysis of the 'performative word' of God is a strong Barthian/Imminkian element, emphasizing God as the Acting Subject. The factual content is not merely informative but serves to deconstruct the listener's self-assured theological categories. It avoids the 'fides quae' trap by constantly linking the doctrine of election and judgment to the immediate political and personal reality of the congregation.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is the theme of the performative word of God.",
        "The word 'righteous' in the Scripture is not exactly as it seems.",
        "God's purpose is something different from the purpose of either party."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong integration of Old Testament prophecy with New Testament theology.",
        "Clear definition of 'prevenient agency' versus human effort."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition between the political critique and the dogmatic explanation of Ezekiel 12 is dense and requires high cognitive load.",
        "The specific reference to Ezekiel 21 in the title is less prominent than Ezekiel 12 in the text."
      ],
      "comprehensibility_check": "High. While the concepts are deep, the language is accessible and the use of Lincoln as a bridge is effective."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a persona that is intellectually rigorous yet pastorally humble. There is a conscious 'Selbstenthüllung' regarding their age ('when you get to be my age') and a vulnerability in the prayer 'May God deliver me from my own righteousness.' The preacher does not hide their political concerns but frames them as a theological struggle rather than mere partisan opinion. The self-revelation is 'diaconal' because it models the very repentance the sermon calls for. There is no 'hysterical' seeking of the stage; the 'I' is used to illustrate the 'rebellious house' that the preacher also inhabits.",
      "quotes": [
        "I am a rebellious house all wrapped up in one person.",
        "I am now going to embarrass my hosts a little bit...",
        "May God deliver me from my own righteousness."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Schizoid blend. The preacher shows a 'Compulsive' need for theological correctness and structural integrity (correcting the program, citing sources), but uses 'Schizoid' distance to objectively analyze the national mood and the text without falling into 'Depressive' harmony-seeking.",
      "diaconal_quality": "High. The preacher’s personality serves as a mirror for the text’s judgment and grace.",
      "strengths": [
        "Authentic admission of being part of the 'rebellious house'.",
        "Avoids the 'moral superiority' trap while delivering a sharp critique."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'embarrassing the hosts' comment, while charming, borders on a minor 'Selbstdarstellung' of the 'uncompromising intellectual'."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'teacher to student' but with a strong sense of 'solidarity in sin.' The preacher speaks 'at eye level' by including themselves in the critique of America and the 'rebellious house.' However, there is a 'Yellow' signal of authority—the preacher is the one who has 'made a study' and knows the 'theological thinkers.' The tone is sobering. There is a risk of 'relationship noise' for listeners who are highly patriotic, as the preacher directly challenges the 'national mood' and the President’s rhetoric. This is a 'healing disruption' intended to break the 'we-they' binary.",
      "quotes": [
        "I’m sure you know the hymn...",
        "We are all equally powerless before God.",
        "Any honest observer of the American scene will admit..."
      ],
      "relationship_noise_check": "The direct critique of the President and national policy may cause 'noise' for listeners who listen with a 'Relationship Ear' that perceives critique of country as a critique of their identity.",
      "attitude_indication": "Solidary-Teaching. The preacher is a fellow traveler who happens to be holding the map.",
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of 'we' to include the preacher in the judgment.",
        "Avoids paternalism by grounding the critique in shared scripture."

        "The critique of video games and movies might feel like 'generational noise' to a younger college audience."

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is a masterclass in the 'Zuspruch vs. Anspruch' balance. The 'Appeal' is not a call to 'do better' (Law), but a call to 'trust God's doing' (Gospel). The preacher explicitly rejects the psychological appeal of 'self-help' and 'potential.' The 'Red' side is directed toward a 're-orientation of the heart' which is itself described as a work of God. The demand is to 'be still' and let God be the actor. This is theologically profound: the appeal is to cease the human appeal and rest in the divine promise. The risk of moralism is extremely low.",
      "quotes": [
        "I don’t want my righteousness—I want his righteousness.",
        "The Commandments will cease to be tablets of stone that judge us, and they will be written in our hearts.",
        "He will win this struggle... because he is God and we aren’t."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The promise (Zuspruch) is the absolute foundation. The demand (Anspruch) is merely the invitation to accept the gift.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Very low. The preacher explicitly deconstructs moralism as 'filthy rags'.",
      "strengths": [
        "Clear distinction between human righteousness and Christ's righteousness.",
        "The appeal is grounded in the 'performative word' of God."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'appeal' to understand the political situation could be more clearly linked to the final 'appeal' to trust in Christ's righteousness to avoid a dualistic feel."

  "congruence_and_disruptions": {
    "congruence_judgment": "Highly congruent. The preacher’s sober tone, the rigorous exegetical content, and the humble self-revelation all align to point toward the 'Sache' of God's sovereignty.",

    "disruptions": "Minor incongruence between the 'academic' setting/tone and the 'lurid' imagery of Ezekiel, which the preacher acknowledges.",
    "healing_disruption": "Yes. The preacher disrupts the 'nationalist-religious' relationship by using the 'Blue' side (Ezekiel's text) to challenge the 'Yellow' side (the congregation's self-image as the 'elect' nation)."

  "reception_simulation": {
    "the_factual_ear_hears": "A rigorous argument that 'righteousness' in the Bible is a gift from God, not a national or personal achievement, supported by Ezekiel and Paul.",
    "the_relational_ear_hears": "A challenge to my identity as an American and a 'good person,' but also an invitation into a community of 'powerless' people loved by God.",
    "the_appeal_ear_hears": "Stop trying to be righteous on your own; look to Christ's righteousness and trust His performative word.",
    "the_self_revelation_ear_hears": "This preacher is a seasoned, slightly weary, but deeply faithful theologian who struggles with the same pride I do."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 8.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exceptional example of homiletical integrity. It successfully integrates the psychological insights of the Four-Sides-Model by ensuring all 'sides' serve the theological 'Sache'. The preacher avoids the common pitfall of 'psychologization'—where God becomes a means to human self-actualization—by insisting on God as the Acting Subject (Immink/Barth). The critique of the 'national mood' is not merely political but is used as a 'healing disruption' to expose the theological error of self-righteousness. The transition from the 'Law' of human violence and national pride to the 'Gospel' of Christ’s imputed righteousness is handled with surgical precision. The preacher’s Riemann-type (Compulsive/Schizoid) serves the text well, providing a stable, objective platform for a message that is existentially unsettling. The sermon ends not with a 'to-do list' but with the 'marvelous' doing of God.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon avoids unhealthy psychologization. It treats the human condition not as a problem to be solved by the self, but as a 'rebellious house' that can only be addressed by the 'Extra Nos' of God's grace.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological depth and consistency (Barthian/Calvinist rigor).",
      "Courageous 'healing disruption' of nationalistic idols.",
      "Clear distinction between Law (human effort) and Gospel (God's performative word)."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Could bridge the 'political' opening and the 'dogmatic' middle more fluidly.",
      "The 'video game' illustration feels slightly dated/external to the core argument.",
      "The 'embarrassment of the hosts' could be perceived as a subtle power-play."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, communicatively congruent sermon that subordinates psychological technique to the sovereignty of the Word."
