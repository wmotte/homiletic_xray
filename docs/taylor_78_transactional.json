    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It avoids the common 'Critical Parent' trap of religious discourse. Instead of using guilt to drive prayer, it uses 'Nurturing Parent' empathy to validate the listener's exhaustion. By grounding the discourse in the 'Adult' reality of history and social struggle, the preacher builds a foundation of dignity. The 'Free Child' is engaged through poetic beauty, making the call to prayer feel like an invitation to vitality rather than a burdensome duty.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' instead of 'you' when discussing failure. Maintain the transparency regarding the difficulty of the spiritual life to prevent the 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' game."
