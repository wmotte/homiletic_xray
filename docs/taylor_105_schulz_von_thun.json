    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The factual content centers on the intersection of national crisis and the Passion narrative. The preacher establishes a dogmatic framework where God's sovereignty ('axles of justice') remains constant even in perceived absence. The exegetical move connects the 'dark night' of the contemporary audience to the 'veil over Calvary.' While the theological 'Sache'—the hidden work of God—is clear, the blue side suffers from a lack of specific biblical exposition, relying instead on broad strokes of the Passion story (Judas, Peter, the Centurion) to validate a general providence. The 'fides quae' is presented as a cosmic certainty rather than a detailed scriptural argument, which may leave the intellectually rigorous listener wanting more exegetical depth.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a persona of stoic confidence and deep empathy. There is a palpable sense of shared burden ('we are confident'), suggesting the preacher is not an observer but a participant in the 'dark and fearful night.' The language is heavy, laden with words like 'tortured,' 'insuperable,' and 'horror,' which reveals a preacher who does not shy away from the gravity of human suffering. However, there is a controlled quality to this revelation; it is a 'diaconal' I that serves to bolster the congregation's morale rather than indulge in personal catharsis.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are confident that God makes his universe to turn on axles of justice.",
        "To some it must appear unbearable, the burden insuperable."

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Depressive mix. The 'Compulsive' element shows in the need for structural order (axles of justice, tides of the universe), while the 'Depressive' element manifests in the deep, harmonious solidarity with those suffering.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined by a shared national and spiritual identity. The preacher speaks 'with' the congregation, yet from a position of prophetic oversight. There is a 'teaching' attitude that borders on the paternalistic—instructing the hearer that it would be 'vain to imagine' God's absence. This creates a slight relationship noise: the preacher corrects the hearer's potential despair before fully validating it. The 'we-definition' is strong, but the authority is exercised 'from above' by interpreting the hearer's experience for them.",

        "But it would be vain to imagine...",
        "Those across this land who have made their commitment..."

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily internal: 'Do not lose heart' and 'See God's hand in the dark.' It is an appeal to faith (Zuspruch) rather than a moralistic demand (Anspruch). However, there is a subtle 'Law' present in the 'commitment to the Christian way of sacrifice.' The preacher implies that the hearer must remain 'plastic to the workings of God's grace' like Peter. The directional force is toward endurance. The theological promise (God is at work) is the basis, but the appeal for the hearer to 'peer through the night' places a significant psychological weight on the believer's persistence.",
      "quotes": [
        "Peering through the tortured night waiting for the morning to come...",
        "Searching the skies for some sign of approaching dawn..."

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The promise of God's activity (Zuspruch) outweighs the demand, but the demand for 'sacrifice' is the entry point.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Low, as the focus is on God's 'axles of justice' rather than human effort alone.",
      "strengths": [
        "The appeal is grounded in the character of God, not just human will.",
        "Provides a clear direction for the hearer's internal state."

        "Make the 'Gift' of grace more explicit to relieve the pressure of 'sacrifice'.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon fragment demonstrates a robust homiletical structure that seeks to anchor a national crisis in the meta-narrative of the Passion. Theologically, it aligns with a Barthian emphasis on God as the Acting Subject ('the Father who worked hitherto works still'), resisting the urge to turn the sermon into a mere psychological pep talk. However, from a Schulz von Thun perspective, the 'Yellow' side (Relationship) carries a paternalistic weight that may alienate a listener who feels genuinely abandoned by God. The preacher's 'Green' side (Self-revelation) is disciplined and diaconal, effectively using the persona of a steadfast leader. The 'Red' side (Appeal) is well-integrated, though it flirts with a 'Law of Persistence' that could overwhelm the 'Depressive' listener. The 'Blue' side (Factual) provides a necessary cosmic anchor, though it relies on high-level abstractions like 'axles of justice' which, while poetic, require more grounding in the specific 'Sache' of the text to reach a score of 8 or higher.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a slight risk of 'nationalizing' the Gospel ('saving of the nation'), which Barth would warn against as a form of natural theology.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological gravity and lack of superficiality.",
      "Strong use of biblical archetypes (Judas, Peter, Centurion).",
      "Congruence between tone and content."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce paternalistic language ('it would be vain').",
      "Deepen the exegetical link between the Matthew text and the contemporary 'night'.",
      "Distinguish more clearly between national duty and the Gospel promise."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A solid, serious piece of homiletic work that successfully communicates God's sovereignty, though it risks over-burdening the hearer's 'Appeal Ear' through its high-register rhetoric."
