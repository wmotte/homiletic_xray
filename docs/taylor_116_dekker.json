    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon stays close to the narrative of the Ephesian church in Revelation 2. However, it fails Dekker's test of finding what is unique to THIS text. The preacher treats the 'first love' as a general synonym for 'Jesus' rather than the specific historical-theological crisis of the Ephesian congregation.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Lord says to the church at Ephesus, 'I know thy works.'",
        "We come to that fourth verse. I wish we didn't have that fourth verse there."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify what 'first love' means specifically in the context of Ephesus that distinguishes it from other churches like Smyrna or Laodicea, rather than merging it into a general call to 'hitch to Jesus'."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "There is a clear attempt at exposition. The preacher references the Greek 'angelos', the historical city of Ephesus (Temple of Diana), and the Nicolaitans. However, it remains somewhat at the level of a travelogue or encyclopedia entry rather than deep theological exegesis.",
      "quotes": [
        "originally the word angel (angélos) meant only 'messenger.'",
        "Its centerpiece was the temple of Diana, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the historical data (the Temple of Diana, the Nicolaitans) more directly to the theological tension of the text instead of providing it as mere background information."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application starts strong with a specific mention of racial tensions in the city, but then devolves into generalities about 'hitching your car to the Jesus train.' Dekker forbids general truths; the sermon ends in a vague metaphor of success.",
      "quotes": [
        "I said this week to one of our city officials that our city is in great need of healing. This is a bruised city.",
        "If you want a formula for success, I'm going to give it to you this morning... hitch yourself to Jesus."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the 'formula for success' rhetoric. Apply the specific warning of the 'removed candlestick' to the concrete institutional and spiritual life of the Brooklyn congregation."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a traditional 'block' structure: first the history of Ephesus, then the text, then the application. While there are flashes of interwoveness when discussing the city's 'bruised' state, the two movements remain largely separate.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ephesus, what a city! ... You read chapters 18 and 19 of Acts when you are home...",
        "Well, I guess that's about what I've got to tell you today, except for one thing..."

      "improvement_point": "Draw the hearer into the text of Revelation from the beginning so that the 'exposition' of Ephesus is simultaneously an 'exposition' of the current congregation's heart."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'misery' (the loss of power/candlestick) is present, and 'redemption' is centered in Christ. However, the 'gratitude' part is replaced by a 'success' motif, which shifts the subject from a grateful man to a successful man.",
      "quotes": [
        "there's nothing so sad as a church which has lost its spiritual power.",
        "If you want a formula for success... You hitch yourself to Jesus."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Reframe the ending not as 'getting to the place your heart sighs' (success), but as the 'gratitude' of a church restored to its first love."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is a stronger point. The preacher takes the threat of the removed candlestick seriously, rejecting the 'somewhat' translation to emphasize the gravity of God's judgment. There is a sense of 'temporal loss' for the church.",
      "quotes": [
        "Repent or I will come quickly. I'll take the candlestick away from you.",
        "A church which has lost its power, the world can do anything to it."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "While Christ is mentioned frequently and passionately, He is presented as a 'train' to hitch one's dreams to. This risks making Christ a means to an end (man's dreams) rather than the telos (God's glory).",
      "quotes": [
        "Christ is the power of this church!",
        "The car of your dreams may not be able to move... but you hitch it to the Jesus train."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure Christ is the 'telos' (the goal) rather than the 'generator' for human success. The sermon should point to salvation outside self, not dreams within self."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At roughly 18.5 minutes, the sermon falls just short of Dekker’s 20-minute minimum. The final third of the sermon is repetitive 'altar call' rhetoric rather than substantive 'breadth' that leads to 'depth'.",
      "improvement_point": "Use the final minutes for deeper dogmatic or ethical reflection on the nature of 'first love' rather than repeating the 'Jesus train' metaphor."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon fails to meet Dekker's standard for duration and substantive depth, particularly in its concluding move toward a 'success formula.' While it correctly identifies the gravity of the biblical warning (Thesis 6) and attempts historical exposition (Thesis 2), it ultimately treats the specific text as a springboard for general Christocentric enthusiasm rather than a unique word that can be found 'nowhere else.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong rejection of 'soft' translations, maintaining the biblical tension of judgment (Thesis 6).",
      "Clear attempt to ground the sermon in the original historical context of Ephesus (Thesis 2).",
      "Direct engagement with the contemporary 'zeitgeist' regarding urban racial tension (Thesis 3)."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 'Jesus train' metaphor borders on 'theological nonsense' by making Christ a vehicle for human dreams (Thesis 7).",
      "Insufficient length to achieve the 'breadth' required for true homiletic depth (Thesis 8).",
      "The application becomes general and individualistic toward the end, losing the specificity of the Ephesian context (Thesis 3)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a partial sermon. It begins with the necessary tools of a minister (exposition and seriousness), but it fails to mount the wheel properly by substituting a 'formula for success' for the 'application of a specific Bible passage.' It lacks the required 20-minute depth and the strict Christ-as-telos focus Dekker demands."
