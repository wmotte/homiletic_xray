    "sermon_start_end": "Jesus was massively alert to and concerned for the terrible, cynical inequities that beset the human community. He told a story about those inequities to help his hearers think again [...] While you are haunted, consider this very odd fact. The poor man is remembered. We know his name, Lazarus, as does even father Abraham. The rich man never had a name or an identity. He had only a social role which was temporary and did not last. He is forgotten, unnamed, and abandoned. No name, and no comfort, no future, no water. His future haunts our present."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon stays closely tied to the pericope of the Rich Man and Lazarus. It identifies a specific theological tension (Abraham vs. Moses) within the text. However, it leans toward a general theme of 'inequity' rather than uncovering what can be found *nowhere else* in the Bible.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is the story appointed for this Sunday in our lectionary.",
        "The story is such an odd proposal... to suggest that the real stuff of our life happens after death."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Sharpen the focus on the unique linguistic or structural features of this specific parable that distinguish it from other 'reversal' parables in Luke."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates awareness of the Old Testament background (Genesis/Exodus) but lacks explicit engagement with the original Greek or the specific historical-religious context of Second Temple Judaism regarding Hades and Abraham's Bosom.",
      "quotes": [
        "He has read the Old Testament, and he knows the theological options that are available for a storyteller.",
        "He knows about father Abraham, because he has read the book of Genesis."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate more rigorous historical-critical exegesis of the 'great chasm' and the significance of the name 'Lazarus' in its original context."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is surprisingly vague for a sermon on such a concrete text. The preacher explicitly denies giving advice or a 'blueprint,' which contradicts Dekker's demand for concrete application to politics, society, or the church.",
      "quotes": [
        "The story does not ask anyone to do anything.",
        "nothing here about 'welfare' or 'the private sector', nothing here about how to vote or spend or share or save."

      "improvement_point": "Reject the 'haunting' as a final goal; instead, provide the concrete application to the 'zeitgeist' that Dekker requires."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Exposition and application are somewhat mixed through the 'haunting' motif, but the sermon follows a largely narrative-descriptive structure that keeps the application at a distance.",
      "quotes": [
        "In our hearing of the story, we are closest to the role of the brothers.",
        "Our common talk of religion and politics and economics is mostly about safe things."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Draw the hearer more directly into the 'exposition' so they are 'expounded' alongside the text, rather than observing the story from the outside."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The 'misery' of the rich man is well-articulated as a lack of identity. However, 'redemption' and 'gratitude' are almost entirely absent, leaving the hearer in a state of 'haunting' rather than grace.",
      "quotes": [
        "He is forgotten, unnamed, and abandoned. No name, and no comfort, no future, no water.",
        "The story does not ask anyone to do anything."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "This is the sermon's strongest point. It takes the reality of being 'lost' (both temporally and eternally) with extreme seriousness, aligning well with Dekker's Thesis 6.",
      "quotes": [
        "He knows he is destined to be on the wrong side of the ditch... cut off from all forms of life and hope.",
        "decisions about our wealth and poverty were of eternal significance."

      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as a 'storyteller' but is not the telos (goal) of the sermon. The sermon ends with the rich man's misery rather than the salvation found in Christ. Grace is mentioned as a concept but not applied as the 'deepest of our life.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus, this terrible storyteller, gives us a zinger.",
        "His future haunts our present."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make Christ the telos. Show how Christ, as the one who truly rose from the dead (unlike the request in the parable), fulfills the warning of Moses and the promise of Abraham."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "At approximately 18 minutes, the sermon falls slightly short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. While it has some 'breadth,' it lacks the dogmatic depth Dekker expects.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the theological reflection on the 'two natures' of Christ or the dogmatic implications of the 'two ways' to reach the required depth and length."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon succeeds in maintaining the tension of the 'two ways' and the seriousness of eternal loss, but it fails significantly in providing concrete application and a Christocentric telos. It remains stuck in a 'haunting' of the Law (Moses) without moving toward the Gospel (Christ).",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong emphasis on the 'two ways' and the reality of being lost.",
      "Effective use of the biblical narrative to challenge the hearer's comfort.",
      "Traceable connection to the specific pericope."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of concrete, contemporary application (Thesis 3).",
      "Absence of Christ as the theological telos (Thesis 7).",
      "Insufficient length and dogmatic depth (Thesis 8)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This text is an effective rhetorical speech, but according to Dekker's criteria, it is an incomplete sermon. It fails to recreate the Bible into a 'new, current, proclamatory word' because it refuses to apply the text concretely and fails to point to Christ as the only salvation from the 'misery' it so clearly describes."
