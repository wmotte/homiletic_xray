    "sermon_start_end": "In the book of Acts, the apostles and witnesses and preachers and church folk were running loose in the Roman Empire. They were talking gospel talk and they were walking the walk of empowered obedience to the gospel. As a result they were drawing big crowds of people [...] This is an ancient story; it is at the same time a contemporary story. It turns out to be our story of the big resurrection and the many mini-resurrections that are enacted in its wake. It is no wonder that the authorities had their breath taken away.",
    "notes": "The sermon focuses on the tension between imperial power and the 'counter-authority' of the Gospel. It uses a socio-political lens characteristic of Walter Brueggemann's style."

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon lacks a contemporary 'hook' or a specific, recognizable situation from the modern hearer's life world. It begins immediately within the biblical world of the Roman Empire. While it uses vivid language ('running loose', 'talking gospel talk'), it remains at a historical distance. The emotional connection is sought through the 'lame beggar' narrative, but this is treated more as a plot point than a visceral experience for the listener. The 'feeling' level is addressed primarily through the lens of 'nervousness' and 'intimidation' regarding power structures, which may feel abstract to those not currently engaged in political dissent.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher pauses to analyze the human condition through the lens of power and control. He explores the 'why' behind the authorities' actions, providing a cultural and social contextualization of the conflict. The 'problem'—the clash between life-giving power and status-quo maintenance—is explored from the perspective of the 'nervous authorities.' It effectively identifies the underlying patterns of intimidation and the desire for monopoly over resources.",

The theological framework is logical and clear. The exegesis of Peter’s speech is solid, connecting the healing of the beggar directly to the resurrection of Jesus. The preacher moves from the specific event to a universal theological truth about the 'juices of life' unleashed by God, which defy imperial control.",

      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the sermon ends with an invitation to 'perform mini-resurrections,' it remains largely metaphorical and general. There are no concrete action steps or specific ethical calls. The hearer is told they are 'authorized,' but not *how* to implement this in their specific context. The application is more of an 'invitation to imagine' than a 'call to do.' It lacks the pragmatic 'how-to' that completes the learning cycle for many adults.",

It begins within the biblical world, missing an opportunity to ground the message in the hearer's immediate concrete experience. However, it excels in reflective observation, offering a sharp critique of power structures and institutional control. The abstract conceptualization is the sermon's greatest strength, particularly the memorable distinction between the 'Big Resurrection' of Christ and the 'mini-resurrections' expected of the church. This provides a clear intellectual framework for the hearer. Unfortunately, the sermon remains largely in the realm of ideas and metaphors. The final section, intended for active experimentation, is too general and liturgical to offer concrete guidance for daily life. Consequently, the sermon serves the 'Assimilating' and 'Diverging' learners well but leaves the 'Converging' and 'Accommodating' learners without a clear path forward.",

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a intellectually stimulating and prophetically charged piece of homiletic work that successfully re-frames a familiar text. It scores high on theological depth and reflective analysis. However, from a Kolb perspective, it is an incomplete learning cycle. It prioritizes the 'what' and the 'why' over the 'who' (identification) and the 'how' (application). For a congregation to truly 'learn' the resurrection life, they need more than a new conceptual framework; they need to be shown how to embody it in the specific, messy details of their own lives. The priority for improvement is to move from the 'Visionary' height of the 'Big Resurrection' to the 'Pragmatic' ground of daily obedience."
