    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively connects the biblical 'storm' to contemporary anxieties. It moves beyond abstract 'fear' by naming specific economic and social stressors. The identification is not with the disciples as historical figures, but with the hearer as a passenger on the 'sinking ship' of industrial society. It touches the emotional level by referencing the loss of sleep and the physical 'tick' of a worker.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the strongest phase of the sermon. The preacher pauses extensively to analyze the 'why' of human condition. He uses psychoanalytic theory (separation anxiety) and sociological critique (capitalism as a factory/supermarket) to explore the roots of fear. It avoids premature 'Jesus-answers' by first honoring the complexity of the human psyche.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Theological concepts are present but often subordinated to psychological categories. The 'Big Idea' is that faith is the 'processing' (bearbeiten) of fear rather than its removal. The exegesis is minimal; the preacher treats the miracle as a 'nature wonder' trope to be bypassed in favor of 'psychological laws'.",

The transition from 'swords to plowshares' is a powerful image but remains a metaphorical call for transformation rather than a concrete step.",

It excels at taking a common human experience (fear) and subjecting it to a deep, multi-layered analysis using psychological and sociological tools. It successfully moves the hearer from a 'symptom' (anxiety) to a 'root cause' (separation). However, it falls short of providing a truly 'Active' conclusion. The theological work is largely a re-interpretation of psychological categories, which provides intellectual clarity but may lack the 'otherness' of the biblical text. It is a sermon for the 'Assimilating' learner—someone who finds peace through understanding and logical frameworks.",

    "conclusion": "This is a high-quality, intellectually stimulating sermon that successfully completes the first three phases of Kolb's cycle with sophistication. It is particularly strong in 'Reflective Observation', offering a 'Sage-like' wisdom that helps the hearer diagnose their own existential condition. However, it remains somewhat 'top-heavy', favoring the head and the eyes over the hands. For a complete 'Homiletic Window', the preacher should strive to ground the lofty visions of 'currents of love' and 'global solidarity' in the grit of specific, local, and individual action. It is a diagnostic success but a pragmatic 'work in progress'."
