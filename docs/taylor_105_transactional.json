It avoids the common trap of using guilt (Critical Parent) to motivate, instead using historical/biblical examples to provide an Adult framework for understanding current suffering. However, it risks keeping the congregation in a passive 'waiting' (Child) mode by over-emphasizing the 'veil' over God's activity.",
