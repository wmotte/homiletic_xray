    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a strong 'hook' by referencing 1970s seminary culture and pop culture (The Lion King, Lord of the Rings). It effectively connects the abstract concept of 'kingship' to the hearer's cultural memory. However, the experience remains somewhat intellectualized until the later narrative about the son's overdose, which provides a visceral, emotional anchor for the theological claims.",

        "The initial 'experience' is more of a cultural observation than a personal identification; more 'slices of life' regarding the struggle with authority could deepen this.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher spends significant time observing the 'problem'—specifically the modern resistance to hierarchy and the 'mainline' tendency to domesticate Jesus. He asks 'why' we struggle with these terms. However, the reflection is heavily weighted toward a critique of others (the academy, 'mainline churches') rather than inviting the hearer into a deep, objective analysis of their own internal resistance to God's rule until the very end.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a robust, intellectually rigorous defense of the sovereignty of Christ, leaning heavily into Kolb's Abstract Conceptualization phase. It effectively identifies a cultural 'problem' (the rejection of kingship) and provides a deep theological solution rooted in the Davidic covenant and the Incarnation. However, it falls short in the Active Experimentation phase, offering few concrete handles for the congregation beyond the internal disposition of 'trust.' The narrative of the grieving father provides a necessary emotional anchor that prevents the sermon from becoming a purely academic lecture. While it addresses the 'Assimilating' learner with high precision, it leaves the 'Converging' learner with little practical direction. The tone is authoritative and occasionally polemical, which serves the 'Declarative' structure well but may limit the 'Visionary' appeal for some.",

      "Bridge the gap between 'cosmic kingship' and 'daily obedience' with specific ethical examples."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong example of the 'Declarative' style, excelling in theological conceptualization and biblical exposition. From a Kolb perspective, it successfully moves the hearer from a cultural experience into a deep theological reflection. However, the cycle remains incomplete due to a lack of robust 'Active Experimentation.' The priority for improvement is to translate the high-level Christology into concrete, lived discipleship. The sermon effectively addresses the 'Head' and 'Heart,' but leaves the 'Hands' largely idle. It is a sober, traditionalist diagnosis of the modern condition that provides a clear theological cure, but lacks the practical prescription for the patient's daily walk."
