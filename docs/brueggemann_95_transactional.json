        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "Coercion is the subject of the sermon's critique. The preacher exposes the 'Critical Parent' within the listener's tradition and invites them to move past it.",

      "presence": "High",
      "analysis": "The preacher addresses the listener as a thinking subject capable of 'revising' and 'abandoning' old scripts. He uses the 'Here-and-Now' of social issues (race, gender, immigration) to test reality.",

    "communicative_purity_score": 9,
    "purity_explanation": "The sermon is highly transparent. It names the discomfort of the transition and doesn't use 'bait' to lure the listener into a trap.",
    "risk_explanation": "There is a slight risk of a 'Nurturing Parent -> Adapted Child' transaction if the listener feels forced to adopt the preacher's progressive views as a new 'must'."

    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust. It utilizes a strong Adult ego state to deconstruct the Critical Parent (the 'codes' of exclusion). By admitting his own anxiety, the preacher avoids the 'Rescuer' trap and invites the congregation into an authentic, shared human experience. It promotes autonomy and reality-testing over blind compliance.",
