    "logos": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The Logos of this service is exceptionally high due to its rigorous, symmetrical architecture. It follows the historical 'O Antiphons' sequence, providing a chronological and theological progression from creation (Wisdom) through the Law (Adonai) to the Messianic fulfillment (Emmanuel). The internal consistency is maintained by the repetitive structure: Antiphon -> Scripture Reading -> Hymn. This creates a logical 'thread' that is impossible to lose. The movement from the 'Old' (prophecy/type) to the 'New' (implied fulfillment in Christ) provides a rational framework for the doctrine of the Incarnation.",
      "quotes": [
        "O Wisdom, coming forth from the mouth of the Most High... Come and teach us the way of prudence.",
        "May we now therefore mark in Holy Scripture the tale of the loving purposes of God from the first days of our disobedience unto the glorious redemption.",
        "O Key of David... you open and no one can shut; you shut and no one can open."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Rigidly consistent structural framework based on historical liturgy.",
        "Clear thematic progression from Wisdom to Emmanuel.",
        "Strong causal links between the prophetic texts and the liturgical responses."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The lack of a contemporary 'bridge' or explanatory homily may leave the logical application to modern life unstated.",
        "The transition between the Law (Adonai) and the Root of Jesse could benefit from a brief connective sentence.",
        "The complexity of the medieval imagery requires high cognitive effort from the listener."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The Logos is found in the architecture of the liturgy rather than the argumentation of a speaker."
    },
    "pathos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Pathos is generated through atmosphere and sensory language rather than direct emotional appeal. The use of 'O'—the vocative of longing—creates a sense of yearning and desire. The imagery is rich (burning bush, shadow of death, clay, morning star), which appeals to the imagination. However, because the text is strictly liturgical and formal, it lacks the 'heart-pathos' of personal identification. It evokes a 'numinous' awe rather than a personal emotional response. The emotional tone is one of solemn expectation and 'holy longing'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Come and lead the prisoners from the prison house, those who dwell in darkness.",
        "Come and save the human race whom you fashioned from clay.",
        "Stir up thy strength, O Lord, and come to reign over thy people Israel!"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of the 'longing' tone inherent in the Advent season.",
        "Rich, evocative sensory imagery (light, darkness, fire, clay).",
        "Musical integration reinforces the affective charge of the words."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The language is highly formal and distant, which may prevent immediate emotional resonance for some.",
        "Lack of 'slices of life' or modern recognizable human struggle.",
        "The repetitive structure, while logically strong, can become emotionally monotonous."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Pathos is 'high' and liturgical (awe/longing) rather than 'low' and personal (empathy/vulnerability).",
      "emotional_tone": "Solemn longing and expectant hope."
    },
    "ethos": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Ethos in this context is 'institutional' rather than 'personal'. The speaker (the leader of the Bidding Prayer) hides entirely behind the tradition and the 'we' of the congregation. There is no personal testimony or vulnerability. The credibility comes from the weight of the tradition (the 'early medieval Roman rite') and the authority of Scripture. While this creates a sense of stability, it lacks the 'witness' quality of a preacher who is personally subject to the message. The preacher is a 'master of ceremonies' rather than a 'witness'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Beloved in Christ, we are met together in this season of Advent to prepare ourselves.",
        "Let us therefore beseech our Heavenly Father that of his mercy he will forgive our past deeds.",
        "I look from afar: and lo, I see the power of God coming."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "High authority derived from historical and scriptural fidelity.",
        "Collective humility ('we are sorely hindered by our sins').",
        "Clarity of purpose in the Bidding Prayer."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Complete absence of personal vulnerability or individual voice.",
        "The distance between the speaker and the message is maximal.",
        "The authority feels more like 'status' (clerical) than 'witness' (experiential)."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Ethos is borrowed from the tradition rather than generated by the speaker's character.",
      "authenticity": "Low personal vulnerability; high institutional integrity."

  "rhetorical_balance_analysis": {
    "dominant_mode": "Logos",
    "suppressed_mode": "Ethos",
    "balance_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The service is heavily weighted toward Logos (structure and doctrine) and Pathos (liturgical atmosphere). The Ethos is the weakest link because the structure is designed to be 'priest-proof'—the person of the speaker is irrelevant to the efficacy of the rite. The balance is typical for high-church liturgy where the 'objective' beauty of the Word and Music takes precedence over the 'subjective' personality of the preacher.",
    "consequences_of_imbalance": [
      "Hearers seeking intellectual clarity and aesthetic beauty will be highly satisfied.",
      "Hearers seeking personal connection or 'authentic' human sharing may feel the service is cold or distant.",
      "The risk is that the message remains 'up there' in the realm of ideas and art, without landing in the 'here' of daily life."
    ],
    "recommendation_for_balance": "Introduce a brief (3-5 minute) homily after the Fourth 'O' to ground the celestial imagery in a concrete, personal example of 'opening' or 'imprisonment'."

    "orthopraxy_ethos": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "While the text calls for 'amending our lives,' the lack of concrete examples makes the call to action abstract."
    }
  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_rhetorical_score": 6.3,
    "summary": "This liturgical service is a masterclass in structural Logos. It uses a centuries-old framework to present a coherent theological narrative of redemption. The rhetorical power lies not in persuasion through argument, but in immersion through repetition and beauty. However, from a modern homiletical perspective, it lacks the personal Ethos and concrete application required to move a contemporary audience toward specific change. It is 'beautiful' and 'true,' but perhaps too 'distant.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional structural coherence and thematic unity.",
      "Rich, evocative biblical and liturgical imagery.",
      "Integration of music and text to create a unified atmosphere."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Lack of personal witness or speaker vulnerability.",
      "Absence of concrete application to modern ethical life.",
      "High barrier to entry for those unfamiliar with medieval liturgical language."
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Liturgical-Narrative",
    "audience_analysis": "Most appealing to those who value tradition, aesthetic beauty, and intellectual order (the 'head' and 'imagination').",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Incorporate a personal story of 'waiting' to strengthen Ethos.",
      "Use more 'low' metaphors alongside the 'high' biblical ones.",
      "Explicitly link one of the 'O' titles to a contemporary social or personal struggle."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The service is rhetorically effective as a 'rite' but limited as a 'proclamation.' It excels in Logos through its architecture and in Pathos through its aesthetic, but it fails to utilize the power of Ethos. It is a 7 for a cathedral setting, but would be a 4 in a context requiring direct personal engagement."
