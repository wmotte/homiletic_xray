For we ask it in his name and for his sake. Amen."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon begins with a specific verse (Matt 26:30), but quickly drifts into a thematic discourse on civil rights and social justice. The 'specific' element—the singing of the hymn before the passion—is used as a springboard for a general contrast between 'piety' and 'violence', rather than unearthing what this text says that can be found nowhere else.",
      "quotes": [
        "The passage clearly states that they sang a hymn... But the Gospel goes on to say that when they had sung a hymn they went out into the mount of Olives."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the unique theological weight of Christ singing in the face of death. What is the specific 'new, current, proclamatory word' of this exact moment in the passion narrative?"
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is almost no formal exegesis. The preacher describes the 'atmosphere' and 'soft lights' (eisegetical imagination) rather than the historical-theological context of the Hallel psalms usually sung at Passover. The requirement for Hebrew/Greek knowledge or historical context of Israel is absent.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is somebody's garret room, doubtless in a humble home, on some undistinguished back street..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the meaning of the Passover liturgy and the specific significance of the Mount of Olives in Jewish messianic expectation to ground the 'exposition'."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is very concrete, particularly regarding the American civil rights struggle, the building industry in New York, and political power. It avoids 'general truths' by naming specific social sins. However, it risks becoming a political speech rather than a scriptural application.",
      "quotes": [
        "They were protesting the systematic exclusion of a whole section of the population from the total building industry.",
        "The Hayes-Tilden decision of the 1870s."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application flows from the text's specific logic rather than using the text as a metaphor for modern political movements."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon moves from the 'scene' to the 'principle' to the 'contemporary struggle'. While not a strict 15/5 split, the text is quickly left behind to serve the application. The hearer is drawn into the 'movement' of the civil rights struggle more than the 'movement' of the biblical text.",
      "quotes": [
        "The deed at Calvary... has established that principle in the earth forever."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Return to the specific words of Matthew 26:30 throughout the sermon to show how the text itself 'expounds' the hearer."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Misery is present (social oppression, 'sweat and screams'), and redemption is linked to Calvary. However, the 'gratitude' (sanctification) is framed largely as political activism. The 'misery' is more sociological than 'misery before God'.",
      "quotes": [
        "These were individuals who broke the laws as they knew them in the interest of a higher law.",
        "Equal in guilt, equal in the sufficiency of the transactions there for their redemption."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' to include the spiritual lostness of the human heart before God, not just the 'systemic bigotry' of the state."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are present in a collective/temporal sense (the nation failing its soul), but the eternal dimension is absent. The sermon leans heavily on the 'liberal tradition' of collective loss mentioned by Dekker.",
      "quotes": [
        "what profit it a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? We had better learn that lesson, and quickly!"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the individual responsibility and the possibility of being 'lost' in the sense of Luther’s 'dying alone', to balance the collective focus."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is called the 'telos', but he often functions as an 'influence' or a 'standard of judgment' rather than the living Lord. The inclusion of 'other sheep' outside the church through 'the power of the new being' risks making Christ a symbol for human progress.",
      "quotes": [
        "Some of them are not a part of any church... But they are under the influence of Calvary."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Clarify that Christ is God (the two natures) and that salvation is 'outside himself' (extra nos), rather than an internal 'power of the new being' found in secular movements."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 17.5 minutes (1750 words), the sermon falls short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' of systematic theological reflection required for 'depth'.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical and dogmatic foundations to reach the 20-minute threshold, allowing the text to breathe before rushing to application."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily by subordinating the specific Bible passage to a thematic socio-political narrative. While it excels in concrete application (Thesis 3), it lacks formal exegesis (Thesis 2) and fails the 20-minute depth requirement (Thesis 8). It functions more as a 'speech about the power of God' than a 'recreation of the Bible into a new proclamatory word'.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application: The preacher avoids 'general truths' and addresses specific cultural and political sins.",
      "Psychological/Sociological relevance: The sermon effectively addresses the 'zeitgeist' and the collective misery of the oppressed."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specific exegesis: The original context of the Passover and the Mount of Olives is ignored.",
      "Thematic drift: The sermon becomes a discourse on 'the gospel' as a principle of justice rather than an exposition of Matthew 26:30.",
      "Insufficient length: The duration does not allow for the 'breadth' Dekker demands."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "According to Dekker’s strict formal definition, this is not a sermon. It is an eloquent religious speech that uses a biblical motif to address a political crisis. It lacks the necessary grounding in the specific, unique content of the pericope and fails to maintain the tension between exposition and application."
