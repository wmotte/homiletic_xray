    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative games. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, engaging the listeners' capacity for reflection and change. By validating fear (NP) and celebrating joy (FC), the preacher creates a safe environment for the congregation to move away from the 'Adapted Child' (timidity/compliance) toward a responsible, autonomous future. The use of 'we' instead of 'you' prevents the preacher from slipping into a Persecutor role.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of Adult-to-Adult transparency regarding social change.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The call for 'major dollars' at the end could be perceived as a sudden shift to a Parent imperative.",
      "Ensure the 'forgetting' doesn't inadvertently encourage the 'careless amnesia' he previously critiqued."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' to maintain the Adult-Adult contract. When suggesting specific actions (like giving money), frame them as 'Adult' options for mission rather than 'Parental' requirements for faithfulness."
