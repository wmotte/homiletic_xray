    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes concrete, sensory imagery to ground theological concepts. The preacher successfully 'paints the picture' of the Galilean shore, moving beyond abstract definitions of love to the 'smell of the sea' and 'odor of fresh-caught fish.' The metaphor of the 'jar of keys' serves as an effective opening hook, providing a tactile entry point into the mystery of life. However, some images, like the 'storm' or 'fire of love,' lean toward traditional homiletical tropes. The strength lies in the 'cinematic' quality of the biblical reconstruction, where Peter is seen warming himself by the fire. The imagery is effective because it connects the biblical past with the visceral reality of the hearer's present, particularly in the description of the mother's sacrifice.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is clear and accessible, intentionally avoiding high-academic jargon. The preacher practices 'stewardship of language' by defining the 'Key' not as a formula, but as a Person. There is a rhythmic precision in the repetition of 'I know who,' which gives the language a cumulative power. However, there are moments of generalization, such as 'the world looks for what's wrong in us,' which lack the nuance McEntyre advocates for. The use of 'Canaanite' language is minimal, though 'social gospelists' and 'disembodied Christianity' function as shorthand that might require more precision for a modern audience. The transition between the Mother's Day theme and the Christological focus is handled with care, though it occasionally feels like two separate sermons joined by the word 'love.'",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest linguistic strength. The text exhibits a distinct 'cadence' and 'rhythm' characteristic of the great African American rhetorical tradition. The use of parallelism ('I know who... I know who...') creates a liturgical 'flow' that builds toward a crescendo. The variation in sentence length—moving from short, staccato questions to longer, flowing affirmations—demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the sermon as an oral event. The repetition of 'Lovest thou me?' mirrors the biblical text's own rhythm, creating a sense of 'musicality' that makes the message memorable. It is clearly 'ear language,' not 'paper language.'",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon's language is characterized by a rhythmic, oral quality that prioritizes relational impact over academic precision. It uses concrete imagery—the jar of keys, the fishing gear, the mother's door—to ground the 'Key to It All' in lived experience. While it occasionally flirts with homiletical clichés, the 'stewardship of language' is evident in its clarity and the powerful use of repetition. It is a 'musical' text that moves the listener through sound and cadence as much as through logic."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'Lowry-esque' movement from an initial 'upsetting of equilibrium' (the jar of unknown keys) to a resolution in the 'Who.' The narrative arc is generally strong, particularly in the way it links Peter's failure to the hearer's own anxieties. However, the structure is somewhat episodic. The transition to the Mother's Day section feels like a secondary arc that threatens to divert the primary movement of the Peter-Jesus dialogue. The 'turning point'—the realization that love is the prerequisite for service—is clear, but the energy dips slightly during the middle section on 'social gospelists' before rising again in the final personal testimony. It is more of a 'dynamic journey' than a 'three-point' lecture, but the path is occasionally winding.",
      "quotes": [
        "I'm scared — ignorance makes me scared — to throw one of them away.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels at 'reframing' (Cilliers). It takes the ancient dialogue of John 21 and frames it within the context of modern anxiety, the Great Depression, and the universal experience of maternal love. The preacher respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the three-fold question) while making it immediately relevant to the 'chilled love' of a contemporary congregation. The integration of the 'fishing gear' as a metaphor for returning to old, safe habits is a creative synthesis of text and context. The sermon doesn't just 'apply' the text; it allows the text to look at the context of the 1930s and the 1980s through the lens of grace.",
      "quotes": [
        "All of this fishing gear that you've brought out from storage... the business that you used to be in.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "In terms of Stark's 'open work of art,' the sermon is somewhat 'closed.' It moves toward a very specific, traditional conclusion: 'The Lord will make a way.' While this is comforting, it leaves little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or for those whose 'How' was never answered by a 'Who' in a way they could perceive. The sermon is 'monovalent' in its insistence on a happy ending ('all things work together for good'). While it acknowledges 'despair' and 'storms,' these are quickly resolved by the maternal and divine 'Who.' It functions more as a 'witness' (Long) than an 'open work' (Stark), providing a firm testimony rather than an interpretive space for doubt.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you can get that central matter straight, everything else, sooner or later, will fall in place.",
        "I can fix everything right if you care about me.",

        "Invite the hearer to interpret their own 'jar of keys' rather than providing the single answer immediately."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent; a 'closed' structure of testimony that seeks to persuade through certainty."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon's structure is a narrative journey that moves from the 'mystery' of life's locks to the 'certainty' of the Divine Person. It successfully integrates biblical exegesis with personal and historical narrative, creating a powerful arc of tension that culminates in a testimony of faith. While the 'Mother's Day' theme occasionally creates a secondary focus, the overarching movement is toward the 'Who' of the Gospel. However, the structure is relatively 'closed,' offering a definitive answer that leaves little room for the 'not yet' or the 'unanswered' tensions of faith."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon narrowly avoids 'religious kitsch' by grounding its hope in the 'pain of suffering' (the Depression, the death of a father). It does not offer 'immediate comfort' without acknowledging the 'chilled night' of Peter's denial or the 'broken heart' of a widow. However, the repeated refrain 'The Lord will make a way' and the idealized portrayal of mothers ('mothers look for what is right in us') flirt with sentimentality. The 'happy ending' is presented as an absolute certainty, which Cilliers warns can block true encounter with the Holy if it ignores the 'despair' it claims to resolve. It stays authentic because the preacher's own 'world collapsed,' but the rhetorical resolution is almost too 'neat.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The idealized generalization that mothers 'never' see bad in their children.",

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'reframing' of Peter's failure. By emphasizing that Jesus does not ask for an 'explanation' or 'reasoning' for the failure, but only for 'love,' the preacher creates a 'space for grace' that is not dependent on human performance. The 'Who' vs 'How' distinction is a classic aesthetic move that shifts the burden from the hearer to the Divine Actor (Immink). However, the space is slightly 'closed' by the moralizing section on church attendance, which frames love as a 'task' or a 'temperature' that the hearer must maintain.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained in the narrative of the Depression, but resolved perhaps too quickly in the theological conclusion.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'Who' respects the mystery of God's personhood over mechanical 'How' solutions.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the Peter narrative; moralization appears in the application regarding church loyalty.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'Feed my sheep' command to remain a daunting, grace-dependent mystery rather than a 'job' that follows a 'straightened out' life."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of the 'Narrative-Dramatic' style, rooted in the African American homiletical tradition. Its aesthetic power lies in its 'musicality' and its ability to 'reframe' biblical scenes into visceral, personal experiences. The preacher effectively uses the 'jar of keys' and the 'fishing gear' to move the congregation from the abstract to the concrete. The sermon's greatest strength is its 'performance' of faith—the rhythmic build-up toward the testimony of the 'Who.' Aesthetically, it functions as a 'witness' (Long), where the preacher's own life becomes the 'canvas' upon which the Gospel is painted. However, it falls short of the highest scores due to a tendency toward 'closed' structures and occasional 'sentimental' generalizations about motherhood. It prioritizes emotional resonance and 'consolatio' (consolation) over the 'polyvalence' of an open work of art. It is a sermon of 'sober beauty' that finds its aesthetic peak in the simplicity of a child's question and a mother's faithful response.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rhythmic and musical use of language (Anaphora/Parallelism).",

    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically effective 'event' that succeeds in 'opening space for grace' through the power of narrative and rhythm. While it leans toward a 'closed' and occasionally 'sentimental' structure, its authentic grounding in human suffering and divine restoration makes it a compelling piece of homiletic art. It is a sermon that 'shows' the Who of the Gospel through the 'how' of a life lived in the storm."
