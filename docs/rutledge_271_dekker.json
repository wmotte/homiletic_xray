  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on a single pericope. It oscillates between the Matthew narrative and the Revelation text. It treats the Bible as a collection of 'themes' (Epiphany, kingship) rather than recreating a specific passage into a new, current word. It relies on 'general truths' about the Magi rather than what the Revelation text says that can be found nowhere else.",
      "quotes": [
        "Everything he wants us to know is in the story of the Magi.",
        "Here, I believe, is a way for us to understand something of what Matthew wants us to see."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select either Matthew 2 or Revelation 21. If Revelation 21, the preacher must ask: why is the absence of a temple and the presence of the Lamb's lamp specific to this text, rather than using it as a lens for a different story?"
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates historical-critical awareness regarding the Zoroastrian origins of the Magi and the later traditions of the church. However, the exegesis of the Revelation text is thin, serving more as a thematic bridge than a rigorous exposition of the Greek text or the context of the seven churches.",
      "quotes": [
        "Originally they were a caste of Zoroastrian priests, but by Jesus’ time the term Magi had a broader application.",
        "Early Christian Biblical interpretation attached the prophetic passages to Matthew’s story."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exegesis of the Revelation passage. What does it mean for 'kings' to bring glory to a city with no temple in the context of the Roman Empire?"

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application touches on the 'zeitgeist' (secularism, religious smorgasbord), which Dekker values. However, it often lapses into generalities about 'intellectual courage' and 'following stars' rather than concrete, specific ethical or spiritual demands arising from the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "The mood in America today is hostile to the vision of Isaiah and Matthew.",
        "We must follow whatever star is given to us."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the metaphor of 'following stars' and instead apply the specific 'glory of the nations' from Revelation to the concrete cultural life of the congregation."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured as a lecture followed by a moral appeal. The first half is historical/exegetical 'information' about the Magi, while the latter half is application. The 'present' of revelation is hindered by this separation.",
      "quotes": [
        "Who were these Magi? Matthew doesn’t explain...",
        "As you know, I have spent most of my ministry in New York City..."

      "improvement_point": "Integrate the contemporary struggle with secularism directly into the reading of the text, so the text 'expounds' the hearer."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon addresses misery (the 'gathering gloom' and the 'un-ness' of the ungodly) and redemption (the Lamb). However, it leans toward an 'objective' Christocentrism that Dekker warns against if it ignores the human subject's specific misery.",
      "quotes": [
        "The baby sought by the Wise Men was born to save... those who are not the chosen.",
        "Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume Breathes a life of gathering gloom."

      "improvement_point": "Make the 'misery' more personal to the hearer's current experience of being 'lost in time' rather than just a theological category."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher mentions 'taking a stand before Herod' and the hostility of the world, which hints at the two ways. However, the ultimate 'possibility of being lost' is softened by a general inclusivity of 'everything beautiful' being taken into the kingdom.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are all going to have to take our stand before Herod.",
        "There are many false Messiahs in the world."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is strongly Christocentric. Christ is the telos. The preacher explicitly affirms the divinity of Christ and the doctrine of the two natures (God incarnate), which Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "His death would have passed forgotten had he not been God incarnate.",
        "Everything that is honorable... will be taken up into the kingdom of Christ."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure Christ is the telos of the *specific* text (Revelation 21) rather than a general theological conclusion added at the end."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1450 words, the sermon likely lasts 14-15 minutes. According to Dekker's Thesis 8, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for 'depth'.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exposition and application to meet the 20-minute minimum to allow the text to truly breathe."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily due to its lack of focus on a specific Bible passage and its insufficient length. It functions more as a thematic reflection on Epiphany than an 'exposition and application' of a single pericope. While it correctly identifies the zeitgeist and maintains a strong Christological focus, it separates exposition from application, resulting in a lecture-like structure.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christological foundation, affirming the divinity of Christ as the telos of the sermon.",
      "Adequate awareness of the contemporary cultural context (secularism and occultism)."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Fails the 20-minute rule, lacking the necessary breadth for homiletical depth.",
      "Lacks a specific pericope; it treats Scripture as a thematic resource rather than a singular proclamatory word.",
      "Separation of exegesis and application into distinct blocks."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an informative religious speech, but it is not a sermon in the strict sense of Dekker's definition. It lacks the specificity of the 'NOWHERE else' principle and the formal requirement of length."
