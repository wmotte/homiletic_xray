    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily through the lens of archaeology and a specific personal anecdote. The 'digs' and 'holes in the dike' provide a visual framework for the intellectual struggle between faith and skepticism. However, the imagery remains largely functional rather than evocative. While Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' is attempted in the funeral story, the theological core of the sermon relies heavily on abstract propositional logic ('If A, then B'). The sensory potential of the Resurrection—the 'first fruits', the 'stench of death' vs. the 'new life'—is mentioned but not fully 'painted' for the listener's mind. It is more of a mental picture than a sensory experience.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and exhibits high stewardship. The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' while maintaining theological depth. There is a clear effort to define terms and contexts (e.g., explaining the significance of Paul’s letters being earlier than the Gospels). The prose is economical; every sentence serves the progression of the argument. The preacher treats the audience as intellectually mature, engaging with archaeological scholarship without becoming academic. This aligns with McEntyre’s 'caring for words'—the language is honest about the 'unbelievable claims' of the faith rather than smoothing them over with religious platitudes.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a strong rhetorical cadence, particularly in the sections where the preacher echoes Paul’s 'if/then' logic. There is a rhythmic build-up toward the end, moving from the staccato of the archaeological 'facts' to the legato of the funeral story and the final doxology. The use of the Gershwin refrain provides a musical 'leitmotif' that anchors the sermon. However, some sections feel a bit 'paper-heavy'—particularly the long block quotes from Galatians and 1 Corinthians, which can disrupt the oral flow if not performed with great care. The ending, however, achieves a poetic quality that resonates with the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed tradition.",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' and intellectual precision. It avoids the fluff of religious kitsch in favor of a direct, honest engagement with the text. While the imagery is more functional than evocative, the stewardship of language is high. The preacher uses a clear, rhythmic prose that respects the hearer's intelligence. The musicality is most evident in the rhetorical climaxes, where the repetition of themes creates a sense of inevitability and weight. It is a text that values truth over decoration, yet finds beauty in the clarity of that truth."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Lowry-esque' plot: it begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' (the archaeological debunking of the Bible), moves into the 'clutter' of Paul’s difficult claims, reaches a 'turning point' in the personal story of Cook Kimball, and concludes with a 'new equilibrium' of faith. The movement from 'It ain't necessarily so' (skepticism) to 'It is so' (revelation) is a classic dramaturgical journey. The tension is well-maintained, as the preacher doesn't resolve the archaeological problem with easy answers, but reframes the entire question around the event of the Resurrection.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now, forty years later, the whole thing has been reversed.",
        "But now let us be realistic. The point of view expressed in the book review is now so widely held...",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. It masterfully 'reframes' (Cilliers) the contemporary crisis of biblical authority. Instead of defending the historicity of Solomon (which the preacher concedes might be 'just a local chieftain'), the sermon shifts the frame to the 'event' of the Resurrection. It connects the 1950s archaeological optimism, the 21st-century skepticism, and the 1st-century Corinthian struggle into a single narrative of God’s intervention. The 'context' of the Pokemon-playing children and the 'text' of Paul’s defense are synthesized to show that the challenge of faith is perennial, not just modern.",

        "Honest engagement with modern archaeology without being defensive.",
        "Brilliant use of the Gershwin song to bridge high theology and popular culture.",
        "The 'reframing' of the Bible as 'revelation' rather than 'imagination' is central and effective."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Could explore the 'context' of the Corinthian church more deeply to show the parallels with today.",
        "The 'Pokemon' example feels slightly dated and could be more nuanced.",
        "Ensure the 'reframing' doesn't feel like a dismissal of historical questions, but an elevation of them."

      "reframing_present": "Yes, the sermon successfully reframes the Bible from a historical 'product' to a divine 'event'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is somewhat 'closed' in its rhetorical force. While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' through the death of Cook Kimball, the final movement is a forceful, almost dogmatic assertion: 'It is so.' Following Ciska Stark’s 'open work of art,' one might argue the sermon doesn't leave much room for the hearer to struggle with the 'unbelievable' nature of the claims—it demands a 'do-or-die' response. However, the use of the Kimball story provides a 'human entry point' that prevents the sermon from being a purely closed system of truths. It invites the hearer to stand where Cook stood.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is it, Corinthians. It's this or nothing.",
        "uncompromising do-or-die, either-or quality",

        "The use of a personal story allows for subjective appropriation.",
        "The 'mystery' of the Resurrection is preserved by calling it 'against all human imagining'.",

        "Reduce the 'either-or' rhetoric to allow more space for the 'honest doubter'.",
        "The conclusion could benefit from an open question rather than a series of declarations.",
        "Acknowledge the 'resistance' (Stark) that a modern hearer might feel toward such 'staggering' claims."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Leans toward a 'closed' work due to its strong rhetorical assertions, but remains 'open' through its narrative elements."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is robust, moving from a well-defined problem to a narrative-driven resolution. The integration of text and context is sophisticated, using the concept of 'reframing' to move the conversation from archaeological proof to the 'event' of revelation. While the structure is somewhat monovalent in its 'either-or' logic, the inclusion of the Cook Kimball story provides a necessary aesthetic and emotional anchor. It is a well-paced journey that respects the gravity of the subject matter while maintaining a clear sense of direction and purpose."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a masterclass in avoiding religious kitsch. It does not offer 'immediate comfort' or 'pre-chewed emotions.' The death of Cook Kimball is treated with gravity—it is a 'tremendous blow' and he died 'before he could receive the kidney.' There is no 'happy ending' in the worldly sense; the resolution is found only in the 'miraculous intervention' of God. The preacher avoids the cliché of 'Jesus is the answer' by first establishing the 'unbelievable' nature of the claim. The use of a secular song ('It Ain't Necessarily So') further distances the sermon from the 'stained-glass' language of kitsch.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None identified; the sermon actively deconstructs kitsch-like 'inspirational sayings'.",
      "The mention of 'Noah with his ark full of animals' is used to illustrate a lack of depth, not to provide it."

      "The description of the 'uncompromising do-or-die' quality of Paul's argument.",
      "The 'odd thing' of Cook Kimball reading his own funeral lesson—presented as a mystery, not a magic trick."

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened primarily through the 'reframing' of the Resurrection as a 'miraculous revelation' that is 'against all human possibility.' By emphasizing that we do not 'imagine' it or 'need' it into existence, the preacher creates a space where grace is a sovereign act of God, not a human psychological projection. However, the 'either-or' logic slightly constricts this space by creating a high-pressure rhetorical environment. The 'mystery' is respected, but the 'ambivalence' of the hearer could be given more room to breathe.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'archaeological fact' and 'revelatory truth' is sustained throughout the first half.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, the Resurrection is presented as an event that transcends human expectation.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the sermon is about what God has done, not what we must do (though it calls for 'holding fast').",
    "recommendation": "To create more space, allow for a moment of 'silent wonder' or 'holy insecurity' before the final 'It is so' declarations."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high level of homiletic aesthetics, particularly within the 'New Homiletic' and Reformed traditions. Its primary strength lies in its 'stewardship of language' and its ability to 'reframe' a complex intellectual problem (biblical skepticism) into a narrative of divine event. The preacher avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by refusing to offer easy answers or sentimental comforts. Instead, the beauty of the sermon is found in its 'sober clarity' and the dramatic weight of the Cook Kimball story. While the imagery is more functional than poetic, and the rhetorical structure is somewhat 'closed' by its logical rigor, the sermon successfully creates a 'space for grace' by pointing away from human imagination toward the 'miraculous revelation' of God. It is an intellectually stimulating and emotionally grounded 'performance' of the Gospel that respects both the biblical text and the modern context.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Sophisticated 'reframing' of the conflict between archaeology and faith.",
      "Complete absence of religious kitsch; high intellectual and emotional honesty.",
      "Powerful use of narrative (the Cook Kimball story) to ground abstract theology."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase the use of sensory, 'showing' language in the theological core.",
      "Soften the 'either-or' logical structure to allow more room for the hearer's own process.",

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed with Narrative-Dramatic elements.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Witness' model of Thomas Long.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'thinking' Christians and 'honest skeptics' who value intellectual integrity and narrative depth over emotionalism.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'open' endings that leave the hearer in the 'inter-esse' (Cilliers).",
      "Try to 'paint' the biblical scenes with more sensory detail (Wilson).",
      "Use shorter, more punchy scriptural 'echoes' rather than long readings."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'preaching as witness.' It does not seek to entertain or manipulate, but to 'frame' reality in the light of the Resurrection. Its beauty is found in its precision, its honesty, and its refusal to settle for kitsch. While it leans toward a didactic 'closedness,' the narrative power of the ending successfully opens a 'space for grace' that invites the hearer into the mystery of the 'miraculous intervention' of God."
