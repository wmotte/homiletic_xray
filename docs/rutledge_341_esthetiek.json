    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon relies heavily on the central biblical image of 'darkness,' but it treats this image more as a theological category than a sensory experience. While it successfully evokes the 'stench' of the biblical world through intertextual references (Genesis, Amos), the preacher's own descriptions remain somewhat abstract. The critique of Holman Hunt’s painting shows an aesthetic awareness, yet the sermon itself struggles to 'show' the darkness of Calvary beyond quoting Scripture. The imagery is effective because the biblical texts quoted are vivid, but the homiletical 'painting' of the scene is secondary to the explanation of the symbol. It functions more as an iconographic analysis than a cinematic immersion.",
      "quotes": [
        "The eclipse over Calvary signifies the presence in human form of the Almighty Creator God himself.",
        "A prettified Jesus with a glow around his head is puny and sentimental compared to Scripture.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Predominantly 'telling.' The preacher explains the significance of the signs rather than letting the narrative details evoke the experience."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably precise and avoids the 'Canaanite' jargon often found in Reformed preaching. The preacher uses clear, forceful English. There is a high degree of 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre), particularly in the way theological concepts like 'judgment' and 'chaos' are handled without becoming clichéd. The distinction between the 'Jesus-bashers' and the 'living Lord' is sharp and rhetorically effective. The word choice is economical; there is little fluff. However, the structure is somewhat academic, which occasionally leads to a more didactic than evocative tone.",

        "The transition between the newsmagazine introduction and the biblical text is slightly abrupt.",
        "Some sentences are structurally repetitive (e.g., 'The second meaning...', 'The third meaning...').",
        "Could benefit from more 'loving language' (McEntyre) to balance the heavy focus on judgment."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Theological terms like 'revelation' and 'judgment' are used but are contextualized within the narrative of the signs, making them clear rather than obscure."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a steady, dignified cadence suitable for a Good Friday liturgy. There is a liturgical 'weight' to the sentences. However, the rhythm is somewhat hampered by the didactic 'three meanings' structure, which creates a predictable, almost classroom-like tempo. The most musical moment occurs during the Satanic monologue, where the staccato questions create a sense of mounting pressure. Overall, it is 'oral' in the sense of being a clear address, but it lacks the poetic 'legato' that might elevate it to a higher aesthetic plane.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Way, the Truth, and the Life.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "Vary the structural markers (First, Second, Third) to avoid a monotonous rhythm.",
        "Use more alliteration or assonance to make key theological phrases more memorable.",
        "Incorporate more rhythmic variation between the long exegetical explanations and short, punchy applications."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Primarily oral language, though the structural rigidity betrays a strongly written outline."
    },
    "average_score_language": 6.33,
    "summary_language": "The language of the sermon is characterized by a 'sober beauty.' It avoids the pitfalls of sentimentalism and jargon, opting instead for a precise, almost architectural use of words. While it lacks high poetic flair, its strength lies in its clarity and its ability to re-appropriate biblical imagery without falling into cliché. The 'stewardship of language' is evident in the careful handling of difficult concepts like divine judgment. It is a text written for the ear, but one that prioritizes instruction and 'witness' (Long) over pure aesthetic experience."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a traditional, somewhat static 'three-point' structure. While it attempts to create an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' by referencing the Jesus Seminar, this feels more like an intellectual hook than a narrative tension. The 'plot' is essentially an unfolding of definitions. There is a movement toward the 'final onslaught of Satan,' which provides a climax of sorts, but the energy is fragmented by the categorical divisions. It lacks the 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry) that moves from a shared itch to a gospel scratch; it is more of a guided tour through a gallery of meanings.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let us attend, then, to what Matthew, Mark, and Luke would teach us...",
        "The second meaning of the darkness can best be understood by...",
        "That is the third meaning of the darkness."

        "Clear logical progression that is easy for the hearer to follow.",
        "The final section creates a genuine sense of dramatic confrontation.",
        "The introduction successfully situates the sermon within a contemporary intellectual conflict."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Transform the 'three meanings' into a single narrative movement or 'journey.'",
        "Create more tension between the points rather than treating them as isolated silos.",
        "The conclusion feels like a cliffhanger (intentional for a series), but needs more resolution for a standalone event."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "Static three-point structure. It functions as an expository lecture with a dramatic finale."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong point. The preacher effectively 'reframes' (Cilliers) the contemporary skepticism of the Jesus Seminar by placing it against the 'living Lord' of the liturgy. The integration of Old Testament 'Day of the Lord' motifs with the New Testament event of the Cross is handled with theological sophistication. The sermon does not just repeat the text; it uses the text to challenge the hearer's perception of reality (e.g., the 'judgment' on our society's greed). It respects the 'strangeness' of the darkness as a cosmic event rather than a mere weather report.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are being invited to trust instead in various modern scholars who... prefer their own individual versions of Jesus.",
        "The eclipse over Calvary summons us... to confess our sins at the foot of the Cross.",
        "In the darkness on Golgotha, therefore, the creation goes into mourning for its Maker."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Successful 'reframing' of the Cross as a cosmic and judicial event rather than just a personal tragedy.",
        "Strong connection between ancient prophecy and contemporary social confession (greed, injustice).",
        "The sermon honors the 'otherness' of the biblical world."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The application to 'greed and injustices' is a bit general; more concrete 'reframing' of local context would help.",
        "Bridge the gap between the 'scholarly' debate in the intro and the 'devotional' tone of the end more smoothly.",
        "Explore how the 'darkness' manifests in the modern world beyond just intellectual doubt."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes. It reframes the Cross from a 'fabrication' to a cosmic 'judgment' and 'mourning' of creation."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is relatively 'closed' in its theological assertions, which is typical of a 'Witness' style of preaching (Long). It provides definitive answers to the 'three meanings.' However, it leaves an 'open' space at the very end by stopping at the 'outermost boundary' of death without rushing to a cheap Easter resolution. This 'openness' to the tension of Good Friday is an aesthetic virtue. It treats the hearer as a mature partner in a theological battle, though it doesn't allow much room for polyvalent interpretations of the 'darkness' itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "These are the wrong questions. In order to understand... we must go back...",
        "It is our proper part, this day, to think of our own disobedience...",
        "In this final onslaught... we learn what is the outermost boundary..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Resists the urge to provide a 'happy ending' too early, sustaining the tension of the Cross.",
        "Invites the hearer into a communal act of repentance rather than just individual moralizing.",
        "The ending is powerful because it remains in the 'black hour.'"
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The phrase 'These are the wrong questions' is quite closed/authoritative; try inviting the hearer to see why other questions might be more fruitful.",
        "Allow for more 'ambivalence' (Cilliers) regarding the experience of God's silence in the darkness.",
        "Create space for the hearer to find their own meaning within the 'darkness' metaphor."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Monovalent but structurally open. It insists on specific meanings but leaves the 'event' of the darkness unresolved at the end."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is traditionally homiletical, relying on a didactic three-point movement that prioritizes clarity over narrative flow. While this makes the sermon easy to follow, it limits the 'dramaturgical' potential of the Passion story. The strength of the structure lies in its refusal to resolve the tension of the Cross prematurely, effectively creating a 'Space for Grace' by lingering in the judgment and darkness. It is an 'event' of teaching that moves toward an 'event' of dramatic confrontation at the end."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a strong antidote to religious kitsch. The preacher explicitly attacks 'sentimental' and 'prettified' versions of Jesus (referencing Holman Hunt). By focusing on 'judgment,' 'wrath,' and 'chaos,' the sermon avoids the 'cheap comfort' that Cilliers warns against. The emotions evoked are not 'pre-chewed' but are rooted in the harsh reality of the biblical text and the gravity of sin. The 'Satanic whisper' section could risk being kitsch if handled poorly, but here it serves to heighten the genuine 'trouble' of the Cross.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'prettified Jesus with a glow around his head' (cited as an example of what to avoid).",
      "The potential for a 'happy ending' which the preacher successfully avoids."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The acknowledgment of the 'scientific and textual impossibilities' of the eclipse, moving toward a deeper truth.",
      "The refusal to move past the 'black hour' at the end of the sermon."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Continue to lean into the 'strangeness' and 'harshness' of the gospel to maintain this high level of authenticity."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened primarily through the 'Reframing' of the darkness as God's own mourning and judgment. By moving away from 'scientific' questions, the preacher opens a phenomenological space where the hearer can encounter the 'Holy' as a cosmic reality. However, the 'three-point' didacticism occasionally 'closes' the space by making the experience feel like a lesson to be learned rather than a mystery to be inhabited. The 'Space for Grace' is most palpable in the silence of the 'unresolved' ending.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between the 'powers of death' and the 'Son of God' is sustained until the final sentence.",
    "mystery_respected": "Partially. The preacher explains the 'meanings' of the sign, which slightly diminishes the mystery, but the cosmic scale of the explanation restores a sense of awe.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails as a cosmic act of God, though it is preceded by a necessary and sharp call to repentance (judgment).",
    "recommendation": "To create more space, allow the biblical images to 'breathe' more before immediately assigning them a numbered 'meaning.'"
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a robust example of 'Sober-Reformed' aesthetics. Its primary strength lies in its intellectual and theological integrity, refusing to succumb to the sentimental kitsch often associated with Passion Tide. The preacher acts as a 'Witness' (Long), pointing away from themselves and toward the 'cosmic drama' of the Cross. Aesthetically, it functions through 'reframing'—taking a familiar story and placing it within the vast, dark frame of Old Testament prophecy and cosmic chaos. While the language is precise and the imagery is biblically grounded, the sermon is structurally rigid. The 'three meanings' approach, while clear, prevents the sermon from becoming a truly 'open work of art' (Stark). It feels more like a high-quality theological lecture that breaks into a dramatic performance in its final act. The 'Space for Grace' is found in the sermon's gravity and its refusal to offer easy answers to the reality of evil.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Anti-sentimentalism: A sharp, successful critique of religious kitsch.",
      "Theological Reframing: Connecting contemporary skepticism to cosmic biblical truths.",
      "Dignified Tone: A consistent, sober atmosphere that respects the liturgical occasion."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Dramaturgical Flow: Moving beyond the 'three-point' lecture format toward a more integrated narrative arc.",
      "Sensory Immersion: Increasing 'showing' over 'telling' to make the darkness palpable.",
      "Rhythmic Variation: Breaking the predictable cadence of the didactic sections."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Expository-Witness",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Thomas G. Long's 'Witness' model and Johan Cilliers' emphasis on 'Reframing' and 'Anti-Kitsch.'",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'thinking' Christians who are weary of sentimentalism and seek a cognitively demanding, liturgically serious encounter with Scripture.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a 'Lowry Loop' structure to create more narrative tension.",
      "Use more 'staccato' sentences during moments of high theological drama.",
      "Incorporate a contemporary 'image' or 'parable' that mirrors the cosmic darkness described in the text."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically 'good' (6.5) piece of homiletic work. It excels in 'Stewardship of Language' and 'Reframing,' providing a necessary weight to the Good Friday message. It falls short of 'excellent' (8+) only because its form is somewhat subservient to a traditional classroom logic, which occasionally stifles the poetic and performative potential of the 'Darkness at Noonday.' It is a sermon that commands respect and reflection, effectively opening a space for the 'Holy' by taking the 'Darkness' seriously."
