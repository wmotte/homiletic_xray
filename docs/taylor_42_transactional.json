        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "While the sermon uses 'must' and 'should,' it lacks the shaming quality of a toxic CP. The 'musts' are framed as athletic requirements for a goal the listener is assumed to want, rather than threats of damnation.",

          "We need steel and determination",

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The sermon avoids games like NIGYSOB or ITHY by being honest about the difficulty of the task. Instead of promising a 'quick fix' (the Con), the preacher warns that the process is 'muscular' and 'formidable.' By removing the false promise, the 'Switch' to disappointment or blame is avoided."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely free of manipulative games. It utilizes a healthy Nurturing Parent to validate the listener's exhaustion while calling upon the Adult to make a conscious decision to 'press on.' The transition into Free Child imagery at the end provides an emotional 'payoff' that is inspirational rather than exploitative. It acknowledges the harsh realities of the listeners' lives (referencing race and poverty) without trapping them in a Victim role.",
    "strengths": [
      "Authentic identification with the listener's struggle.",
      "Avoidance of 'Bait & Switch'—honesty about the difficulty of the Christian life.",
      "Strong use of Free Child imagery to provide hope."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Could incorporate more Adult-to-Adult data processing regarding *how* to 'press on' in practical, daily terms.",
      "Heavy reliance on the 'Parent' voice can occasionally foster dependency on the preacher's encouragement."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To maintain this high level of health, continue to share personal 'Adult' struggles where the goal wasn't reached, ensuring the 'Parent' voice doesn't become an unattainable standard of perfection."
