    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience primarily through historical imagination and cultural parallels rather than personal anecdotes. It effectively bridges the gap between the ancient world and 1980s New York. However, it lacks a specific, immediate 'slice of life' from the hearer's current week, relying instead on the collective identity of the Catholic Worker movement. The emotional connection is built through the tension of the Daniel narrative.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength of the sermon. The preacher spends significant time analyzing the 'why' behind the human condition—specifically the pressure of cultural assimilation. He explores the problem of the 'absorbed church' and the psychological pressure to compromise. He pauses to ask deep questions about the nature of reality and power, challenging the hearer's perception of political events.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a clear theological framework for 'apocalyptic.' It defines the term precisely (*apocalypsis* as unveiling/invasion) and connects it to a broader biblical-theological thread. The 'big idea' is the dual-level reality: what is happening vs. what is *really* happening. The exegesis of Daniel 5 is solid, though it leans heavily on historical-critical background (Antiochus Epiphanes) to explain the text's logic.",

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the sermon is highly inspiring, it remains somewhat general in its call to action. It affirms the work already being done by the Catholic Worker ('You here... have known these things') but offers few specific 'next steps' for the individual hearer beyond a general call to 'bear witness' and 'see in the dark.' It functions more as encouragement than as a pragmatic guide.",

It succeeds in re-framing the hearer's worldview by providing a robust theological and historical framework for 'apocalyptic' thinking. It effectively diagnoses the 'absorbed church' and uses the narrative of Daniel 5 to create a vivid counter-reality. However, it falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase of Kolb's cycle. While it encourages an existing community of activists, it offers little in the way of concrete, practical application or specific ethical guidance for the 'how' of resistance. It is intellectually and imaginatively stimulating but pragmatically thin.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong diagnostic and visionary piece that excels in the 'Reflective Observation' and 'Abstract Conceptualization' phases of Kolb's cycle. It successfully challenges the 'absorbed' state of the modern church through a brilliant use of historical typology. Its primary limitation is its lack of pragmatic 'Active Experimentation.' For a community like the Catholic Worker, this may be a 'priestly' word of encouragement, but as a learning tool, it leaves the 'Hands' quadrant largely empty. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'unveiled vision' and the 'Monday morning' reality of the hearer."
