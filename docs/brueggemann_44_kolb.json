They do so because they know, intuitively, that stories of success and prosperity draw people, mobilize resources, generate jobs, accumulate wealth, and eventually—raise the standard [...] not the fashionable, urban agenda of wisdom, might, wealth, but the stuff that delights God, steadfast love, justice, righteousness. The Gospel to which the church testifies in the city may be put this way: Brag! But get it right! Delight in the delights of the God of neighborly fidelity. And then brag . . . endlessly!",

It connects the hearer's experience of modern city life (slogans, advertising, economic ambition) with the biblical text.

It falls short primarily in the 'Active Experimentation' phase of Kolb's cycle, where the transition from systemic social vision to concrete individual action is left vague. The sermon is highly structured, utilizing a 'triad' comparison that serves the 'Assimilating' learner well. It provides a deep 'Reflective Observation' on the nature of power and pride, using the history of Jerusalem as a mirror for modern cities like Atlanta. While the 'Normative' task (Osmer) is handled with prophetic clarity, the 'Pragmatic' task remains at the level of corporate witness rather than personal discipleship. The language is evocative and the logic is sound, but the lack of specific, personal application limits its impact on 'Accommodating' and 'Converging' learners.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "From a Kolb perspective, this sermon is a robust intellectual and reflective exercise that successfully moves the hearer from their concrete environment into a deep theological reflection. It excels at 'Reflective Observation' and 'Abstract Conceptualization,' providing a clear and compelling 'Normative' vision. However, the cycle remains incomplete because it fails to land in 'Active Experimentation' with sufficient specificity. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the grand social vision of 'justice and righteousness' and the specific, lived reality of the individual congregant. It is a strong 'Declarative' sermon that would benefit from more 'Pragmatic' and 'Narrative' depth."
