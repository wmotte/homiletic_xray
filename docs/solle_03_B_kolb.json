    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a sensory invitation to visualize a rainbow, attempting to ground the message in a shared natural phenomenon. However, the 'experience' remains largely imaginative rather than situational. It touches on the feeling of catastrophe ('Wasser und Zerstörung') but moves quickly into the biblical narrative. The connection to the hearer's life world is present through the mention of 'dauergeheizten Büro', yet it lacks a deep, specific narrative 'slice of life' that would allow for full emotional identification.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This phase is well-developed through a critical analysis of the human condition and modern society. The preacher pauses to ask why the earth is suffering, identifying 'Profitgier' and the 'westlich-fortschrittliche Gott der Unterwerfung' as the root causes. It offers a cultural critique by contrasting the biblical rhythm of nature with the artificiality of modern life. The 'problem' of ecological destruction is explored from a theological-societal perspective.",

        "Wir wissen alle, wie leicht es ist, die Erde zu verfluchen um der Profitgier willen, die tief im menschlichen Herzen steckt.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Theological depth is achieved through a specific interpretation of the 'Kriegsbogen' (war bow) becoming a 'Vertragssymbol' (covenant symbol). The exegesis focuses on the 'Umkehr' (turning) of God. However, the 'big idea' is somewhat diffused by the transition into Native American spirituality at the end. While the exegesis of Genesis is present, the logical connection between the biblical 'covenant' and the 'four directions' of the elements is more poetic than dogmatically rigorous.",

      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. The sermon remains largely in the realm of 'remembering' and 'imagining.' While it mentions the 'herzustellenden Frieden' (peace to be established), it provides no concrete action steps for the congregation. The call to 'remember the rainbow' is symbolic but lacks ethical specificity. The hearer is left with a vision but no clear 'how-to' for responding to the ecological crisis in daily life.",

It effectively critiques modern 'gods' of progress and reclaims the biblical rainbow as a sign of God's solidarity with a suffering earth. However, it fails to complete the Kolb cycle, leaving the 'Active Experimentation' phase largely untouched. The transition from biblical exegesis to Native American elemental wisdom is poetically evocative but logically thin. While it succeeds in shifting the hearer's 'gaze', it provides no 'handles' for the 'hands'. The result is a sermon that inspires reflection but risks remaining in the realm of abstract idealism.",

    "conclusion": "From a Kolb perspective, this sermon is a 'half-cycle' masterpiece of the Diverging style. It excels in opening the 'eyes' and touching the 'heart' through visionary and reflective tasks. However, its diagnostic profile reveals a significant deficit in the pragmatic and active phases. For a congregation facing the complexities of the ecological crisis, the sermon offers a beautiful 'why' and a profound 'what', but leaves the 'how' entirely to the hearer's own devices. To achieve holistic learning, the preacher must move beyond the role of the 'Artist' and occasionally embrace the role of the 'Guide'."
