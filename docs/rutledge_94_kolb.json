      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is notably weak in facilitating concrete, lived experience. It operates primarily in the realm of ideas and historical definitions. While it mentions recognizable things like 'sunsets' or 'Beyoncé', these are used as brief foils for theological points rather than immersive experiences. There is little to no identification with the 'life world' of the hearer; the focus remains on the 'text world' and 'theological world'. The emotional connection is sought through 'awe', but this is described abstractly rather than evoked through narrative.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher spends significant time analyzing the 'problem' of the modern eclipse of God's glory. There is a clear cultural critique regarding how 'glory' has been cheapened or misunderstood as subjective perception. The sermon pauses to ask 'why' we no longer feel the weight of the divine, pointing to the reduction of Jesus to a 'moral exemplar'. It looks at the human condition of 'uncleanness' in light of the 'Sanctus'.",

It moves from the Tome of Leo to Hebrew/Greek etymology, to the doctrine of aseity, and into the paradox of the Cross as glory. The 'big idea'—that God's glory is an objective, radiant power mediated through Christ—is logically developed and supported by a wide array of biblical and historical witnesses (Barth, Lewis, Herbert).",

While it calls for the church to 'recommit' to the praise of God's glory, it remains vague on how an individual hearer should implement this on Monday morning. The application is primarily internal/dispositional (enjoying God, repenting in dust and ashes) rather than ethical or practical.

It is characterized by intellectual depth, linguistic precision, and a strong sense of the 'normative' task of theology. However, it falls short of a complete learning cycle due to a lack of contemporary concrete experience and specific practical application. The preacher excels as an 'Advocate' and 'Philosopher' (Anderson), successfully defending the objective nature of God’s glory against modern subjectivity. The use of historical witnesses and poetry provides a visionary quality that prevents the sermon from becoming purely dry, yet the 'active experimentation' phase remains underdeveloped. The result is a sermon that informs and inspires the mind but offers few handles for the 'accommodating' or 'converging' learner who seeks to put faith into immediate practice.",

    "conclusion": "From a Kolb perspective, this sermon is a strong example of 'Assimilating' homiletics. It provides a rich, logical, and visionary framework for understanding the Epiphany. However, as a holistic learning event, it is incomplete. The priority for improvement is the 'lower half' of the Kolb cycle: Concrete Experience and Active Experimentation. By grounding these lofty theological truths in the 'dirt' of daily life and the 'sweat' of ethical action, the preacher would move from delivering a brilliant lecture to facilitating a transformative encounter. The sermon currently risks 'abstract idealism'—where the hearer agrees with the truth of God's glory but remains unchanged in their daily walk."
