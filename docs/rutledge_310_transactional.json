    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This is a remarkably healthy sermon from a TA perspective. It avoids the common trap of the 'Critical Parent' using a tragedy to shame listeners into faith. Instead, it uses the 'Adult' to validate the difficulty of belief. By admitting her own 'Child' fears and doubts, the preacher creates a safe, game-free space for the listener to exercise their own autonomy.",
    "strengths": [

      "The distinction between 'Religion' and 'Faith' is a common theological trope that can sometimes feel like a semantic game, though here it is handled with intellectual rigor."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'I-statements' regarding doubt. It prevents the congregation from feeling 'hunted' by a Critical Parent and encourages them to take Adult responsibility for their own faith."
