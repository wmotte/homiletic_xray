While it effectively uses narrative, it relies on the 'Critical Parent' to create a sense of guilt that only the 'Rescuer' (the preacher's theology) can solve. It reinforces a 'I'm Not OK - You're OK (God/Preacher)' dynamic.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as 'Adults' who can choose to follow Christ out of value-alignment rather than 'Adapted Children' who must be unmasked. Reduce the use of the 'Critical Parent' look and focus on 'Adult' reflection on grace."
