While it uses fear-based imagery (demonic possession) to motivate the 'Adapted Child,' it also provides a beautiful, aesthetic alternative through the story of Orpheus (Free Child). The primary psychological risk is the 'all-or-nothing' framing of commitment, which can create a 'Persecutor' dynamic for those struggling with doubt or complexity.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward a 10/10 health score, provide more 'Adult' data on what 'steadfast commitment' looks like in daily life, reducing the psychological 'Con' of the demonic threat in favor of authentic 'Free Child' attraction to the 'lovelier music'."
