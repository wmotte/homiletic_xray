    "logos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The rational architecture is built upon a sharp categorical distinction between 'immortality of the soul' (Hellenistic/Generic) and 'resurrection of the body' (Christian). The preacher follows a clear exegetical path through 1 Corinthians 15, using Paul’s own argumentative structure to support the claim. The logic is deductive: if Christ is not raised bodily, then faith is futile. The preacher successfully navigates the 'logical difficulty' Paul faces with natural analogies (seeds/bulbs), admitting where the logic of nature fails to meet the logic of revelation. The transition from the problem of the Corinthian 'spiritualization' to the evidence of the empty tomb is logically sound and traceable.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Corinthians thought that they had already gained immortality. They had a 'spiritualized' idea of the resurrection that bypasses the body.",
        "If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain... your faith is futile and you are still in your sins.",
        "The analogy doesn't really work, however, because flowers come up every spring... whereas the Resurrection was totally unexpected."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear categorical distinction between soul-immortality and body-resurrection.",
        "Honest engagement with the limitations of natural analogies.",
        "Traceable movement from biblical text to theological consequence."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition between the Archbishop of Canterbury anecdote and the Apostles' Creed is slightly abrupt.",
        "The explanation of the 'different body' (passing through doors vs. eating fish) remains logically paradoxical without further clarification.",
        "The conclusion shifts from argumentation to 'rapture' (ecstatic listing) which, while homiletically standard, weakens the logical thread."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Strong internal consistency based on a clear theological antithesis."
    },
    "pathos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The emotional resonance is achieved through concrete, visceral imagery rather than sentimentalism. The preacher intentionally subverts 'comfortable' Easter Pathos (peaceful women at the tomb) with 'terrified' Pathos (the Guatemalan card, the electric shock). This creates a sense of awe and 'trembling.' However, the sermon occasionally retreats into academic descriptions of emotions rather than evoking them directly. The use of the Rabin granddaughter and the Oklahoma City fireman provides a heavy emotional weight, anchoring the abstract 'body' in the 'warm hand' of human grief and longing. The tone is serious and celebratory but avoids manipulative highs.",
      "quotes": [
        "The hair of one is standing straight up as though she had received an electric shock. Another was throwing her pottery jar into the air as though it had suddenly become radioactive.",
        "The whole world was touched by the grief of his young granddaughter who wept that she would never feel his warm hands again.",
        "Can you imagine anything more wonderful than this? On the contrary, we can scarcely begin to imagine it."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of 'shocking' imagery to disrupt religious clichés.",
        "Strong connection between the doctrine of the body and the human need for physical touch.",
        "Appropriate variation in tone from academic to 'rapturous'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'Archbishop of Canterbury' opening is somewhat 'dry' and intellectual for an emotional hook.",
        "The list of 'all sins wiped away...' at the end feels slightly formulaic.",
        "The 'rapture' section could benefit from more sensory language to make the 'changed' state palpable."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Effective use of 'Awe' and 'Grief' to ground high theology, though occasionally reliant on external anecdotes for impact.",
      "emotional_tone": "Awe-struck and existential, moving from fear/astonishment to hopeful celebration."
    },
    "ethos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher establishes credibility as a 'sympathetic teacher' and a 'witness to the tradition.' By acknowledging the difficulty of the Easter sermon ('the most difficult of the year'), the preacher displays a humble vulnerability. The Ethos is that of a seasoned guide who understands the congregation's likely skepticism or 'spiritualized' tendencies. There is a clear sense of 'speaking from within' the tradition (referencing the Creeds and Prayer Books). However, the preacher remains somewhat of a 'distant teacher'—there is little personal confession of struggle with the doctrine, though there is professional honesty about the difficulty of preaching it.",
      "quotes": [
        "The preacher is sympathetic to Paul's predicament here.",
        "I'm sure that you remember the famous photograph...",
        "I remember when I was young in Virginia and a wise older person said..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Honesty about the difficulty of the subject matter.",
        "Credibility established through liturgical and historical rootedness.",
        "Avoidance of 'master of the text' persona in favor of 'fellow traveler' with Paul."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The preacher relies heavily on the authority of others (Archbishop, Paul, John Donne) rather than personal witness.",
        "The 'Virginia' anecdote is slightly detached; a more personal struggle with the 'body' would heighten Ethos.",
        "The tone is very 'clerical,' which can create a distance between the pulpit and the pew."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Authoritative yet sympathetic clerical Ethos that prioritizes the witness of the Church over personal testimony.",
      "authenticity": "High professional integrity and intellectual honesty, but low personal vulnerability."

  "rhetorical_balance_analysis": {
    "dominant_mode": "Logos",
    "suppressed_mode": "Ethos",
    "balance_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon is primarily an exercise in theological clarification (Logos). It seeks to correct a specific misunderstanding (immortality vs. resurrection). Pathos is used effectively as a secondary tool to make the 'body' matter to the hearer. Ethos is the most suppressed; the preacher functions as a reliable conduit for the message but does not 'put themselves on the line' in a way that risks personal vulnerability. The balance is that of a high-quality teaching sermon (didactic-homiletical).",
    "consequences_of_imbalance": [
      "The intellectual hearer is well-served by the clear distinctions, but the seeker looking for personal connection may find the preacher too distant.",
      "The heavy reliance on Logos makes the sermon feel like a 'correction' of a mistake rather than a 'proclamation' of a mystery at times.",
      "The lack of personal Ethos means the authority rests entirely on the text, which is safe but potentially less 'sticky' for a modern audience."
    ],
    "recommendation_for_balance": "Increase Ethos by sharing a personal moment where the 'resurrection of the body' (not just the soul) became a necessary hope for the preacher personally."

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is exceptionally orthodox, defending the specific Christian claim of bodily resurrection against neo-Platonic or generic spiritualizations."
    },
    "orthopathy_pathos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Awakens a sense of 'holy fear' and 'longing for touch,' which are appropriate affections for the Easter mystery, though it remains slightly cognitive."
    },
    "orthopraxy_ethos": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher models 'right thinking' and 'right liturgical practice,' but the call to 'right action' is largely missing, as the sermon focuses on the future hope."
    }
  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_rhetorical_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a strong, intellectually rigorous sermon that excels in clarifying a difficult and often misunderstood point of Christian doctrine. The preacher successfully dismantles the 'immortality of the soul' trope and replaces it with the 'resurrection of the body' using a combination of Pauline exegesis and visceral modern imagery (the fireman, the Guatemalan card). The Logos is the sermon's backbone, providing a clear and necessary theological correction. Pathos is used strategically to ensure the 'body' is not just a theological term but a human reality. However, the sermon maintains a certain 'clerical distance.' It is the work of a 'good man speaking well,' but it feels more like a lecture from the pulpit than a vulnerable witness from the heart. The rhetorical quality is high, but it lacks the 'piercing' quality that comes from high personal Ethos.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Sharp theological distinction between soul and body.",
      "Subversion of Easter clichés through 'shocking' imagery.",
      "Honest engagement with the 'ineffable' nature of the Resurrection."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase personal vulnerability (Ethos) to bridge the gap between teacher and hearer.",
      "Tighten the opening transition to hook the audience more effectively.",
      "Avoid the 'litany of blessings' at the end in favor of a more focused application."
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Didactic-Corrective",
    "audience_analysis": "Most appealing to 'the inner core of the faithful' and intellectually inclined congregants who value doctrinal precision.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with first-person narrative to increase Ethos.",
      "Use more sensory language in the 'heavenly' descriptions to boost Pathos.",
      "Connect the 'resurrection of the body' to a specific ethical 'orthopraxy' in the present."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A solid, 'B+' level sermon (in diagnostic terms, a 6.5-7) that fulfills its purpose of teaching the faith. It is rhetorically balanced toward Logos, making it an excellent teaching tool but perhaps less of a life-changing 'event' for the hearer. It is sober, business-like, and doctrinally sound."
