    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in sensory imagery, particularly when describing the physical reality of slavery and the Civil War. Proctor avoids abstract theological definitions of 'suffering' or 'sin,' opting instead for visceral, concrete details that Paul Scott Wilson would categorize as 'showing.' The imagery of 'colored rivulets' in a feeding trough or 'gnarled hands' from brickyards creates a cinematic quality that bridges the gap between the historical text and the hearer's imagination. The use of the 'Jacob's Ladder' metaphor serves as a vertical axis for the entire sermon, grounding the spiritual ascent in the physical labor of the ancestors.",
      "quotes": [
        "These children would gouge out their food, with the dirt from their hands making colored rivulets in the trough.",
        "Its mighty lakes, its clear sky, its broad rivers, its 'star-crowned mountains.'",
        "Their hands were gnarled from labor in the brickyards, the oil refineries, and the cane fields."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Proctor demonstrates high stewardship of language, as advocated by McEntyre. He avoids 'Canaanite' jargon, instead using a vocabulary that is both accessible and intellectually rigorous (e.g., 'amalgam,' 'dichotomy,' 'glossolalia'). His precision in naming diseases like 'pellagra' or specific historical figures adds a layer of truth-telling that resists the 'kitsch' of generalized historical sentiment. The language is loving yet uncompromising, doing justice to the complexity of the African American experience without falling into platitudes.",
      "quotes": [
        "The body threatened by dysentery, cholera, pneumonia, and that dread disease, pellagra.",
        "A dichotomy grew up between those who sought to become a part of the American society and those who refused.",

      "jargon_analysis": "Religious jargon is almost non-existent; theological concepts are translated into historical and social realities."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a rhythmic cadence typical of the African American homiletic tradition. Proctor uses parallelism and repetition ('being crushed but refusing to collapse, being destroyed but not disappearing') to build emotional momentum. The integration of spiritual lyrics ('I got shoes, you got shoes') provides a melodic counterpoint to the prose. The rhythm shifts from the staccato of historical facts to the legato of spiritual reflection, creating a 'flow' that is clearly intended for oral delivery rather than silent reading.",
      "quotes": [
        "Being crushed but refusing to collapse, being destroyed but not disappearing.",
        "We are climbing Jacob's ladder, we are climbing Jacob's ladder, we are climbing Jacob's ladder.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The middle section on church administration loses the rhythmic drive of the opening and closing.",
        "Some historical citations (e.g., Ken Burns, Daniel Mannix) break the lyrical flow.",
        "Could utilize more alliteration to heighten the poetic quality of the 'reframing' moments."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Predominantly oral language, though the sociological analysis occasionally leans toward a lecture style."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high degree of micro-aesthetic quality. Proctor's language is a sophisticated blend of historical precision and poetic imagery. By grounding the 'Jacob's Ladder' metaphor in the 'gnarled hands' and 'colored rivulets' of history, he avoids the trap of abstract spiritualization. The rhythm is deeply rooted in the Black Church tradition, using repetition and song to create a communal experience. While the middle section on institutional responsibility is more prosaic, the overall stewardship of language is exemplary, avoiding kitsch through the sheer weight of concrete, painful, and hopeful detail."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'homiletical plot' that moves from the 'trouble' of history to the 'grace' of resilience and local action. It begins by upsetting the equilibrium with the tragedy of the Civil War and the loss of institutions. The movement is not a simple three-point structure but a journey through history, sociology, and finally into the 'midair' of the Spirit. The tension is maintained by the contrast between the 'loathing' of slavery and the 'gallant leap' of the human spirit. The conclusion provides a resolution that is not a 'happy ending' but a call to 'keep on climbing.'",
      "quotes": [
        "It is a tragedy. Six hundred thousand lives were lost in the Civil War.",
        "That brings us to where we are now. Whatever is going to be done... will have to be done at the local level.",

        "The transition from the 'Malcolm X/MLK' dichotomy to local church funding feels somewhat abrupt.",

        "The connection between Nat Turner and the modern church could be more explicitly woven into the arc."

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest structural element. Proctor 'reframes' (Cilliers) the biblical image of Jacob's Ladder through the lens of the African American experience. He does not treat the text as a static ancient artifact but as a living reality that occurred 'in midair' between the preacher and the slave. The synthesis of the 'stars and stripes' with the 'soldiers of the cross' offers a new frame for understanding American identity. He respects the 'strangeness' of the slave experience while making it an urgent context for modern community building.",
      "quotes": [
        "When does preaching occur? ... It occurs somewhere in midair.",
        "The glue that held the slaves together was their vision of who they were, not in society but in Jesus Christ.",
        "They didn't say 'soldier of the stars and stripes'... They sang 'soldiers of the cross!'"

      "strengths": [
        "Masterful 'reframing' of the Jacob's Ladder spiritual as a theological and social strategy.",
        "Organic connection between the 'then' of slavery and the 'now' of community redemption.",
        "Honors the 'strangeness' of the slave glossolalia as a work of the Holy Spirit."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The biblical text of Genesis 28 itself is largely absent, replaced by the 'text' of the spiritual; more direct engagement with the Jacob narrative could deepen the synthesis.",
        "The transition to capitalist 'money makes money' feels less integrated into the spiritual 'reframing.'",
        "Could further explore the 'ladder' as a bridge between the 'already' and 'not yet' of American democracy."

      "reframing_present": "Yes, it reframes the struggle for civil rights not just as a political movement, but as a spiritual ascent."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is a mix of Ciska Stark's 'open work' and a more prescriptive 'closed' structure. While the historical and spiritual sections are polyvalent and leave room for the mystery of the Spirit ('midair'), the middle section is quite moralistic and directive regarding how churches should spend money. However, the ending returns to an 'open' invitation to 'keep on climbing,' acknowledging the 'chasm of years' and the ongoing nature of the struggle. It does not offer a cheap 'happy ending' but a call to persistent, difficult movement.",
      "quotes": [
        "Every black congregation in America ought to develop a fund for community strengthening.",
        "Does it occur when the preacher speaks or when the listener hears? It occurs somewhere in midair.",
        "Keep on climbing, we gonna make it."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The concept of 'preaching in midair' acknowledges the hearer's active role in meaning-making.",
        "The ending is an invitation to a journey, not a closed conclusion.",
        "Acknowledges the 'ambivalence' of existence (the loathing vs. the admiration of America)."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The middle section is somewhat 'sealed shut' with specific financial prescriptions.",
        "The binary between Malcolm X and MLK is presented as a settled historical fact rather than an open tension for the hearer to navigate.",
        "Could leave more room for the 'resistance' of the hearer who feels overwhelmed by the 'assignment from God.'"
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A 'semi-open' work; spiritually open and polyvalent, but socially and economically prescriptive."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is characterized by a strong narrative arc that moves from the 'dark night' of history to the 'midair' of spiritual encounter. Proctor successfully integrates the 'text' of the spirituals with the 'context' of American racial history, creating a powerful 'reframing' of identity. While the sermon occasionally closes space with specific socio-economic directives, it ultimately functions as an 'open work' by inviting the congregation into a perpetual climb. The dramaturgy is effective, sustaining tension between the pain of the past and the responsibility of the present."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. Proctor avoids the 'pre-chewed emotions' of easy comfort. He takes the 'pain of suffering' seriously by detailing the physical horrors of slavery and the Civil War. There is no 'happy ending' that ignores the 'gnarled hands' or the 'rotted teeth.' The emotion is authentic because it is grounded in historical reality rather than sentimental platitudes. The 'slave glossolalia' is presented not as a cute story, but as a 'grand flight of the human spirit' born of necessity. By refusing to 'romanticize' (as he explicitly states), Proctor maintains aesthetic depth.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential for kitsch exists in the 'I got shoes' spiritual, but Proctor prevents this by grounding it in the 'slave gallery' of a church where secession was signed.",
      "The 'money makes money' section flirts with a simplistic 'prosperity' kitsch but remains tethered to community redemption."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'colored rivulets' of dirt in the children's food trough.",
      "The image of the aging veterans in their 'old blue uniforms' with gnarled hands."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the tension between the 'loathing' and 'admiration' of history to ensure the gospel remains a 'gallant leap' rather than a cheap comfort."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Proctor opens a significant 'space for grace' by defining the sermon as something that happens 'in midair' through the Holy Spirit. He sustains the tension between the 'already' of the ancestors' faith and the 'not yet' of full democratic participation. Grace is not presented as a passive reception but as the 'glue' that allows for 'resistance within accommodation.' However, the space is slightly constricted by the heavy emphasis on 'responsibility' and 'assignment' in the middle section, which leans toward moralization. Nevertheless, the final image of the 'soldiers of the cross' re-centers the sermon on the vertical dimension of grace.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between being 'crushed' and 'not disappearing' is maintained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'mystery of the Holy Spirit at work' in the hearing of the slaves is a central, respected theme.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the historical/spiritual sections; moralization prevails in the institutional sections.",
    "recommendation": "To create more space, the 'local assignment' could be framed more as a response to the 'shoes' already given in Christ, rather than a new law to be fulfilled."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a powerful example of the 'aesthetic turn' in the Black Church tradition, where the beauty of the Word is inseparable from the struggle for justice. Proctor avoids the 'vertical-only' trap of dialectical theology by grounding revelation in the sensory, earthly forms of history and song. The aesthetic quality is found in the 'sober beauty' of his descriptions—the gnarled hands, the old blue uniforms, the rivulets of dirt. He successfully 'reframes' the hearer's reality, moving them from a sense of loss (the closing of Bishop College) to a sense of heritage and agency. The sermon functions as an 'open work' primarily through its pneumatology: the idea that the Spirit translates the word in 'midair.' While the middle section's shift to institutional pragmatism is aesthetically flatter and more prescriptive, the bookending of the sermon with vivid historical imagery and the rhythmic power of the spirituals ensures a high aesthetic impact. It is a work of 'stewardship of language' that honors the ancestors while challenging the living.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Vivid, sensory imagery that avoids historical and religious kitsch.",
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the Jacob's Ladder metaphor through the slave experience.",
      "Strong oral rhythm and musicality that honors the homiletic tradition."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The middle section on church finances is aesthetically 'dry' and overly prescriptive.",
      "Direct engagement with the biblical text of Genesis could deepen the 'reframing.'",
      "Transitions between historical narrative and modern application could be more fluid."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Dramatic with a focus on 'Homiletic Remembrance.'",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Four Pages).",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who value historical continuity, social justice, and a faith that is grounded in the 'real world' of struggle and institutional building.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Use the 'show, don't tell' principle even for the modern examples of church success.",
      "Explore the 'ambivalence' of the biblical characters (like Jacob) to mirror the 'ambivalence' of American history.",
      "Ensure the 'moral assignment' flows more clearly from the 'spiritual gift' to maintain the space for grace."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Samuel DeWitt Proctor’s 'Climbing Jacob’s Ladder' is an aesthetically robust sermon that demonstrates how form and content are inextricably linked. By using the 'poetics of memory,' Proctor creates a space where the holy happens in the 'midair' between a painful past and a responsible future. The sermon avoids the 'kitsch' of easy answers, instead offering the 'sober beauty' of a faith that climbs despite gnarled hands. It is a significant example of how homiletic aesthetics can serve the dual purpose of consolation and prophetic challenge."
