    "risk_explanation": "The only risk is a potential shift to Critical Parent when discussing those who 'reject the foundation stones,' but this is kept at a philosophical level."

    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a model of psychologically healthy homiletics. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, inviting the listener into a state of autonomy and responsibility. It avoids the common 'Bait and Switch' of religious rhetoric by maintaining a consistent definition of freedom that includes the 'hazard' of choice. It empowers the listener by affirming their mental and moral 'equipment' rather than fostering dependency on the preacher or the institution.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong appeal to Adult reasoning and historical context.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The high-level intellectual framing (Tillich, Shakespeare) might exclude those who do not share that specific Adult vocabulary.",
      "The 'imperious orders' language at the end flirts briefly with a Critical Parent tone."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to frame responsibility as a natural consequence of freedom rather than a debt to be paid. Maintain the Adult-Adult transparency that respects the listener's capacity to 'sift alternate possibilities.'"
