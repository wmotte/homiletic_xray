    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The factual content is primarily historical and civic rather than exegetical. The preacher uses the Lucan text (The Great Commandment) as a springboard for a 'civil religion' discourse. While the exegesis of the 'triangle' of love (God-Neighbor-Self) is theologically sound, the 'Sache' (the living Christ) is largely replaced by the 'American Proposition'. The dogmatic depth is sacrificed for a narrative of national destiny. The factual ear receives more information about the Declaration of Independence and the Preamble than about the specific context of the Good Samaritan parable, which is mentioned but not unpacked. The theological 'Sache' remains a backdrop for a political 'Sache'.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is the American proposition in history.",
        "The questioner goes back into the long, bright engagement of Israel with divine truth, to the sixth chapter of the Book of Deuteronomy.",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as a bridge-builder between the 'dark night of slavery' and the 'high privilege' of the present. There is a conscious 'Selbstdarstellung' of the wise elder who remembers the 'echo sound of hounds'. However, a genuine 'Selbstenthüllung' occurs in his admission of the difficulty of self-love ('We do not know how to love ourselves'). He positions himself as a patriot who is not an idolater, revealing a tension between his love for the nation and his theological commitment to God's sovereignty. The 'I' is largely diaconal, serving the purpose of national reconciliation.",
      "quotes": [
        "I grew up in the Louisiana swamp country...",
        "I would not want to claim for one moment on this fateful day that the nation is divine. That is an idolatry.",
        "I know who they were, but I don't know what they were. Three-fifths!"

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive/Hysterical hybrid. He seeks harmony and closeness (Depressive) through a grand, stage-oriented rhetorical performance (Hysterical).",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined by 'Solidarity'. The preacher uses 'we' and 'us' extensively, positioning himself as a fellow traveler in the 'American experiment'. There is a subtle 'Teaching' authority when he corrects the 'original intent' of the founders. The relationship noise is low, though the 'ecumenical' jokes at the beginning might slightly alienate those who prefer a more somber liturgical tone. He speaks 'at eye level' with the new administration while maintaining the 'prophetic distance' required to warn against idolatry. The 'You-message' is one of collective responsibility.",
      "quotes": [
        "Do you sense, as I do quite often, that this nation represents something new...?",
        "I say to you solemnly today...",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The appeal is heavily weighted toward 'Anspruch' (Demand/Law) disguised as 'Zuspruch' (Promise). The 'This do, and thou shalt live' is presented as a roadmap for national survival. While the preacher mentions 'creatureliness' and 'God's purpose', the weight falls on the American people to 'contract a society of mutuality'. The theological 'Zuspruch' (the gift of grace) is secondary to the civic 'Anspruch' (the duty of justice). The risk of moralism is high, as the 'bright tomorrow' is contingent on the 'doing' of the commandment. It is a 'Law-heavy' sermon in a 'Gospel-sounding' key.",
      "quotes": [
        "This do, and thou shalt live.",
        "We are here to establish before the world...",

  "congruence_and_disruptions": {
    "congruence_judgment": "The sermon is highly congruent in its rhetorical 'package'. The preacher's voice, history, and the occasion align perfectly. However, there is a theological incongruence between the 'creatureliness' mentioned and the 'divinely appointed' exceptionalism of the nation.",
    "dominant_side": "Red (Appeal/Civic Duty)",
    "disruptions": "The transition from the 'swamp country' memories to the 'ecumenical' jokes creates a slight tonal disruption (noise).",
    "healing_disruption": "The warning against 'idolatry' and the mention of the 'sleeping serpent' of slavery serve as healing disruptions, preventing the sermon from becoming pure political sycophancy."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6,
    "summary": "This sermon is a masterclass in 'Civil Homiletics'. It navigates the complex waters of a national inaugural service with rhetorical grace and historical weight. However, from a strict Schulz von Thun and Barthian perspective, it suffers from a 'Red-side' dominance where the Gospel (Zuspruch) is largely instrumentalized for the sake of the American Proposition (Anspruch). The 'Sache' is not so much the Christ of the Scriptures as it is the 'Idea of America' baptized in Lucan language. The preacher's Riemann type (Depressive-Hysterical) allows him to seek the harmony the occasion demands while utilizing a grand oratorical style. The 'Yellow' side is strong in creating a sense of national 'we', but the 'Blue' side lacks deep exegetical rigor, choosing instead to use the Bible as a mirror for the Constitution. The Barthian warning is critical here: God is at risk of becoming a 'predicate' of the American project rather than the 'Acting Subject' who stands in judgment over all nations. While communicatively powerful and emotionally resonant, it leans heavily on the 'Appeal Ear' of the congregation, demanding a civic righteousness that risks sliding into moralism.",
    "barthian_warning": "High psychologization of the 'American dream'. God is used to validate the 'American proposition' rather than being the Word that breaks into human history.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Masterful use of narrative and collective memory.",
      "Strong rhetorical congruence and pacing.",
      "Courageous naming of the 'sleeping serpent' of slavery."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Shift the focus from 'American purpose' to 'God's sovereignty'.",
      "Balance the civic demand with the theological promise of grace.",
      "Reduce the 'Hysterical' rhetorical flourishes in favor of 'Blue' exegetical depth."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A rhetorically brilliant, though theologically horizontal, sermon that serves the state more than the pulpit's primary 'Sache'."
