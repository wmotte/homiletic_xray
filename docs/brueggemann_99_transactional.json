    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely avoids manipulative 'games.' It identifies a common 'Adapted Child' state in the congregation (anxiety/nervousness) and uses a Nurturing Parent voice to provide a sense of security. By reframing chaos as 'God's rubber ducky,' it invites the 'Free Child' into a state of play and wonder. The transition to ethical responsibility at the end is framed as an 'emancipation' rather than a 'burden,' which supports the listener's autonomy.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective use of humor to lower psychological defenses.",
      "Strong emphasis on safety and reliability over fear and judgment.",
      "Addresses real-world anxieties (cancer, terrorism) without falling into 'Ain't It Awful'."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The sudden shift to 'sinners be consumed' in Section V is a brief Critical Parent intrusion that could feel like a 'Bait and Switch' if not carefully delivered.",
      "The 'iron lung' metaphor, while descriptive, could inadvertently trigger 'Victim' feelings of total helplessness/passivity."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To maintain this high level of health, ensure the final call to 'public policy' and 'justice' remains an invitation from the Adult ego (logical consequence of gratitude) rather than a demand from the Critical Parent (shaming for not doing enough)."
