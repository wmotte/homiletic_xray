    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon follows the narrative of Acts 16 closely. However, it treats the text as a representative 'map' of social dynamics rather than seeking what is unique to this specific passage. The focus on 'money men' and 'magistrates' is a thematic reading that could be applied to many biblical confrontations with power.",
      "quotes": [
        "It strikes me that these five ingredients in the story... provide a map for a very fearful society."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The exegesis is thin. There is no mention of the Greek nuances, the specific Roman colonial context of Philippi, or the theological significance of the 'spirit of Python' (fortune-telling). The preacher immediately jumps to modern analogies (talk shows, Supreme Court) without establishing the historical-theological distance first.",
      "quotes": [
        "They are perhaps 'activist judges' like our Supreme Court.",
        "You can imagine her as a sensation making the rounds of the talk shows."

      "improvement_point": "Utilize the original languages and historical context of Philippi to explain why the 'customs' were specifically 'not lawful for Romans' before making modern parallels."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is highly concrete and contemporary, as Dekker demands. It addresses the 'zeitgeist' of fear, economic exploitation, and political polarization. However, it risks becoming a sociological lecture rather than a spiritual application of the Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "His life is no longer shaped or intimidated by the tea party crowd of the right or of the left who unwittingly serve the money men.",
        "The magistrates want to keep us on Orange Alert."

      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application remains rooted in the 'new, current, proclamatory word' of God rather than just a critique of modern media and politics."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a 'story-then-meaning' structure. While the contemporary analogies are peppered throughout, the movement is largely: here is the biblical scene, and here is what it looks like today. The hearer is an observer of the text's relevance rather than being 'expounded' by the text itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "The story contains all of the ingredients of a society that is frightened...",
        "So imagine the jailer. The action now focuses on him."

      "improvement_point": "Integrate the 'now' into the 'then' more fluidly so that the revelation of the text and the revelation of the hearer's heart happen simultaneously."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'misery' (fear, greed, abuse) is well-articulated. 'Redemption' is present in the 'Easter news' and the 'Lord Jesus.' 'Gratitude' is seen in the jailer's hospitality. However, the 'misery' is framed more as a social condition than a theological state before God.",
      "quotes": [
        "He had seen with his own eyes that the people around Jesus acted differently...",
        "The story ends in hospitality. He feeds them; he cares for their wounds."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon presents an 'alternative way to live,' which aligns with the two ways. However, the 'seriousness of being lost' is framed almost entirely as 'being lost in time' (social/temporal loss). The eternal dimension and the gravity of God's judgment are absent.",
      "quotes": [
        "He need no longer be a participant in the old world of death.",
        "It holds before us another way that is not defined by the foolishness of the world."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the 'telos' and the 'Lord' to be believed in. The sermon correctly identifies that salvation is 'outside himself' in the person of Jesus. However, Christ often feels like a catalyst for a 'new lifestyle' rather than the ontological Savior who is God.",
      "quotes": [
        "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved...",
        "Jesus has been raised in power, that Jesus is loose in the world."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1150 words, the sermon would take about 11-12 minutes to deliver. According to Dekker's Thesis 8, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for 'depth.'",
      "quotes": [
        "n/a"
      ],

    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short primarily in its brevity and its lack of deep exegetical grounding. It functions more as a social-psychological commentary on the Book of Acts than a rigorous 'exposition and application' of the Word. While it identifies the 'misery' of the zeitgeist effectively, it lacks the 'breadth' Miskotte and Dekker demand for true depth. The theological weight of the 'two ways' is diminished by a focus on temporal/social loss over eternal reality.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application that engages with the contemporary zeitgeist and cultural philosophy.",
      "Clear identification of the 'misery' (fear/greed) within the human subject.",
      "Maintains Christ as the necessary telos for salvation."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (approx. 11 minutes) failing the 'depth needs breadth' criterion.",
      "Lack of original language engagement and historical-theological distance (Thesis 2).",
      "Over-reliance on modern political/social analogies which risks dating the sermon and obscuring the 'nowhere else' quality of the text."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an inadequate sermon according to Dekker's criteria. It is too short, lacks exegetical rigor, and prioritizes social-political mapping over the specific, unique revelation of the Bible passage. It functions as an 'address' on social crisis rather than a 'recreation of the Bible into a new, current, proclamatory word.'"
