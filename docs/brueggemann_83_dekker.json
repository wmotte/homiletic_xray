  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on one specific Bible passage. It jumps between Romans 4, Genesis 17, Psalm 22, and Mark 8. It treats the Bible as a collection of themes (future, trust) rather than recreating a specific text into a new word. It lacks the 'point that can be found nowhere else'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Paul writes this lyrical chapter, Romans 4...",
        "You remember Abraham from our reading in Genesis...",
        "The Psalm we read begins...",
        "just as Jesus promised his disciples in our gospel reading."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one pericope (e.g., Romans 4:13-25) and exhaust its specific logic rather than using it as a springboard for a general theology of 'future'."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is a basic understanding of the historical context (Abraham's barrenness, the church in Rome's divisions), but it remains at a surface level. The preacher uses the text to support a pre-conceived theme rather than letting the exegesis drive the sermon.",
      "quotes": [
        "In that ancient patriarchal world, life was a total dead end.",
        "The Jewish Christians liked to think about how they had kept all the requirements of Torah; the Gentile members... liked to brag about their freedom."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the linguistic and theological particularity of the text. Avoid summarizing the story; instead, expose the internal tension of the Greek/Hebrew thought-world."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is contemporary but tends toward the general. The mention of Reagan and the 'capitalist system' provides some cultural philosophy, but the 'verification' list becomes a series of general ethical categories.",
      "quotes": [
        "The verification is in a church that pays attention to those disqualified by the capitalist system.",
        "The verification is in the telling of hard truth about the world, and that in a culture of denial."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the application more specific to the 'spiritual life and the congregation' mentioned by Dekker. Move from 'the capitalist system' to the specific 'misery' of the hearer in the pew."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a thematic structure where exposition and application are somewhat mixed, but they often feel like parallel tracks. The 'Reagan' hook is an external frame imposed on the text rather than the text 'expounding' the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "That combination worked for him, and maybe for us in our Lenten journey of faith.",
        "Paul takes up this old memory and transposes it into the church’s future."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Allow the text's own categories to provide the application, rather than using a political anecdote as the primary hermeneutical lens."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The three parts are present in the background. Misery is identified as being 'as good as dead' or 'lost in a failed past'. Redemption is the 'gift of God'. Gratitude is the 'verification' through works. However, it leans heavily on 'future' as a psychological category.",
      "quotes": [
        "no one is really qualified because of their past, because all have sinned and fallen short.",
        "It all rests on grace, the inexplicable gift of God’s grace."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Sharpen the 'misery' aspect. The sermon treats it more as a 'cul-de-sac' than as a theological state of being lost before God."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are largely absent. While it mentions being 'defined by a failed past', there is little sense of the 'ultimate possibilities' or the danger of being lost. The tone is overly optimistic and 'lyrical'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Lent is for embracing... the offer of a new world made by God from nothing.",
        "We are on our way rejoicing ... into God’s future."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the 'seriousness of the journey'. Address the possibility of 'being lost in time' if the call to trust is rejected."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the one who overcomes death, but He often feels like an illustration of the 'future' theme rather than the telos. The doctrine of the two natures is not explicitly felt.",
      "quotes": [
        "It turns on the resurrection of Jesus...",
        "God... refuses to let Jesus be negated by the power of the empire."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1450 words, the sermon likely lasts 14-15 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for 'depth'.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Increase the substantive exploration of the text to reach at least 20 minutes, allowing the 'dogma and exegesis to sleep' more deeply."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily due to its lack of focus on a single Bible passage and its insufficient length. It functions more as a thematic reflection on 'the future' using various scriptures as support, rather than an exposition of a specific Word of God. The political framing (Reagan) threatens to overshadow the biblical content.",
    "strengths": [
      "Adequate use of the three parts (misery, redemption, gratitude) as a background framework.",
      "Strong emphasis on grace as an 'inexplicable gift' that shatters human categories."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of a single, specific pericope; the sermon is too broad.",
      "Insufficient duration (under 20 minutes) to achieve necessary homiletical depth.",
      "Absence of the 'two ways' and the seriousness of being lost."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the strict sense of Dekker's definition. It is a thematic speech about 'God's future' rather than a specific 'recreation of a Bible passage into a new, current, proclamatory word'."
