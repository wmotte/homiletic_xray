  "aristotelian_modes_analysis": {
    "logos": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The rational architecture is functional but loose. The preacher uses a 'key' metaphor to frame the sermon, transitioning from the biblical narrative of Peter's restoration to the broader theme of love as a universal solution. While the exegetical move regarding 'more than these' (interpreting 'these' as fishing gear rather than other disciples) is logically argued based on character consistency, the sermon frequently deviates into secondary themes like the social gospel and Mother's Day tributes. The logical thread is often interrupted by anecdotal asides, making the 'thread' more thematic than argumentative. The conclusion shifts from the logical 'how' to a relational 'who', which serves a rhetorical purpose but weakens the deductive structure.",
      "quotes": [
        "I think what our Lord was really saying was, 'Simon, do you love me more than all of this fishing gear...'",
        "And where something occurred... that does not fit a personality... I think we have to take our stand on the side of what the person ordinarily or usually would do.",
        "The social gospelists may have been wrong in many things, but we were right in believing that people's bodies have to be seen about."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of a central metaphor (the jar of keys) to provide a conceptual hook.",
        "Logical defense of a specific exegetical interpretation regarding the 'fishing gear'.",
        "Clear causal link established between the love of Christ and the capacity to serve ('Feed my sheep')."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Tighten the transitions between the exegesis of John 21 and the Mother's Day applications to avoid a fragmented feel.",
        "Reduce the number of 'asides' (e.g., the section on how people report gossip) that distract from the primary argument.",
        "Provide a more robust logical bridge between the 'social gospel' section and the 'restoration of Peter' section."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The Logos is sufficient for a narrative sermon but lacks the rigorous structural discipline required for a truly persuasive argument."
    },
    "pathos": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Pathos is the strongest element of this sermon. The preacher masterfully employs sensory details—the smell of the sea, the growling of a stomach, the chill of the night—to make the biblical scene and the modern application palpable. The emotional resonance peaks during the personal narrative of the 1931 funeral and the subsequent struggle during the Depression. By connecting Peter's shame with the universal experience of failure and a mother's unconditional love, the preacher creates a powerful affective bridge. The sermon moves beyond information to a shared emotional experience of desperation and hope.",
      "quotes": [
        "All of this fishing gear... the smell of the sea and the odor of fresh-caught fish; the business that you used to be in...",
        "There's no use talking to people about the bread of life when their stomachs are growling.",
        "I stood at her grave in the Evergreen Cemetery yesterday afternoon, and I said to her dust, 'Thank you, Mother.'"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Highly effective use of 'slices of life' that are immediately recognizable to the congregation.",
        "Strong sensory imagery that prevents the theology from remaining abstract.",
        "Authentic emotional arc that moves from the 'lock' of fear to the 'key' of love."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition to the Mother's Day theme feels slightly forced in the middle section; it could be more organically integrated.",
        "Ensure that the emotional weight of the personal story does not completely eclipse the biblical text's own emotional gravity.",
        "Avoid over-relying on the 'Mother's Day' sentimentality to carry the theological weight of the sermon."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Excellent emotional resonance achieved through vivid storytelling and sensory detail, successfully making the gospel 'felt'.",
      "emotional_tone": "Compassionate, nostalgic, and ultimately triumphant."
    },
    "ethos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher establishes strong Ethos through vulnerability and the role of a 'witness'. By sharing the story of his father's death and his own childhood fears, he steps out from behind the pulpit to stand with the congregation. He speaks not as a distant academic but as one who has 'been in the storm so long'. However, the Ethos is slightly diminished by a few moralizing asides regarding how people leave the church, which can come across as slightly scolding. Nevertheless, the overall impression is one of a credible, seasoned witness whose life has been tested by the message he proclaims.",
      "quotes": [
        "I was a boy not yet thirteen... My world collapsed.",
        "I don't know how I've come through, but I know who; yes, I do.",
        "I came home tired and a little disgusted from the courts where I had been wrestling, talking to the judge about a lad."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "High degree of personal vulnerability regarding family history and childhood loss.",
        "The preacher presents himself as a fellow-traveler rather than a moral superior.",
        "Authority is derived from lived experience and submission to the text rather than titles."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Soften the 'scolding' tone when discussing reasons people stop attending church to maintain the 'witness' persona.",
        "The use of 'I think' and 'it seems to me' is good for humility, but could be balanced with more 'Thus saith the Lord' moments to ground the authority in Scripture.",
        "Ensure the personal anecdotes always point back to Christ rather than the preacher's own resilience."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Strong credibility built on authentic vulnerability and a long history of faith, though occasionally bordering on the anecdotal.",
      "authenticity": "High; the preacher uses personal struggle to validate the theological claims."

  "rhetorical_balance_analysis": {
    "dominant_mode": "Pathos",
    "suppressed_mode": "Logos",
    "balance_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward Pathos and Ethos, creating a deeply moving experience that relies on the preacher's personal history and emotional storytelling. Logos serves as a secondary framework—a 'jar' to hold the emotional content—but it is not the driving force. The transition from the exegesis of Peter to the tribute to mothers and then to the preacher's own mother creates a thematic flow that is emotionally satisfying but logically 'jumpy'. The three modes reinforce each other in the final third of the sermon, where the 'Who' (Ethos/Pathos) replaces the 'How' (Logos).",
    "consequences_of_imbalance": [
      "Hearers seeking a rigorous, verse-by-verse exposition may find the sermon intellectually thin.",
      "The emotional intensity may overwhelm the specific biblical instructions of the text (feeding the sheep).",
      "There is a risk that the congregation remembers the preacher's mother more than the specific theological implications of Peter's restoration."
    ],
    "recommendation_for_balance": "Strengthen the Logos by more clearly defining the 'Feed my sheep' command in the modern context, providing a more structured 'how-to' for the congregation to follow the 'who'."

    "orthodoxy_logos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is scripturally grounded, though the exegesis is more intuitive than technical. It remains within the bounds of orthodox Christian teaching regarding restoration and grace."
    },
    "orthopathy_pathos": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in awakening right affections: trust in God during storms, love for the neighbor, and a sense of gratitude for grace."
    },
    "orthopraxy_ethos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher models the life of a witness who has applied the 'key' of love to his own grief and professional life."
    }
  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_rhetorical_score": 6.7,
    "summary": "This is a strong, emotionally resonant sermon that excels in the 'New Homiletic' style, prioritizing the hearer's experience of the message over a cold, deductive argument. The preacher uses the dialogue between Jesus and Peter as a springboard into a broader meditation on love as the 'key' to life's mysteries. While the logical structure is somewhat loose and the sermon occasionally wanders into various sub-themes (social gospel, church attendance, Mother's Day), it is anchored by a powerful personal testimony that validates the preacher's Ethos. The use of sensory language and narrative tension makes the sermon highly engaging. However, the Logos is the weakest link; the connection between the biblical text and the various illustrations is sometimes more associative than logical. The sermon functions best as a pastoral 'word of comfort' rather than a rigorous teaching moment.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful use of personal narrative to illustrate theological truths.",
      "Vivid sensory imagery that brings the biblical and historical scenes to life.",
      "Strong Ethos established through vulnerability and a 'witness' perspective."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Tighten the logical transitions between the exegesis and the multiple anecdotal applications.",
      "Ground the 'Mother's Day' application more firmly in the specific 'Feed my sheep' command.",
      "Reduce distracting asides to maintain a clearer 'thread' throughout the sermon."
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Emotional-Narrative",
    "audience_analysis": "Most effective for a general congregation seeking comfort, encouragement, and a personal connection to the gospel; less effective for those seeking systematic theological instruction.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Develop a more disciplined three-point structure to support the narrative flow.",
      "Spend more time on the 'Feed my sheep' application to balance the 'Lovest thou me' focus.",
      "Limit personal anecdotes to one primary story to avoid overshadowing the biblical text."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a highly effective piece of pastoral rhetoric that prioritizes Pathos and Ethos to achieve its goal of restoration and comfort. While it lacks the rigorous Logos of a traditional expository sermon, its ability to connect the 'then and there' of Peter with the 'here and now' of the hearer—specifically through the lens of maternal love and personal loss—makes it a compelling and credible proclamation of the gospel."
