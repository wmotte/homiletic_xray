    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' By operating primarily from the Adult ego state, the preacher respects the listener's autonomy and intelligence. The sermon addresses deep trauma (Sandy Hook) without using it as a 'gimmick' to induce guilt or forced conversion. Instead, it models a healthy way to process the 'silence of God' through the lens of history, literature, and scripture, ultimately promoting a faith that is integrated rather than adapted.",
    "strengths": [
      "High Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "Validation of the 'Child's' fear and questioning without judgment.",
      "Refusal to use 'cheap grace' or simplistic Rescuer logic."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Slightly Critical Parent tone regarding the biblical literacy of modern students.",
      "Heavy reliance on academic/intellectual 'Adult' processing may leave those in the 'Child' state of acute crisis feeling a bit distant."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name the 'unanswerable' as unanswerable. This prevents the 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' game and keeps the communication transparent and authentic."
