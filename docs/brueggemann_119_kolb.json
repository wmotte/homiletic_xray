    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience primarily through the lens of the wedding ritual itself and the immediate relational context of the couple. It grounds the abstract command of 'love' in the physical presence of the 'supreme neighbor' (the spouse). However, it lacks a specific, vivid narrative or 'slice of life' story that would allow the hearer to feel the weight of the experience beyond the immediate liturgical setting. The identification with the 'neighbor' is conceptualized quickly rather than felt through a detailed story.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This phase is well-developed through the preacher's analysis of the human condition and the 'threats' to marriage. The sermon pauses to look at the 'why' behind marital struggle, identifying 'therapeutic, consumer society' and 'romantic utopianism' as problematic perspectives. It offers a cultural critique that helps the hearer observe their own situation from a different angle, moving from the 'I' to the 'we' and the 'neighborhood'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The great threat to marriage in a therapeutic, consumer society... is that one imagines one has only this one neighbor",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The theological exposition is logical and structured around the 'three neighbors' framework (Supreme, Needy, Holy). The exegesis of the Great Commandment is solid, particularly the insight that Jesus 'did not pause for a comma.' The sermon formulates a clear 'big idea': marriage is a neighborly practice that requires the 'Holy Neighbor' to sustain the human ones. It connects dogmatic truths about forgiveness and generosity to the structure of the relationship.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the sermon calls for 'generosity and forgiveness,' these remain somewhat abstract virtues rather than concrete action steps. The call to look toward the 'poor, the needy, the powerless' is a significant ethical challenge, but the sermon does not provide a 'how-to' or a specific starting point for a newly married couple to implement this in their 'neighborhood.' It invites change but lacks a specific implementation plan.",
      "quotes": [

It falls short in providing concrete, actionable steps for the couple and the congregation, remaining largely in the realm of 'Reflective Observation' and 'Abstract Conceptualization.' The preacher effectively uses the 'neighborhood' metaphor to challenge the 'romantic utopianism' of modern marriage, but the transition to 'Active Experimentation' is vague, relying on general virtues like 'generosity' and 'forgiveness' without specific examples of their implementation. The sermon is highly suited for 'Assimilating' learners who value intellectual clarity and theological frameworks, but it may leave 'Accommodating' learners—those who learn by doing—without a clear path forward. The theological move to the 'Holy Neighbor' is a strong normative climax, but it functions more as a logical necessity than a practical guide.",

      "Use more sensory language to ground abstract theological concepts in physical reality."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong example of a 'Declarative' wedding address that prioritizes theological depth over sentimentalism. From a Kolb perspective, it excels in the 'Thinking' and 'Watching' quadrants, providing the congregation with a robust theological framework for understanding marriage as a public, neighborly act. However, its diagnostic score is limited by a lack of 'Active Experimentation.' The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'Holy Neighbor' as a theological concept and the 'Holy Neighbor' as a practical resource for daily marital life. It is a well-crafted 'Assimilating' sermon that would benefit from more 'Accommodating' elements to achieve a truly holistic learning cycle."
