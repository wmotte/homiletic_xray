    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily as a tool for translation rather than immersive experience. While it successfully modernizes the biblical 'manager' by suggesting he might run a 'plant' or 'hospital', it often stops at the conceptual level. The imagery of the 'tight-fisted owner' and 'cooking the books' provides a clear mental frame, but the sensory depth is limited. It lacks the 'stench' or 'sweat' that Wilson advocates for. However, the inclusion of the 'balm in Gilead' and the graphic imagery from Psalm 79 (birds of the air feeding on bodies) provides a necessary visceral counterpoint to the more abstract economic discussion. The imagery serves the 'reframing' of the parable well, moving from ancient agriculture to modern 'commodity thinking,' but it remains more illustrative than evocative.",
      "quotes": [
        "He hears rumors that the manager is cooking the books.",

        "Avoid over-relying on corporate jargon (bottom line, organizational charts) even when deconstructing it."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "The sermon leans toward 'telling'. It explains the mechanics of the parable and the theology of the 'bottom line' rather than showing the emotional weight of debt or the relief of its cancellation."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise and intellectually rigorous. The preacher exhibits 'stewardship of language' by carefully defining terms like 'fiduciary responsibility' and 'quid pro quo' within a theological horizon. There is a deliberate avoidance of 'Canaanite' religious jargon; instead, the preacher uses the language of the 'market' to subvert it. The distinction between 'children of light' (as rule-followers) and 'children of this age' (as imaginative actors) is handled with nuance. However, the repetition of 'bottom line' and 'commodity' becomes slightly monotonous, bordering on a different kind of ideological jargon. The precision in naming 'white male privilege' and 'old industrialism' shows a commitment to truth-telling in the contemporary context.",
      "quotes": [
        "Fiduciary responsibility means to use capital (mammon) to make friends.",
        "The tight rules of bottom line commodity thinking.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "Reduce the frequency of the phrase 'bottom line' to maintain its rhetorical impact.",
        "Introduce more varied vocabulary for 'generosity' to avoid it becoming a conceptual cliché.",
        "Ensure the transition between the 'Presbyterian' identity and the radical gospel call is less repetitive."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Religious jargon is almost entirely absent. Instead, the sermon uses economic jargon (mammon, capital, commodity) as the primary material for theological reflection."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a rhythmic, almost litany-like quality in Section IV ('When it is gone...'). This use of parallelism and repetition creates a cadence suitable for oral delivery. However, much of the earlier sections (I-III) are structured as a commentary, which feels more like 'paper language'—informative and logical but lacking in poetic flow. The sentence structure is generally short and declarative, which aids clarity but limits the 'legato' moments of reflection. The rhetorical questions in the latter half provide a necessary pulse that prevents the sermon from becoming a lecture. It is a functional, sober rhythm rather than a lyrical one.",
      "quotes": [
        "When investment fails; When the banks fail; When the market slips...",
        "Not God and mammon, not good news and conventional management.",
        "Real people who have real debts and real needs and are capable of real gratitude."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of anaphora (repetition at the start of sentences) in the 'When it is gone' section.",
        "Short, punchy sentences that are easy for a congregation to follow.",
        "Good use of contrast in sentence structure to highlight the 'two worlds'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Break up the explanatory prose with more varied sentence lengths.",
        "Incorporate more alliteration or assonance to make key phrases more memorable.",
        "Avoid the 'First... Second...' structural markers which make the sermon sound like a classroom outline."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Primarily oral, but with a strong 'outline' structure that betrays a written, logical foundation."
    },
    "average_score_language": 6.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic. It prioritizes intellectual precision and the 'stewardship of words' over poetic flourish. While it lacks high-sensory imagery, it excels at 'reframing' contemporary economic reality through the biblical text. The rhythm is most effective when it moves into prophetic lament, using repetition to build tension. It avoids religious kitsch by using the hard, cold language of the market to describe the 'commodity world,' making the eventual call to grace feel earned rather than sentimental."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The structure is largely didactic and follows a Roman-numeral outline (I-VI), which inhibits a true 'narrative arc' or 'Lowry loop'. While it begins with the tension of being 'caught in the middle,' the progression is more of a thematic expansion than a dramatic journey. The 'turning point' is intellectual—the realization that the owner commends the manager—rather than an experiential shift for the hearer. The energy remains relatively flat because the sermon explains the plot of the parable rather than inhabiting it. The conclusion returns to the opening theme but feels more like a summary than a resolution of a sustained dramatic tension.",
      "quotes": [
        "At the outset the owner is tight-fisted...",
        "Beyond the gratitude of the debtors, his dishonest action evokes two responses...",
        "So here is the news from this story."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear logical progression that is easy to follow.",
        "The 'When it is gone' section provides a momentary peak in tension.",
        "Consistent focus on the central metaphor of being 'in the middle'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Remove explicit numbering (I, II, III) to allow the 'plot' to flow more organically.",
        "Start with the contemporary 'crisis' (when it is gone) to create immediate stakes.",
        "Create a more dramatic 'climax' where the hearer feels the weight of the choice between God and Mammon."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "Static structure. It functions as an exegetical commentary with contemporary applications rather than a dynamic narrative journey."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. It performs a masterclass in Cilliers' 'reframing'. The biblical text is not smoothed over; its 'strangeness' (the commendation of dishonesty) is highlighted and used to challenge the hearer's 'Presbyterian' (rule-following) context. The synthesis of the manager's shrewdness with the failure of modern industrialism and military power is surprising and provocative. It respects the 'then' of the text while making the 'now' feel urgent. The transition from 'homes of debtors' to 'eternal homes' is an organic theological move that bridges the material and the spiritual without being forced.",
      "quotes": [
        "In a word, they are good Presbyterians. They hold to the bottom line without compromise.",
        "When the incomparable power of the US military is gone . . . what then?",
        "Jesus shifts from the homes of grateful debtors to being at home with God in eternity."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of the 'children of light' as rigid rule-followers.",
        "Courageous integration of political and economic realities (white privilege, market failure).",
        "The text is allowed to speak its own 'weird' truth against the context."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Could further explore the 'shrewdness' in a contemporary personal example to make it less systemic and more individual.",
        "Ensure the 'Episcopal friend' anecdote doesn't distract from the broader contextual critique.",
        "Deepen the connection to the Jeremiah/Psalm texts; they feel slightly like 'pasted on' proof-texts."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strongly present. It reframes 'faithfulness' from 'following rules' to 'shrewd generosity'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon maintains a degree of openness by acknowledging the 'hard, radical teaching' and stating 'I will not try to make this easy for us.' It avoids the 'happy ending' kitsch by pointing toward a future where things are 'gone'. However, the conclusion, while inviting ('We might too!'), is somewhat prescriptive in its binary choice between God and Mammon. It functions as an 'open work' in that it leaves the hearer with the discomfort of their own 'commodity thinking,' but the theological categories are quite firmly set. It respects the hearer as a 'mature conversation partner' by not offering easy steps but a difficult alternative.",
      "quotes": [
        "I will not try to make this easy for us. It is a hard, radical teaching.",
        "We may imagine that he is... welcomed by his friends.",
        "The manager in the story decided for the alternative. We might too!"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Refusal to resolve the tension of the 'dishonest' manager too quickly.",
        "Acknowledge the difficulty of the teaching for the specific audience (Presbyterians).",
        "Ends with an invitation/possibility rather than a command."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Leave more room for the 'how'—how does one practically 'cook the books' for grace in a modern job?",
        "Allow for more ambivalence regarding the 'owner'—is he God, or just a character?",
        "The binary 'God vs Mammon' could be opened up to explore the messy middle where most hearers live."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Relatively open. It invites the hearer into a new way of seeing (perception) rather than just a new way of doing (moralism)."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is intellectually robust but dramaturgically conservative. It relies on a classic homiletical outline that prioritizes clarity over narrative tension. Its aesthetic success lies in 'Integration'—the seamless way it weaves the ancient parable into a critique of modern capitalism. It avoids the 'closed' nature of many sermons by refusing to simplify the difficult text, though its formal structure (I-VI) feels somewhat 'sealed'. It creates a space for the hearer to reconsider their identity, moving from a 'child of light' to a 'shrewd' participant in grace."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'pre-chewed' emotions and 'happy endings'. By focusing on the 'hard, radical' nature of the text and naming the impending loss of power and privilege, it bypasses the 'sentimentality' often found in sermons on grace. The comfort offered is not 'cheap'; it is a 'fallback resource' for when the world fails. The preacher's admission of being 'like you, something of a Presbyterian' grounds the sermon in authentic struggle rather than pastoral pretense.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None identified. The sermon actively deconstructs the 'happy ending' of the 'children of light'."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The naming of 'white male privilege' as something that will be 'gone'.",
      "The admission that the teaching is 'hard' and 'radical' and not easily resolved."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of 'un-comfortability'. To increase depth, the preacher could lean further into the 'lament' of the Jeremiah text to provide a more emotional (rather than just intellectual) counterweight to the economic analysis."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by redefining it as 'shrewdness' and 'outside the box' thinking. By attacking 'bottom-line reasoning,' the sermon clears away the 'commodity thinking' that blocks the Holy. However, the space is somewhat narrowed by the strong socio-political framing; grace here is very much 'neighborly relationship.' While this is biblical, the 'mystical' or 'unavailable' dimension of grace (the 'vertical' dimension) is less prominent than the 'horizontal' ethical dimension. The 'eternal home' is mentioned but remains a shadow of the 'earthly home'.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'dishonesty' and 'commendation' is sustained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'strangeness' of Jesus' teaching is respected, though the 'mystery' of God is largely translated into 'neighborly fidelity'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails as a 'gift' of relationship, though it is presented as a 'choice' we must make, which edges toward moralization.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'eternal home' to be more than a 'shift in register'. Explore the 'Space for Grace' as a space where God acts beyond our 'shrewdness'."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high-quality example of 'Reframing' aesthetics within a Reformed-Mainline tradition. Its aesthetic power is not found in poetic beauty or narrative drama, but in the 'sober beauty' of intellectual and ethical clarity. It successfully breaks the 'fixed frames' of the hearer—specifically the frame of the 'good, rule-following religious person'—and replaces it with the 'shrewd' actor of grace. The sermon is aesthetically 'honest' in its refusal to offer kitsch or easy comfort, instead opting for a prophetic realism that names the fragility of modern trust in 'mammon'. While the formal structure is somewhat static and academic, the content is vibrant and provocative.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional 'Reframing' of the biblical text for a modern economic context.",

    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Anti-kitsch) and Thomas Long (Preacher as Witness to a difficult text).",
    "audience_analysis": "Intellectually engaged, socially conscious hearers who are skeptical of traditional 'pious' language but open to radical ethical challenges.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'Lowry's Loop' to create more narrative tension.",
      "Use one sustained, concrete 'story' or 'image' that runs through the entire sermon.",
      "Read the text aloud during drafting to identify and soften 'paper language' passages."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically strong 'Open Work' that challenges the hearer's perception of reality. It avoids the pitfalls of 'aestheticism' (beauty for beauty's sake) and 'kitsch' (cheap emotion), offering instead a 'Space for Grace' that is both demanding and liberating. Its primary achievement is the 'shrewd' way it uses the language of the 'children of this age' to proclaim the Gospel of the 'eternal home'."
