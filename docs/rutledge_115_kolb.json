      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a humorous family anecdote and a critique of Sunday school imagery, which effectively hooks the listener. However, it initially distances the hearer from the 'sheep' metaphor by calling it 'icky' or 'sentimental.' It regains concrete ground later by connecting the shepherd image to the universal human experience of parental loss and the vulnerability of aging. The connection to the '90s spirituality' room provides a specific, recognizable contemporary setting.",

    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of a 'Declarative-Visionary' approach. It successfully deconstructs a sentimentalized biblical image and reconstructs it with theological and psychological depth. It falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase, providing few concrete handles for the congregation to apply the insights to their daily lives. The analysis of power and love is intellectually satisfying and emotionally resonant, particularly for those facing the 'watershed' of parental loss. However, the preacher's focus on 'biblical memory' and high Christology, while necessary, dominates the sermon at the expense of practical discipleship. The movement through the first three phases of Kolb is traceable and effective, but the cycle remains incomplete as it fails to transition into a clear ethical or practical call to action.",

      "Incorporate a 'How-To' section: Spend 3-5 minutes on the practical mechanics of 'hearing the Shepherd's voice.'",
      "Use a contemporary 'Power' narrative: Tell a story of someone using their power (or lack thereof) in a Christ-like way.",
      "End with a specific challenge: Give the congregation a 'homework' task related to the sermon's theme."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a high-quality intellectual and theological exercise that succeeds in moving the listener from a superficial understanding of the 'Good Shepherd' to a profound Christological conviction. It functions excellently as a 'priestly' and 'prophetic' word, diagnosing the human condition of vulnerability and pointing to the divine solution in Christ. However, from a Kolb perspective, it is an 'incomplete' learning experience. It excels in the 'Assimilating' quadrant but neglects the 'Converging' quadrant. The priority for improvement is to ground these lofty theological truths in the 'Active Experimentation' phase, ensuring that the 'power' of the Shepherd is not just a concept to be believed, but a reality to be practiced in the ethics of daily life."
