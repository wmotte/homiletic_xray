It identifies the 'Game' of sentimental Christmas as a form of denial and offers a reality-based alternative. The preacher avoids the Drama Triangle by refusing to 'rescue' the congregation from the 'Valley of Ashes', instead pointing to a theological reality that demands an Adult response.",

      "The transition from the 'Gatsby' analysis to the 'Bethlehem' political analysis is a sharp Adult shift that might lose the 'Free Child's' engagement.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' language to ensure the preacher remains in the 'I'm OK, You're OK' quadrant, especially when critiquing affluent lifestyles."
