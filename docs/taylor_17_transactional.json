    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically heavy, leaning heavily on the Critical Parent ego state. While it attempts to motivate toward 'greatness,' it does so by activating the listener's Adapted Child through shame and the fear of failure. The use of historical 'failures' serves as a psychological cudgel. However, it provides a clear Adult framework (the three looks) which, if stripped of the shaming language, could promote autonomy.",

      "Over-reliance on the threat of 'failure' as a motivator."

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Shift from 'Critical Parent' to 'Adult'. Instead of labeling the spies as 'cowardly' (judgment), analyze the 'fear' as a natural human emotion (observation). Invite the congregation to explore their own 'grasshopper' feelings without the threat of their 'carcasses falling' if they struggle with indecision."
