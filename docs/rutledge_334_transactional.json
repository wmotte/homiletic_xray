    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Redemption' dynamics. It begins by systematically dismantling the listener's Adult ego (competence, morality, self-worth) using a Critical Parent voice. By labeling all human effort as a 'curse,' it forces the listener into the Adapted Child position (guilt/shame). Once the listener is sufficiently 'lost,' the preacher switches to a Nurturing Parent role, offering the 'Rescuer' (Christ) as the only solution. While theologically orthodox in a Pauline sense, the psychological impact creates dependency on the religious system rather than fostering autonomous spiritual growth.",

      "Heavy reliance on shaming 'self-justification' to create a need for the message.",
      "Triangulating 'the woman in town' to create a common enemy/negative example."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the listener's Adult ego by inviting them to observe their own patterns of behavior without first condemning them as 'accursed.' Move from 'You are under a curse' to 'Let's look at the reality of our limitations together.'"
