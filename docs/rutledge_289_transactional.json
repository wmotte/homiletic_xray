    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Redemption Logic' which, while theologically sound in many traditions, relies on a Parent-Child dynamic. It effectively uses the 'ITHY' game to highlight human failure (Critical Parent) so that the grace offered (Nurturing Parent) feels more dramatic. While the examples of the two women provide powerful, reality-based Adult reflections on forgiveness, the overall framework keeps the listener in a state of 'Adapted Child' dependency on a Rescuer.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of Adult data (historical context of Jeremiah).",
      "Authentic Free Child elements in the opening and closing.",
      "Powerful real-world examples that move beyond abstract dogma."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Heavy reliance on the 'hapless'/Victim identity for the congregation.",
      "The 'Upping the Ante' section functions as a psychological 'Crossup' that increases anxiety."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation's Adult ego more consistently. Instead of 'We are in a bad fix,' ask 'How do you experience the tension between your values and your actions?' This invites reflection rather than submission."
