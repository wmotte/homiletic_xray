    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The 'Sache' is the theology of Grace and the Person of the Holy Spirit. The preacher utilizes a strong Augustinian and Barthian framework where God is the sole Subject of His own revelation ('speak to yourself for me'). The factual content is dense with biblical typologies (Susanna, Magdalen, Dismas, Peter). However, the 'blue' side is heavily submerged in the 'green' side; the doctrine of total depravity and irresistible grace is presented not as a lecture, but as a lived experience. While theologically deep, the lack of clear structural signposting for a listener makes the factual progression difficult to track without the text in hand.",
      "quotes": [
        "You must, therefore, give yourself to me so that I may become your property.",
        "It is impossible for you to withhold your mercy from me, for mercy and you are consubstantial.",
        "If you save us, it is not because we have performed righteous deeds, but because you are merciful."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "High christocentric and pneumatological concentration.",
        "Rich use of biblical exempla to illustrate the doctrine of mercy."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Theological abstractions (e.g., 'consubstantial mercy') may bypass the 'factual ear' of a lay congregation.",
        "Needs more 'teaching' moments to ground the ecstatic language."
      ],
      "comprehensibility_check": "Moderate to Low. The language is poetic and mystical, requiring a high level of theological literacy."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the dominant side. The preacher reveals a profound sense of personal unworthiness and radical dependence. There is a high degree of 'Selbstenthüllung' (self-disclosure) regarding the preacher's own struggle with sin ('adulterous murderer', 'traitor'). The 'I' is not used for ego-inflation but as a representative of the 'miserable creature'. The authenticity is palpable, bordering on the mystical. It avoids mere 'image management' by leaning into the shame of the 'torn sack' that the preacher claims to be.",
      "quotes": [
        "I hesitate, since I am not qualified.",
        "Take pity on this traitor who has driven you out.",
        "I blush with shame and confusion because you are far away."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive/Hysterical hybrid. Depressive in the longing for closeness, harmony, and the 'sweetest Spirit' to heal wounds; Hysterical in the dramatic, superlative language and the 'stage' of public lamentation.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is diaconal; it serves as a mirror for the congregation's own need for grace, though it risks overshadowing the objective Word with subjective pathos.",
      "strengths": [
        "Deeply moving authenticity.",
        "Avoids the 'Schizoid' distance of cold dogmatism."

    },
    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship to the hearer is indirect. The preacher speaks *to* God *in front of* the people. This creates a 'triangular' relationship. The preacher assumes a role of a 'fellow sufferer' or 'lead penitent'. There is little 'at eye level' address to the congregation until §2 ('O my sinful soul, get up'). The relationship is mostly 'Solidary' in sin, but the preacher occupies a 'Teaching' position through the sheer intensity of their spiritual exercise, which can feel intimidating or paternalistic to those not at that level of fervor.",
      "quotes": [
        "O my sinful soul, get up, stand straight, pay attention.",

        "Direct address to the congregation is sparse.",

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily 'internal'. The 'Anspruch' (demand) is not for moral busy-work, but for 'Faith/Rest/Trust'. The preacher demands that the soul 'receive' and 'consecrate'. The ratio of Zuspruch (Promise) to Anspruch (Demand) is well-balanced, as the demand to 'get up' is entirely predicated on the Holy Spirit being the 'only person you need'. It is a 'passive' appeal: the action required is to stop resisting God's mercy. This is theologically sound in the Barthian/Immink tradition.",
      "quotes": [
        "Consecrate all your powers to him, prepare yourself to serve as his dwelling place.",
        "Do not reject the help which can assist you so mightily.",
        "Give this poor man of yours... those weapons or treasures that enrich the poor."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Strongly tilted toward Zuspruch (Gift). The demand is merely to accept the gift.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Very low. The sermon explicitly rejects 'righteous deeds' as the basis for salvation.",
      "strengths": [
        "Theologically precise 'Law and Gospel' distinction.",
        "The appeal is for conversion of heart, not just behavior."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The appeal to 'renounce the things of this passing world' is vague and could be sharpened.",
        "The 'red' side is sometimes lost in the 'green' emotionality."

    "congruence_judgment": "Highly congruent. The preacher's tone of desperation matches the theological content of total dependence on the Spirit.",
    "dominant_side": "Green (Self-revelation)",
    "disruptions": "The main disruption is the 'theatrical' nature of the prayer. The 'yellow' side (relationship to the audience) is sacrificed for the 'green' side (relationship to God).",
    "healing_disruption": "The disruption occurs when the preacher identifies with the 'adulterous murderer' and 'traitor', forcing the congregation to confront their own hidden 'rot' and 'infection'."

  "reception_simulation": {
    "the_factual_ear_hears": "God is the primary actor; the Holy Spirit is the 'finger of God' that heals; salvation is by mercy alone, not works.",
    "the_relational_ear_hears": "The preacher is in a state of spiritual crisis or intense devotion; I am being invited to watch a soul wrestle with God.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a powerful example of 'Pneumatological Homiletics' where the preacher attempts to become a transparent medium for the Spirit. Theologically, it aligns with Barth’s insistence that God is the Subject of the sermon. Psychologically, it is dominated by the 'Green' side (Self-revelation), which provides immense authenticity but risks 'psychologizing' the faith by making the preacher's emotional state the primary vehicle for the message. The 'Yellow' side is the weakest, as the congregation is often left as an observer of a private drama. The balance between Zuspruch (Promise) and Anspruch (Demand) is excellent, avoiding moralism entirely. However, the high-register mystical language and the 'Depressive-Hysterical' intensity may alienate listeners who seek a more 'Blue' (factual/instructional) or 'Yellow' (relational/community-building) approach. It is a 'Satisfactory to Ample' performance that succeeds in depth but lacks communicative breadth for a diverse congregation.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a risk of 'Erlebnis-theologie' (experience-theology). While the preacher says God must speak, the sermon is heavily filtered through the preacher's own 'blushing shame' and 'loud cries'.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Radical theological focus on Grace.",
      "High degree of personal authenticity.",
      "Rich, evocative biblical imagery."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Increase direct 'Yellow' engagement with the congregation.",
      "Clarify 'Blue' structural markers to aid listener retention.",
      "Temper the 'Hysterical' superlatives to avoid the appearance of performance."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A theologically profound, psychologically intense sermon that serves the 'Sache' through a vulnerable 'I', though it risks communicative isolation."
