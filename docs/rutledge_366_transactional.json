        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher avoids shaming the listener. Even when mentioning the 'unheeding city' or 'wicked men,' the focus is on a cosmic struggle rather than individual moral policing.",

        "score": 8,

        "presence": "High",
        "analysis": "The Nurturing Parent is present through the validation of the listener's pain and the use of personal mentors (Paul Lehmann) to model grief. It promotes autonomy by suggesting the listener 'can trust' rather than 'must obey.'",

      "presence": "High",
      "analysis": "The preacher addresses the congregation as thinking subjects, using a 'prism' metaphor for the Gospels. There is a clear attempt to process the reality of death and suffering objectively without bypassing it with easy religious clichés.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is helpful to hear each Evangelist’s testimony from its own perspective, like turning a prism to catch different colors and patterns.",

        "presence_of_adaptation": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher speaks from a place of vulnerability ('his or her words are very feeble') rather than a place of fearful adaptation to church dogma. The congregation is invited into trust, not forced into submission.",

        "presence": "Medium",
        "analysis": "The Free Child appears in the 'zest for life' and the 'dazzling imagination' attributed to the mentor. There is an authentic emotional resonance that feels unscripted and lively despite the funereal context.",
        "quotes": [
          "Paradoxically, it gives somehow a zest for life.",

  "transaction_analysis": {
    "primary_transaction_style": "Adult -> Adult",
    "analysis": "The preacher primarily shares information and personal reflection, inviting the listener to observe the 'tension' of the Christian life. It is an invitation to co-reflection rather than a command-response sequence.",
    "ulterior_motives": "None detected. The preacher is transparent about the difficulty of the text and their own limitations.",
    "communicative_purity_score": 9,
    "purity_explanation": "10 = Completely transparent. The sermon lacks the 'double bottom' of typical religious manipulation.",
    "risk_explanation": "The only slight risk is a 'Nurturing Parent' move at the end that assumes the Father's hand is on the listener, which could be seen as an ulterior 'Rescue' if the listener does not feel that way."

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The preacher avoids 'ITHY' (I'm Only Trying To Help You) by admitting their own words are 'feeble.' They avoid 'Ain't It Awful' by framing the struggle against evil as a 'victory won' rather than a reason for passive complaining."

    "preacher_roles": {
      "rescuer": "Low. The preacher points to Christ as the one who fights the battle, rather than positioning themselves as the one with the answers.",
      "persecutor": "Absent. No blaming of the congregation or the 'unheeding city' for the crucifixion.",
      "victim": "Low. A brief moment of 'feeble words' but it serves to humanize the Adult ego rather than to solicit pity."
    },
    "congregation_position": "The congregation is treated as 'Adult' observers and 'Free Child' participants in a mystery, rather than 'Victims' needing a human Rescuer.",
    "escape_possibilities": "The sermon promotes autonomy by encouraging the listener to 'position ourselves' and 'commit yourself,' placing the responsibility of the spiritual act on the individual."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in Passion Sunday preaching. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, processing the reality of death and suffering with intellectual honesty. By acknowledging the tension between abandonment and trust, the preacher avoids the 'Bait and Switch' of offering easy grace. The use of the Nurturing Parent state is supportive rather than smothering, fostering a sense of security that allows the listener's Adult to face the reality of their own mortality without falling into the Adapted Child's fear.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of transparency regarding the preacher's own limitations.",
      "Avoidance of moralistic 'Critical Parent' language.",
      "Integration of intellectual rigor (Adult) with emotional depth (Free Child)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the final hymn slightly leans into a 'Nurturing Parent' assumption that may bypass the 'Adult' processing of a skeptic.",
      "The 'unheeding city' comment briefly flirts with an 'Ain't It Awful' game, though it is not developed."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'we' pronoun to maintain the Adult-Adult partnership. Ensure that the 'Nurturing Parent' comfort at the end remains an invitation rather than a definitive psychological claim over the listener's experience."
