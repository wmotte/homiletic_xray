  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative games. By humanizing Oscar Romero—showing his hunger, his mistakes, and his need for forgiveness—the preacher prevents the congregation from falling into a 'helpless child' position of awe. Instead, he uses an Adult-Adult transaction to invite the listeners into a shared responsibility. The focus on 'Wahrheitsfähigkeit' (ability for truth) promotes psychological autonomy and reality-testing.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Ain't it Awful' trap: While describing the suffering in El Salvador, there is a minor risk of collective passivity if the 'horror' is not balanced with local Adult-level action steps.",
      "Slightly Critical Parent tone toward the 'Vatican' or 'experts' could alienate those who value those institutions."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to share 'humanizing' anecdotes of spiritual figures. To further strengthen the Adult-Adult transaction, invite the congregation to reflect on where they *already* show 'Wahrheitsfähigkeit' in their own daily lives."
