We’ve been looking at these beliefs by using the outline of the Apostles’ Creed, which is the earliest summary of biblical doctrine the church ever used. When you get to the very end of the Apostles’ Creed [...] Fading is the worldling’s pleasure / All his boasted pomp and show / Solid joys and lasting treasure / None but Zion’s children know."

    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Revelation as a proof-text for a systematic series on the Apostles' Creed. It fails Dekker's requirement of finding what is in THIS text that is nowhere else. Instead of a specific pericope, it treats the text as a general illustration of 'the end of history' or 'progress'.",
      "quotes": [
        "We’ve been looking at these beliefs by using the outline of the Apostles’ Creed",
        "Let’s see what the Bible says, what Christians believe about the end of history"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Abandon the systematic-theological framework (Apostles' Creed) and focus exclusively on the unique imagery of the New Jerusalem and the River of Life as presented in these specific verses."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is a formal acknowledgement of the original readers (persecuted Christians in chapters 2-3), but it remains superficial. The preacher does not engage with the Greek text or the specific religious-historical context of the Roman Empire beyond a general mention of 'persecution'.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s so easy when you read the book of Revelation to forget the original readers.",
        "We know what the original readers were facing by going to the beginning of the book of Revelation... they were facing persecution."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exegesis by explaining the specific symbolic weight of the 'sea' passing away or the 'healing of the nations' in the context of first-century Roman hegemony."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is psychologically astute, particularly regarding the 'zeitgeist' of New York City and the modern appetite for fantasy. However, it leans toward general psychological truths rather than concrete ethical or political directives.",
      "quotes": [
        "The average New Yorker would think that was so quaint",
        "Those of you who live in New York City know what it’s like to live in a place that is incredibly people dense."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond psychological 'hope' to concrete applications regarding how the 'healing of the nations' (22:2) addresses specific modern political or social divisions."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is strong here. It does not separate 'the lesson' from 'the life'. The hearer is drawn into the text's imagery (the city, the bride) as a way to understand their own existence.",
      "quotes": [
        "Suddenly we have a city that’s a bride. That gets across two things.",
        "John the apostle... gave them the hope we’re about to unpack in this passage, and it is a simple fact of history that it worked."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'exposition' part doesn't rely so heavily on external anecdotes (World War II, Lion King) but stays within the textual movement of Revelation."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The triad is present. Misery is defined as the 'debilitating dilemma' of being known and rejected; redemption is the 'wedding dress' of righteousness; gratitude is the call to 'serve the city'. It avoids over-objectification.",
      "quotes": [
        "The debilitating dilemma of human nature is we want relationships and we’re afraid of relationships.",
        "Jesus Christ loves you not because you are lovely but in order to make you lovely."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Sharpen the 'misery' aspect by linking it more directly to the 'curse' mentioned in Rev 22:3 rather than just psychological fear of rejection."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are present but softened. The preacher mentions the 'angel of death' and 'judgment', but the focus is almost entirely on the invitation. The reality of being 'lost' is more of a logical possibility than a sobering warning.",
      "quotes": [
        "I could understand why you’d come to the conclusion that it’s not true, but I have no idea why you wouldn’t want it to be true.",
        "Because of your sin, you need to be judged and you need to lose all hope."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the exclusion from the city (implied in the text's boundaries) more directly to emphasize the gravity of the human choice."

      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The move to the 'Lamb' as the substitute is the theological climax. The sermon successfully points to salvation outside the self.",
      "quotes": [
        "Behold the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world.",
        "Man has no life in himself, it is Christ who is his life. [Paraphrased via substitution logic]"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'Lamb' more specifically to the 'River of Life' in chapter 22 to show how Christ’s deity sustains the new creation."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At approximately 24 minutes, the sermon allows for the 'breadth' Miskotte and Dekker demand. It takes time to explore the cultural philosophy of progress and the psychology of hope.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let’s see what these texts... say under these three headings."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this length but replace the lengthy secular anecdotes with more rigorous textual exposition."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of communicative preaching but falls short of Dekker's 'formal' ideal by subordinating the Bible passage to a systematic series (Apostles' Creed). It relies heavily on humanities and anecdotes (Tolkien, Updike, Nisbet) which, while effective for application, occasionally cause the specific exegesis of Revelation to 'sleep' too deeply. The Christocentric focus on the Lamb is the sermon's theological anchor.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective use of the 'already/not yet' tension to provide a realistic hope.",
      "Strong Christocentric finish using the substitutionary logic of the Lamb.",
      "Adequate length allowing for intellectual and spiritual depth."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The specific text is treated as an illustration for a creedal point rather than the primary driver.",
      "Exegesis of the original Greek/Hebrew context is largely absent in favor of modern psychological analysis.",
      "The 'two ways' (the possibility of being lost) is present but lacks the 'sharpness' Dekker expects."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'strong' sermon (Score: 6.5/10) that functions well as application but borders on being a 'speech about the gospel' rather than a strict 'exposition of this specific passage'. It meets the substantive requirements (3-2-1 rule) but needs more exegetical rigor to meet Dekker's formal definition."
