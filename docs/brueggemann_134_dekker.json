  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon focuses on Jeremiah 31. It identifies a unique element: the 'surgical implant' of the Torah on the heart. However, it leans heavily on Deuteronomy to explain the content of the heart, which risks diluting the specific 'nowhere else' quality of the Jeremiah passage by importing external texts.",
      "quotes": [
        "The fundamental question in making the sermon is: what is in this Bible passage that you can find NOWHERE else in the Bible?",
        "Imagine, a Torah written on the heart; the regulations of Deuteronomy written on your body."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more sharply on the radical interiority of the 'new' in Jeremiah rather than filling it with the 'old' content of Deuteronomy."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates historical awareness of the Babylonian exile and the linguistic weight of the 'I' of God. However, the exegesis is more poetic than technical; there is no explicit engagement with the Hebrew text or the specific theological tensions of the book of Jeremiah beyond the surface narrative.",
      "quotes": [
        "It was a dismal moment in the life of God’s people. The capital city was in ruins.",
        "The word Torah, in this tradition, no doubt refers to the commandments in the book of Deuteronomy."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate more rigorous exegetical depth regarding why this specific 'new covenant' was necessary in contrast to the Mosaic covenant's structure."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application attempts concreteness regarding debt and international power, but it remains somewhat categorized in general political 'types' (greed, power, certitude). It lacks the specific 'spiritual life of the congregation' detail Dekker requires.",
      "quotes": [
        "The old way of greed in the domestic economy in which the big ones eat the little ones until the little ones are locked hopelessly into debt.",
        "The old way of ruthless power in international affairs has failed... I will not even mention torture."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond broad socio-political critiques to the concrete 'zeitgeist' affecting the specific hearers' personal and spiritual lives."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a rigid 'block' structure: Section I and II are historical/textual, Section III is application. This is exactly what Dekker warns against; the exposition and application are separated rather than mixed.",
      "quotes": [
        "Well, it is all ancient history, sixth century BCE. Except that this is now our text.",
        "So it occurs to me that this text may give us a good agenda for Lenten work."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Abolish the 'then' and 'now' divide. Draw the hearer into the text from the first paragraph so the 'present of revelation' occurs throughout."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Misery (the exile/failure) and Redemption (the new covenant/forgiveness) are present. Gratitude (obedience) is framed as 'Lenten work.' However, the 'misery' feels more like a historical/political failure than a theological misery 'before God.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The assault on Jerusalem had put faith into free fall...",
        "The final word of divine possibility for a society in free fall is forgiveness."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the sense of 'misery' to include the internal inability of the human heart to keep the law, necessitating the 'surgical implant'."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon avoids the 'two ways' almost entirely. While it mentions the 'old way' has failed, it lacks the gravity of being 'lost' or the ultimate consequences of the 'broad way.' It feels safe and descriptive rather than urgent.",
      "quotes": [
        "The first Lenten task is to recognize that the whole package of greed and fear and violence and certitude is no way into the future."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the reality of being 'lost in time' if the calling of the new covenant is ignored."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "Christ is entirely absent from the text. While Dekker allows the Scripture passage to dictate the extent, he states 'in no sermon can Christ be completely silenced.' This sermon remains entirely within a (Brueggemann-esque) Old Testament framework without reaching its telos in Christ.",
      "quotes": [
        "The one Lord who is central in the sermon is Christ.",
        "As we listen the Spirit does tell us more."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'etched in flesh' motif to the Incarnate Word (Christ) to provide a theological telos."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1350 words, the sermon lasts about 13-14 minutes. This falls significantly short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum for 'depth needing breadth.'",
      "quotes": [
        "A sermon that lasts less than 20 minutes cannot be a sermon."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical and dogmatic 'breadth' to allow the text to breathe and the application to become more granular."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon functions more as a poetic lecture on prophetic imagination than a sermon according to Dekker’s criteria. It fails the length requirement, lacks a Christological telos, and maintains a strict separation between biblical exposition and contemporary application. While it captures the 'misery' of the exile well, it avoids the 'two ways' and the gravity of being lost.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of the 'I' of God as the subject of the new beginning.",
      "Effective metaphor of the 'surgical implant' for the law on the heart.",
      "Clear identification of the failure of 'old ways'."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Total absence of Christ as the telos of the Word.",
      "Insufficient length to achieve the required 'breadth' for depth.",
      "Separation of exposition and application into distinct chronological blocks.",
      "Lack of the 'two ways' urgency."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This text is an insightful biblical reflection but, by Dekker's standards, it is not yet a sermon. It lacks the necessary length, the Trinitarian/Christological anchor, and the interwoven structure required for the 'present of revelation'."
