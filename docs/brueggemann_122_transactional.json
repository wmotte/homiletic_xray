    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' common in homiletics. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, inviting the congregation into a partnership of 'shared disciplines.' By externalizing the 'Persecutor' (the predatory economy/empire), the preacher avoids shaming the congregation (Critical Parent), instead offering them the agency (Adult) to choose a 'more excellent way.' The focus on 'gratitude' serves as a healthy Nurturing Parent anchor that prevents the call to discipline from becoming legalistic.",

      "High level of Adult-to-Adult respect.",

      "Promotes autonomy through the concept of 'disciplines'."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'imagined letter' device is effective but borders on a 'Parent' projection of how the future must look.",
      "Could incorporate more 'Free Child' spontaneity to balance the heavy Adult/intellectual framework."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' and 'us' when discussing the challenges of the empire to ensure the preacher remains on the same level as the congregation, avoiding the 'Rescuer' trap."
