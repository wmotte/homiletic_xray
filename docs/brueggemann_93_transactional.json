    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and largely game-free. It avoids the traditional 'Critical Parent' traps of religious discourse by reframing 'sin' as systemic 'snares' and 'salvation' as an empowering 'drama' of gratitude. The preacher maintains an Adult-Adult transaction, inviting the listener to observe their own life through the lens of the text without coercive pressure. By acknowledging the difficulty of traditional atonement language, the preacher builds trust and transparency.",
    "strengths": [

      "The 'Adult' analysis of the three points could feel slightly intellectualized for some 'Free Child' listeners.",
      "A slight risk of 'Ain't It Awful' when discussing 'state policy' and 'propaganda' if not balanced with specific local hope."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'we' pronoun to maintain solidarity. Keep the 'Adult' ego state engaged by asking the congregation questions that require their own reality-testing of the 'snares' they face."
