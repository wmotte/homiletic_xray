    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes strong, contrasting imagery to bridge the gap between existential dread and theological hope. Rutledge employs the 'vast, moth-eaten musical brocade' of Larkin's poetry as a recurring visual metaphor for hollow religion, which she then juxtaposes with the 'dry bones' of Ezekiel and the 'stinking' reality of Lazarus's death. The imagery is not merely decorative; it serves a diagnostic purpose, forcing the hearer to 'see' the decay before seeing the resurrection. However, the imagery remains largely literary and biblical; there is less 'sensory' detail regarding contemporary life, relying instead on the historical weight of the Holocaust and Nazi Germany to provide concrete grounding.",
      "quotes": [
        "That vast, moth-eaten musical brocade created to pretend we never die.",
        "The people are dragged off as captives to an unthinkable place: mighty Babylon, dominated by colossal statues of brutal and capricious gods.",

        "Incorporate more contemporary, everyday sensory details to ground the 'reframing'.",
        "The imagery of the 'earthen vessel' is a bit clichéd; a fresher metaphor for human frailty could increase impact.",
        "Expand on the sensory experience of the 'dryness' in Ezekiel to heighten the contrast with the 'breath'."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Rutledge exhibits high stewardship of language, consistent with McEntyre’s criteria. Her word choice is economical and precise. She avoids 'Canaanite' jargon, or where she uses theological terms like 'apostasy' or 'incarnate', they are embedded in a narrative that clarifies their weight. The distinction between 'sentiment' and 'faith' is handled with surgical precision. The language is sophisticated yet accessible, reflecting a high level of intellectual and spiritual care. Every sentence feels intentional, particularly in the transition from the 'arid interrogation' of death to the 'unconditional promise' of God.",
      "quotes": [
        "He does not raise them from the dust because they have repented. He raises them from the dust because he is their God.",
        "The raising of Lazarus is to be a sign... that will set in motion the plots that lead to his death.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a dignified, liturgical rhythm. Rutledge uses parallelism and repetition (e.g., 'in the midst of life... in the midst of death') to create a sense of gravitas. The sentence structure varies effectively between the short, punchy declarations of the Gospel and the longer, more reflective periods of the Von Moltke narrative. It is clearly a text written for the ear, with a cadence that suggests a deliberate, measured delivery. The use of poetry at the beginning sets a rhythmic 'key' that the rest of the sermon modulates from.",
      "quotes": [
        "Not to be here, Not to be anywhere, And soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.",

        "More use of alliteration or assonance could enhance the 'musicality' of the theological climaxes."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Primarily oral language; the structure suggests a performance intended for a large acoustic space."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' that avoids kitsch through intellectual rigor and poetic restraint. Rutledge uses imagery not to decorate, but to 'reframe' reality, moving from the 'arid' dread of death to the 'extravagant' promise of God. Her stewardship of language is evident in the precision of her theological claims and the rhythmic dignity of her prose. While it leans toward the literary, it remains firmly grounded in the oral tradition of the pulpit, prioritizing clarity and the 'Word of the Lord' over rhetorical flourish."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a masterful 'homiletical plot' (Lowry). It begins by upsetting the equilibrium with the 'terrible truth' of death, moves through the 'complications' of Israel’s exile and Lazarus’s delay, and reaches a climax in the Von Moltke story. The 'turning point' is not a human feeling but the 'speaking of God'. The tension is sustained by the recurring question: 'Are we here to pretend?' This question is only resolved in the final 'Yes' of Martha, which the congregation is invited to inhabit. The movement from A (universal death) to B (specific resurrection) is dynamic and compelling.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is what we know about each other: we’re all going to die.",
        "Is this worship today... a 'vast, moth-eaten musical brocade,' and are we here to pretend?",

        "The 'hook' of the opening is immediate and unavoidable.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The exegetical bridge between Ezekiel and John could be more narratively integrated.",
        "The 'hastening on' to the New Testament feels like a slight drop in the dramatic tension.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a prime example of Cilliers’ 'reframing'. Rutledge takes the 'dry bones' and 'Lazarus' and reframes the 20th-century experience of the Holocaust and Nazi resistance through them. She respects the 'strangeness' of the biblical text (God’s delay, the unconditional nature of the promise) while making it urgently relevant to a congregation in the National Cathedral. The integration is organic because it focuses on the universal human condition (death) and the specific divine actor (the God who raises the dead). It avoids the 'springboard' trap by staying deeply rooted in the biblical logic.",
      "quotes": [
        "Christians hearing it with a Jewish sensibility can perhaps think of it in the context of the Holocaust.",
        "He delays precisely in order to show his love.",

        "Could have made a more explicit connection to the specific 'Washington D.C.' context of power and monuments.",
        "The transition from the 'Spirituals' to 'Lazarus' is a bit quick.",
        "More 'reframing' of the hearer's immediate, mundane fears (beyond the 'big' fear of death) could increase intimacy."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing: reality is seen through the lens of the 'God who raises the dead' rather than the lens of 'unresting death'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is theologically 'closed' in its insistence on the 'extra nos' of God's action, it remains an 'open work of art' (Stark) by ending with a direct question to the hearer. It does not resolve the tension of death with a 'happy ending' but with a 'confession' in the face of death. However, the strong emphasis on the 'unconditional promise' and the authoritative tone leaves less room for the 'ambivalence and doubt' that Stark advocates for. The hearer is invited to believe, but the path to that belief is quite narrowly defined by the preacher’s theological framework.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let’s hold that question in our minds for a few minutes.",
        "Do you believe this?",
        "May the Spirit move our hearts today to join Martha in her confession."

      "strengths": [
        "The ending is an invitation, not a command.",
        "Acknowledges the 'arid interrogation' of death without offering cheap comfort.",
        "The use of Larkin allows the 'voice of the skeptic' to remain present throughout."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The theological 'verdict' is delivered with such authority that it might feel 'sealed shut' to a searching hearer.",
        "Could allow more room for the 'resistance' to the message that Stark mentions.",
        "The 'Amen' follows the question very quickly; more 'open space' could be left for the hearer's internal response."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "A 'semi-open' work; it poses the right questions but provides a very specific, authoritative answer."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are characterized by a powerful narrative arc that moves from the universal problem of death to the specific event of resurrection. The structure is dramaturgically sound, using historical narrative (Von Moltke) to ground biblical truth. The integration of text and context is a successful 'reframing' of 20th-century trauma through the lens of Scripture. While the sermon is theologically authoritative, the use of the 'open question' at the end prevents it from being entirely 'closed', though it leans more toward 'witness' than 'exploration'."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is a profound rejection of religious kitsch. Rutledge explicitly identifies and attacks 'kitsch' (the 'moth-eaten musical brocade' that pretends we never die). She refuses to offer immediate comfort or a 'happy ending' that bypasses the grave. By using Larkin and the Holocaust, she takes the 'pain of suffering' with absolute seriousness. The emotion is authentic because it is rooted in the 'terrible truth' of death and the 'extravagant' cost of grace, rather than sentimental platitudes.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'vast, moth-eaten musical brocade' (identified as the kitsch to be avoided).",
      "The potential 'pretending' that religion often facilitates."

      "The description of Von Moltke standing before the judge as 'a Christian and nothing else'.",
      "The acknowledgment that Lazarus's death was 'no use to us now!' in Martha's grief."

    "recommendation": "Maintain this rigorous 'anti-kitsch' stance by continuing to allow secular voices (like Larkin) to challenge the 'easy' religious answers."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully 'opens space for grace' by emphasizing that God's action is unconditional and independent of human repentance or merit. Cilliers' concept of 'inter-esse' is present in the tension between the 'already' of Christ's resurrection and the 'not yet' of our own death. By refusing to moralize (it's not about 'doing better'), Rutledge leaves the space entirely for God's 'Spirit' to move. The 'mystery' of God's timing is respected rather than explained away.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'unresting death' and 'the Resurrection' is sustained until the very last sentence.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'infinite detours' of God's providence in Von Moltke's life are presented as a mystery that only makes sense 'in retrospect'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails entirely; there is no 'moralizing' task, only the 'witness' to God's act.",
    "recommendation": "To increase the 'space', the preacher could occasionally use more 'tentative' language to invite the hearer into the mystery of how grace works in the mundane."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.7,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'Theological Realism' in the Reformed tradition. It excels in its 'anti-kitsch' stance, refusing to offer cheap consolation in the face of death. The poetics of language are characterized by a 'sober beauty' and a high degree of stewardship, utilizing secular poetry and historical narrative to 'reframe' the biblical text for a modern audience. The dramaturgy is strong, creating a clear arc of tension that moves from the universal 'dread' of non-existence to the specific 'event' of God's life-giving Word. While the tone is authoritative and the theological framework is 'closed' in its Christocentrism, the structural use of the 'open question' at the end creates a space for the hearer's appropriation. It is a sermon that 'shows' the power of God through the 'trouble' of history, avoiding the pitfalls of both dry intellectualism and shallow emotionalism.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rigorous avoidance of religious kitsch and sentimentalism.",
      "Masterful 'reframing' of historical trauma (Holocaust/Nazism) through biblical narrative.",

      "Increase sensory 'showing' in the contemporary application.",
      "Allow for more 'openness' and 'ambivalence' in the hearer's journey.",

    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'homely' metaphors to balance the 'majestic' ones.",
      "Incorporate a moment of 'liturgical silence' into the written structure.",
      "Use the 'Four Pages' model to ensure the 'Grace in the World' page is as vivid as the 'Grace in the Text' page."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A high-quality aesthetic event that honors the 'gravity' of the human condition while 'opening space' for the 'extravagance' of grace. It is a model of how to use 'secular' aesthetics (poetry, history) to serve 'sacred' ends without compromising either. The sermon does not draw attention to the preacher's 'virtuosity' but remains transparent toward the 'Divine Actor'."
