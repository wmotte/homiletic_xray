    "summary": "This sermon is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It avoids the common 'Critical Parent' trap of religious discourse. Instead, it uses the Adult ego state to validate the listener's intellectual environment (skepticism) and the Nurturing Parent to provide a safe space for emotional experience (Free Child). By identifying with the 'common' disciples, the preacher levels the hierarchy, preventing a Parent-Child power struggle. The use of the nursing home story grounds the high-level theology in a vulnerable, human reality, inviting authentic connection rather than forced belief.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to explicitly name the 'unprovability' of the message; it protects the Adult-Adult contract and prevents the 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' game."
