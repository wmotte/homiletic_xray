It utilizes a 'shame-based' homiletic that requires the listener to adopt a 'No-OK' position ('no health in us') to make the 'God-is-OK' position meaningful. While it uses the language of love, it creates a dependency loop where the listener must feel 'miserable' to experience 'mercy.' This reinforces an Adapted Child ego state rather than an Adult faith.",
