  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The sermon lacks a specific biblical pericope as its foundation. It functions as a topical speech on racial justice and ecclesiastical impotence, using biblical motifs as ornaments rather than as the source. It fails Dekker's primary requirement: it is a speech about 'the gospel' or 'racial issues' rather than an exposition of a specific text.",

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 1,
      "findings": "There is no formal exegesis. The preacher does not engage with the original context, Hebrew/Greek, or the historical-theological setting of any specific Bible book. The sermon relies on anecdotes and contemporary social analysis.",
      "quotes": [
        "The glory of the New Testament was that the disciples had found in Christ a power.",
        "Listen to them. Even by the name of Jesus of Nazareth..."

    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is the sermon's strongest point. The application is highly concrete, addressing the zeitgeist of racial segregation, political expediency, and church hypocrisy with sharp, sociological precision. It avoids 'general truths' by naming specific social failures.",
      "quotes": [
        "Christians cannot live where the population is not white, Gentile, Republican, Protestant, and third generation.",
        "I blush to say that he was Baptist, who said that if the Supreme Court... finds segregation illegal, 311,000 Baptists are ready to throw the cloak of religion..."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Because there is no sustained exposition, there is nothing to interweave. The sermon is almost entirely application. The 'present of revelation' is hindered because the text is not allowed to speak in its own right.",
      "quotes": [
        "I do not hold with those people who say that we do not preach human rights..."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The triad is present in the background. Misery is defined as racial bigotry and spiritual impotence; Redemption is the 'Power in the Cross'; Gratitude is the 'oneness' and 'service'. It successfully avoids a purely objective Christocentrism by focusing on the 'smitten' human subject.",
      "quotes": [
        "I stand before you tonight smitten with shame...",
        "At the place of the tree we find our deliverance."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon hints at the 'two ways' through the choice between 'expediency' and 'discipleship'. It warns of 'temporal loss' (the destruction of society/church), but the 'eternal loss' is less pronounced.",
      "quotes": [
        "The world does not take us Christians seriously because we do not take our discipleship seriously.",
        "I shudder to think of what bitter rejoinders will be flung in their teeth..."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, specifically as the source of power to overcome social chasms. The sermon correctly identifies that 'education alone' is insufficient, pointing to salvation outside the self. However, it leans toward Christ as a 'power-source' for social change rather than the ontological Savior of the two-natures doctrine.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have a Christ, a person — real, compelling, sustaining, empowering...",
        "There is power in that cross to take the flinty rock of our selfishness and to turn it into gushing fountains of service..."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "At approximately 23 minutes, the sermon meets the minimum requirement for breadth. It allows for rhetorical development and multiple concrete examples, avoiding the 'short speech' trap.",
      "improvement_point": "Use the available time to include the missing exegetical depth required by Thesis 2."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon fails the primary formal definition of a sermon according to Dekker: it is not an exposition of a specific Bible passage. It functions as a powerful social and moral appeal (an 'address' or 'speech') rather than a 'recreation of the written Word into a current proclamatory word.' While it excels in concrete application and psychological/sociological insight, it lacks the exegetical rigor and textual specificity Dekker demands.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application: Boldly names specific sins of the congregation and society.",
      "Human-oriented: Effectively addresses the 'misery' of the human subject in a specific historical moment.",
      "Rhetorical breadth: Takes the necessary time to build a case and move the hearer."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specific pericope: The sermon is 'about' themes, not 'from' a text.",
      "Absence of exegesis: No engagement with original languages or historical context of Scripture.",
      "Theological 'sleeping': Dogma and exegesis are not just sleeping; they are largely absent in favor of moral exhortation."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "According to Dekker’s strict criteria, this is not a sermon but a 'speech about the gospel.' It lacks the formal necessity of being an exposition of a specific passage that says something found 'nowhere else' in the Bible."
