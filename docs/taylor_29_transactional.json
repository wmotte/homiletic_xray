    "summary": "This sermon is a classic example of Parent-Child homiletics. While rhetorically powerful and aesthetically rich, it relies heavily on inducing guilt and shame. It uses the 'NIGYSOB' game to strip the listener of their 'mask,' leaving them vulnerable to a demand for 'reckless' surrender. The psychological impact is one of increased dependency on the religious institution (the 'march') to alleviate the guilt produced by the sermon itself.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as Adult subjects. Instead of telling them what is 'underneath their mask,' ask them to reflect on their own experiences of faith. Move from 'You ought to tremble' to 'How do we respond to this kind of kingship?'"
