    "summary": "This sermon is an exceptionally healthy example of game-free communication. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, utilizing historical data and honest personal reflection to build a bridge to the Nurturing Parent and Free Child. By admitting his own flaws and the 'rough and tumble' of faculty life, the preacher avoids the 'holier-than-thou' Persecutor role. The use of the Ephesians text is descriptive rather than prescriptive, which prevents the listener from falling into the Adapted Child role of guilt-driven compliance.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using the 'I' voice when discussing spiritual growth. By sharing your own process of 'coming to terms' with the tradition, you invite the congregation into an Adult-Adult partnership of discovery."
