    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically taxing. It operates primarily from a Critical Parent position, using fear and shame as primary motivators. By equating moral failure with the 'mangled body' of a jumper hitting the pavement, it creates a high-anxiety environment where grace is absent and 'God cannot save us' from the law. The listener is infantilized and shamed for their 'weariness'.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try moving from 'Must' and 'Warning' to 'Observation' and 'Invitation'. Instead of using gravity as a threat, use it as an Adult data point for how life works, allowing the listener to choose their 'investment' without the threat of being called a 'prize fool'."
