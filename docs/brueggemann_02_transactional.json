      "presence": "High",
      "analysis": "The preacher treats the congregation as thinking subjects, analyzing the 'oxymoron' of eternal life and the 'pedagogy' of Jesus. It is an Adult-to-Adult exploration of how a story functions.",

        "presence_of_adaptation": "Low",

  "transaction_analysis": {
    "primary_transaction_style": "Adult -> Adult",

    "purity_explanation": "10 = Completely transparent. The sermon is highly analytical and lacks the double-bottoms typical of religious manipulation.",
    "risk_explanation": "The only risk is a subtle 'Bait & Switch' where the 'Adult' analysis suddenly turns into a 'Parental' command ('Do it'), but this is framed as Jesus' command, not the preacher's."

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The sermon avoids games by refusing to 'Rescue' the listener from the 'brutality' of the story. It doesn't use 'Ain't It Awful' to bond over external enemies; instead, it implicates the listener's humanity in the brutality described."

      "rescuer": "Low. Does not offer a simple 'three steps to heaven' fix.",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in homiletics. By maintaining an Adult ego position, the preacher respects the listener's agency. The analysis of the 'shift' from eternal life to mercy functions as a reality-test (Adult) rather than a moralistic guilt-trip (Critical Parent). The preacher avoids the Drama Triangle by refusing to play the Rescuer, leaving the 'cost' of the Gospel visible and un-sanitized.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult communication.",
      "Avoidance of sentimental 'smothering' (NP).",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Could incorporate more 'Free Child' joy to balance the 'brutality' of the Adult analysis.",
      "The ending 'Do it' is a sharp shift to Parent that could be softened into an Adult invitation."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'pedagogical' approach where the listener is encouraged to find the answer within the narrative structure. This maintains the Adult-Adult circuit and prevents the 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' game."
