        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher does not use the pulpit to scold or demand moral performance. Even when discussing 'sin,' it is framed as a state from which one is raised rather than a list of failures.",
        "quotes": [
          "We are accustomed to hearing stories of Jesus turning away from people who will not believe... so it is startling when he graciously appears."

        "score": 9,

        "presence": "High",
        "analysis": "The Nurturing Parent is present through empathy for the bereaved and the doubting. It promotes autonomy by acknowledging that the preacher also struggles.",
        "quotes": [
          "It is a very comforting thing to me, in my own struggle to believe...",

      "analysis": "The preacher addresses the listener as a thinking subject, acknowledging modern skepticism and scientific reality (evolution) while maintaining the integrity of the text.",

        "presence_of_adaptation": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher explicitly rejects the 'trained from birth not to question God' stance, inviting an authentic rather than a compliant response.",

        "presence": "Medium",
        "analysis": "The Free Child manifests as 'wonder' and 'mystery' rather than playfulness. It is the source of the 'Alleluia' and the fascination with the 'beasts of the field.'",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon series is psychologically robust. It avoids the common ecclesiastical game of 'Bait and Switch' (promising happiness, delivering duty). Instead, it validates the listener's 'Adult' reality of suffering and doubt while offering a 'Nurturing Parent' perspective of hope. It promotes autonomy by allowing the listener to 'shake their fist' at God, thereby moving past the 'Adapted Child' stage of religion into an authentic 'Free Child' wonder.",
    "strengths": [
      "Validation of doubt and pain as healthy components of faith.",
      "Avoidance of coercive 'Critical Parent' language.",
      "High level of transparency regarding the preacher's own ego state."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the 'Why' to the 'Who' could be seen as a slight 'Rescuer' move if not handled carefully.",
      "More 'Free Child' spontaneity could balance the heavy 'Adult' processing of grief."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements regarding struggle. This maintains the Adult-Adult transaction and prevents the preacher from slipping into a 'Rescuer' role who has all the answers."
