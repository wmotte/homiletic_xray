    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon employs imagery primarily to bridge the gap between the biblical text and modern psychological states. The preacher uses sensory-adjacent language like 'horror-stricken' and 'tempest of emotion' to describe Gethsemane. However, the imagery often remains within the realm of emotional description rather than visual 'painting.' While it effectively describes the internal landscape of Christ, it lacks the vivid, concrete external details (the 'stench' or 'texture' of the garden) that Paul Scott Wilson advocates for. The imagery is more 'affective' than 'cinematic.' It succeeds in making the 'agony' less stale by using modern parallels like 'shredding files,' yet the biblical scenes themselves are summarized rather than fully visualized.",
      "quotes": [
        "overtaken by such a tempest of emotion",
        "corporate executives will fake documents and shred files",
        "the centurion — a pagan, a foreigner, a hated oppressor, one of those who nailed Jesus to the Cross"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of modern 'secular' imagery (shredding files) to illustrate the fear of abandonment.",
        "Strong emotional vocabulary that revitalizes 'stale' theological terms.",
        "Clear contrast between the 'celebration' of the start and the 'catastrophe' of the end."

        "Incorporate more sensory details of the Gethsemane setting (the cold, the shadows, the physical weight).",

        "Develop the metaphor of the 'cup' beyond its biblical citation."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "The sermon leans toward 'telling.' It explains the significance of the emotions rather than allowing the scene's details to evoke them naturally."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and exhibits high 'stewardship of language' as defined by McEntyre. The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by carefully unpacking theological concepts like 'dereliction' and 'substitution.' There is a clear effort to distinguish between 'sentiment' and 'authentic emotion.' The word choice is sophisticated yet accessible, showing a deep respect for the nuances of the text (e.g., the distinction between the dread of death and the dread of Godforsakenness). The sentence structure is disciplined, reflecting the 'sober beauty' characteristic of the Reformed/Anglican tradition.",
      "quotes": [
        "The dread of Jesus in the garden is not the dread of death; it is the dread of the Godforsakenness of sin.",
        "traditional names... roll off the tongue with the ease and thoughtlessness of familiarity.",
        "not weighing our merits, but pardoning our offenses."

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a dignified, liturgical rhythm. It uses parallelism and balanced clauses ('It begins in celebration, and it ends in catastrophe') to create a sense of gravitas. The cadence is steady, suitable for a 'Sunday of the Passion.' There is a noticeable shift in rhythm when moving from the 'trouble' of the garden to the 'deliverance' of the cross—the sentences become more declarative and rhythmic. While it lacks the 'staccato' energy of a more narrative-driven sermon, its 'legato' flow matches the solemnity of the subject matter. It is clearly written for the ear, with a natural oral 'flow.'",
      "quotes": [
        "We come in joyful, and we go out stricken.",
        "He has looked upon it and lamented it; he has denounced it; he has forgiven it...",
        "his dereliction the overwhelming joy of our deliverance."

        "Effective use of antithesis (joy/stricken, dereliction/deliverance).",

        "A clear 'pulse' that mirrors the liturgical movement of Holy Week."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Introduce more variation in sentence length to prevent a hypnotic, overly-steady rhythm.",
        "Use more alliteration or assonance to make key theological points 'stick' more effectively.",
        "The middle section becomes slightly 'essay-like' in its rhythm; it could benefit from more rhetorical questions."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Oral language. The structure and rhythm are clearly designed for public proclamation."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high level of linguistic care and precision. It avoids religious kitsch by refusing to simplify the 'scandal' of Christ's suffering. While the imagery is more psychological than sensory, it effectively 'reframes' the biblical narrative for a modern audience. The rhythm is dignified and liturgical, reflecting a 'sober beauty' that prioritizes clarity and theological depth over rhetorical flourish. It is the language of a 'witness' (Long) who treats words as sacred instruments of truth."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium'—challenging the hearer's comfort on Palm Sunday. It introduces a 'stumbling block' (the Cry of Dereliction) and moves through a period of 'struggle' (the Gethsemane analysis) before reaching the 'turning point' where the Father and Son act together in love. The movement from 'dereliction' to 'deliverance' provides a satisfying narrative arc. However, the energy occasionally flags during the more didactic explanation of Habakkuk and Paul, which feels more like a lecture than a journey.",
      "quotes": [
        "This day is not for the faint of heart.",
        "I struggled for years with this question before I found the interpretation...",
        "as we do, in that same moment, we shall recognize..."

        "Strong opening that creates immediate tension and 'buy-in.'",

        "A conclusion that resolves the tension introduced at the beginning."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Tighten the transition between the Gethsemane analysis and the modern application to maintain momentum.",
        "The 'invitation' at the end could be more dramatically integrated into the 'event' of the sermon.",
        "Reduce the academic 'scaffolding' (e.g., 'Let us follow Mark') to keep the hearer in the story."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey from the 'strangeness' of the day to the 'joy' of the gospel, though with some didactic pauses."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong example of Cilliers' 'reframing.' The preacher takes the 'strange' and 'scandalous' text and places it within the frame of universal human fears (abandonment, loss of power). The connection between the 'corporate executive' and 'Gethsemane' is surprising yet feels organic within the sermon's logic. The 'strangeness' of the biblical text is not smoothed over; rather, it is used as the key to unlocking the hearer's own reality. The integration of the parishioner's meditation (Birgbauer) further grounds the high theology in the concrete life of the local congregation.",
      "quotes": [
        "Fear of abandonment is perhaps the greatest fear of all...",
        "Residents of exclusive communities... will go ballistic if there is the slightest threat to their way of life.",
        "The meaning of Christ’s Cross is as near to you as your own heart."

      "strengths": [
        "Authentic 'reframing' of sin as the fear of abandonment.",
        "Honoring the 'otherness' of the Aramaic cries while making them relevant.",
        "Seamless movement between the 1st-century text and 20th-century Grosse Pointe context."

        "The transition to the 'woman who wouldn't say Crucify him' could be more gently handled to avoid sounding judgmental.",

        "Deepen the 'reframing' of the 'cup' metaphor for modern life."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes. It reframes the Passion not as a historical tragedy but as a contemporary deliverance from the fear of abandonment."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is somewhat 'closed' in its theological resolution. While it acknowledges the 'mystery' and 'scandal,' it ultimately provides a very specific, traditional interpretation of substitutionary atonement to 'solve' the problem. Following Stark's 'open work of art,' the sermon could leave more room for the hearer's own struggle with the 'silence of God.' The ending is an invitation, but it is a prescriptive one ('Let us not withdraw'). It functions more as a 'witness' (Long) than an 'open work' (Stark), aiming for a specific response of faith and repentance.",
      "quotes": [
        "This question demands an answer.",
        "I found the interpretation that seemed to me to point in the right direction.",
        "There is no better moment than this very day to give ourselves to him..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The invitation is clear and direct.",
        "Acknowledges the difficulty and 'struggle' of interpretation.",
        "Creates a space for the hearer to 'enter into the Passion.'"

      "improvement_points": [
        "Allow the 'Cry of Dereliction' to echo longer without immediate theological explanation.",
        "Pose more open-ended questions that allow the hearer to find their own place in the 'crowd.'",
        "Avoid 'solving' the scandal too quickly; let the 'strangeness' linger."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent. It seeks to lead the hearer to a specific theological and existential conclusion."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon is structurally sound, moving from the 'upsetting' reality of the Passion to a clear resolution in the Gospel. It excels at 'reframing' ancient theological concepts for a modern, affluent audience by identifying the universal fear of abandonment. While it leans toward a 'closed' theological system, it maintains a narrative arc that keeps the hearer engaged. The integration of text and context is its greatest structural strength, successfully bridging the gap between Gethsemane and Grosse Pointe."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It explicitly rejects 'cheap comfort' and 'happy endings' that do not take the pain of suffering seriously. By focusing on the 'Cry of Dereliction' and the 'horror' of Gethsemane, the preacher avoids the 'pre-chewed emotions' Cilliers warns against. The refusal to 'smooth over' the woman's refusal to say 'Crucify him' is a direct confrontation with the desire for religious kitsch (the desire to remain 'righteous'). The emotion is authentic because it is rooted in the 'darkness' of the text.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None found. The sermon actively deconstructs potential kitsch (e.g., the 'familiarity' of the story)."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission of the preacher's own years of struggle with the text.",
      "The refusal to offer a 'sentimental' view of the Father-Son relationship on the cross."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Continue to lean into the 'scandal' and 'strangeness' of the text to prevent the gospel from becoming a 'commodity.'"
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by taking the 'weight of sin' and the 'fear of abandonment' seriously. By 'reframing' the cross as the Father and Son acting together in love, the sermon moves away from a purely moralistic 'we must' to a 'God has done.' However, the space is slightly constricted by the very specific 'substitutionary' framework which, while theologically consistent, leaves less room for the 'mystery' of the atonement that other traditions might emphasize. The 'Space for Grace' is found in the invitation to 'repentance' as a source of power.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained through the analysis of Gethsemane but resolved perhaps a bit too neatly in the final paragraph.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of Christ's internal struggle is respected, though the theological 'answer' is presented as definitive.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. The 'imperative' (repentance) is presented as a response to the 'indicative' (deliverance).",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'silence' of the Saturday between the Passion and the Resurrection to inhabit the sermon more fully."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.3,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of 'Sober-Reformed/Anglican' aesthetics. Its primary strength lies in its 'stewardship of language' and its ability to 'reframe' difficult theological concepts for a contemporary audience. It avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by dwelling in the 'dereliction' of the cross before moving to 'deliverance.' Aesthetically, it functions as a 'witness' (Long) and a 'performance' (Immink) of the Passion narrative. While it could benefit from more sensory imagery and a more 'open' structure that allows for multiple interpretations, it is a highly effective piece of homiletical craftsmanship that respects both the text and the hearer.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Intellectual and linguistic precision in deconstructing 'stale' theological terms.",
      "Authentic reframing of 'sin' as the universal fear of abandonment.",
      "Total absence of religious kitsch or cheap sentimentality."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase sensory 'showing' to complement the strong psychological 'telling.'",
      "Allow for more 'openness' and mystery in the theological resolution.",
      "Vary the rhetorical rhythm to avoid a slightly academic/didactic tone in the middle section."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Liturgical / Reframing",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Anti-Kitsch) and Thomas Long (Preacher as Witness).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to an educated, perhaps 'spiritually weary' congregation that values intellectual honesty and liturgical tradition over emotional manipulation.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more narrative 'first-person' perspective for one of the biblical characters.",
      "Use physical objects or more concrete metaphors to ground the abstract concepts.",
      "End with a lingering question rather than a definitive 'Amen' to increase 'openness.'"
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust 'event' that succeeds in making the 'Holy happen' by refusing to look away from the darkness of the Passion. It is a model of how to handle 'difficult' texts with grace and precision. Its score reflects its excellence in language and integration, while noting room for growth in sensory vividness and structural openness."
