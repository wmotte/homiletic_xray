    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and game-free. It avoids the common homiletical trap of using the 'Critical Parent' to demand obedience. Instead, it uses the 'Adult' ego state to redefine obedience as a proactive, autonomous choice that leads to freedom. By humanizing biblical figures (Paul and Peter) and de-romanticizing the Amish, the preacher prevents the listener from falling into a 'Victim' or 'Adapted Child' role of inferiority.",
    "strengths": [

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'we' pronoun to include yourself in the human struggle, as this maintains the Adult-Adult level and prevents the 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' game."
