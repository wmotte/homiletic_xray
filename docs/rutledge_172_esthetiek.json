    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The imagery is exceptionally strong and sensory, adhering to Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don’t tell' principle. The preacher utilizes the Johannine motif of darkness not as a mere metaphor, but as a visceral reality. The description of the burial—the 'cold clasp of death' and the 'stench' implied by the spices—grounds the theological concept of the resurrection in the harsh reality of the grave. The use of the 'dust' metaphor in the Job section is particularly effective, linking Ash Wednesday to Easter in a way that is both tactile and existential. The imagery of the 'little patent-leather Easter shoes' in the ruins of a tornado provides a devastatingly concrete image of the 'night' the preacher describes, moving the sermon from abstract theology to lived experience.",
      "quotes": [
        "The dead must cross over the black waters of the river Styx into the kingdom of darkness.",
        "These little comforts are the best that we can do... walking on a beach, sitting by a grave.",

      "strengths": [
        "Vivid use of light/darkness motifs that mirror the Johannine text.",
        "Concrete, heartbreaking imagery used to illustrate the 'power of darkness'.",
        "Sensory grounding of the resurrection (linen cloths, wounds, dust)."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The Greek mythology reference (Styx) might feel slightly academic for some audiences.",
        "Could further develop the sensory experience of the 'whirlwind' in the Job section.",
        "The 'light' imagery is slightly less developed than the 'darkness' imagery."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strongly weighted toward 'showing'. The preacher allows the images of the empty tomb and the tornado ruins to carry the emotional weight before providing the theological 'tell'."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise and avoids the 'Canaanite' jargon often found in Easter sermons. There is a clear 'stewardship of language' as McEntyre describes; words like 'portentously', 'obliterated', and 'domesticated household pet' are chosen for their specific impact. The preacher distinguishes between 'sentiment' and 'authentic emotion' by refusing to use clichéd religious comfort. The precision in describing the burial customs and the legalistic 'proof' Thomas seeks shows a high level of intellectual care. However, the transition between the three segments (if read as one) occasionally relies on repetitive theological framing.",
      "quotes": [
        "The kind of doubt that is on view today... is not trendy disaffection.",
        "Our God is a God who permits us to doubt... rather than a domesticated household pet.",
        "The sum of his passionate outcries is a demand that God respond to him."

        "Occasional repetition of the 'night' motif could be tightened.",
        "The transition between the Job and Thomas sections is a bit abrupt.",
        "Some theological terms like 'incarnate Word' could be more simply unpacked for a secular hearer."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Religious jargon is minimal and, where used (e.g., 'Messiah', 'Resurrection'), it is contextualized within the narrative rather than used as a shorthand for thought."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a rhythmic cadence, particularly in the use of repetition for emphasis ('It was night', 'Why? Why? Why?'). The variation in sentence length—moving from long, descriptive passages to short, staccato declarations—creates a natural 'flow' that suggests this was written for oral delivery. The use of liturgical responses at the end of the first section ('Alleluia! Christ is risen!') provides a rhythmic climax. There is a 'legato' quality to the reflections on grief and a 'staccato' urgency in the descriptions of the disciples running to the tomb.",
      "quotes": [
        "It was night. This is the night in which Sin and Death reign.",
        "Ashes to ashes. Dust we are, and to dust we return.",
        "He arose from the kingdom of Death and carried away its spoils."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of repetition to build emotional and theological tension.",
        "Good variation between narrative description and punchy proclamation.",
        "The text 'breathes' well, with natural pauses for reflection."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The Job section is slightly more 'prose-heavy' and less rhythmic than the Easter Day section.",
        "Some of the longer theological explanations in the Thomas section disrupt the oral rhythm.",
        "Could use more alliteration or assonance to make key phrases more 'sticky'."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Primarily oral language. The sentence structures are designed for the ear, though the theological depth suggests a highly literate audience."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by a 'sober beauty.' The preacher avoids the 'kitsch' of flowery Easter language in favor of a stark, almost cinematic realism. The imagery of darkness is not just a backdrop but a character in the drama. The language is precise, hitting the 'core' of human experience—grief, doubt, and dust—before introducing the 'reframing' of the resurrection. It is a high-quality example of 'stewardship of language' where every word serves the movement from the tomb to the light."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows what Eugene Lowry calls a 'homiletical plot.' It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium'—reminding the hearer that the resurrection happened 'while it was still dark.' The arc moves from the 'obliteration of hope' to the 'inconceivable' event. Each segment (Easter, Thomas, Job) has its own internal tension: the silence of the grave, the demand for proof, and the demand for an answer. The turning points are not cheap resolutions but 'revelations' that shift the perspective. The energy is sustained by refusing to give the 'answer' too early, keeping the hearer in the 'night' until the very end of each section.",
      "quotes": [
        "The liturgy of Holy Week is designed to show that as Jesus dies, every human hope is obliterated.",
        "Thomas stands for all of us here. We haven’t seen the risen Lord... We would like proof.",
        "God’s answer is no answer at all, and yet... Job seems more than satisfied."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong 'upsetting' of the Easter 'happy ending' by starting in the dark.",
        "Clear movement from human 'why' to the divine 'Who'.",
        "Maintains tension by acknowledging the 'inconceivable' nature of the gospel."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition between the three Sundays is missing if viewed as a single text.",
        "The conclusion of the Thomas section is a bit more 'didactic' than the narrative opening.",
        "The Job section could have a more dramatic 'climax' when the whirlwind speaks."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey. It moves from the 'tomb of hope' to a 'domain beyond the grave' without skipping the necessary pain of the middle."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a masterclass in Cilliers' 'reframing.' The preacher takes the ancient texts and frames them within the modern experience of tragedy (the Alabama tornado) and existential dread (the 'cold clasp of death'). The integration is organic; the tornado story isn't just an 'illustration' but a contemporary 'night' that mirrors the darkness of John 20. The 'strangeness' of the text is respected—the preacher admits the resurrection is 'inconceivable' and that God's answer to Job is 'no answer at all.' This honesty creates a bridge between the biblical world and the skeptical modern hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "You will come to know the cold clasp of death... in a hundred other ways, as the death of a friendship, the death of a career.",
        "We can choose a god who suits us... This god will have no nail prints in his hands.",
        "You don’t have to reject evolutionary science to understand the symbolic meaning of this."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of the resurrection as a victory in the middle of the night.",
        "Honest engagement with modern suffering (tornado, loss of career).",
        "Respect for the 'otherness' of God (the 'baffling, even infuriating God')."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'evolutionary science' mention is a bit of a 'drive-by' comment that could be integrated more deeply or left out.",
        "Could explore the 'context' of the modern 'church' more—how do we live as 'Easter people' in a 'Good Friday world'?",
        "The 'Greek mythology' context might be a bit distant for a contemporary application."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes. It reframes the 'empty tomb' not as a 'happy ending' but as a 'victory in the kingdom of darkness' that changes how we view our own 'nights'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward the 'open work of art' by refusing to provide 'soothing explanations.' By stating that God's answer to Job is 'no answer at all,' the preacher leaves room for the mystery and the 'ambivalence of existence.' However, the frequent use of 'we must' or 'let our answer be' in the first segment slightly closes the space toward a more traditional Reformed 'sealed' conclusion. The Thomas section is particularly open, acknowledging that we are all 'believers and doubters.' The preacher treats the hearer as a mature partner in the struggle of faith.",
      "quotes": [
        "The divine answer does not come in the form of a 'why.' It comes in the form of a 'Who.'",
        "I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me.",
        "Do you believe this? Let our answer be hers."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the 'infuriating' nature of God, leaving room for struggle.",
        "Ends with the 'mystery' of the resurrection rather than a moral checklist.",
        "Validates doubt as a component of faith."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The first prayer/conclusion is quite 'closed' and traditional compared to the body of the sermon.",
        "The 'Yes, Lord; I believe' section feels a bit forced upon the hearer.",
        "Could leave more 'open questions' at the very end of the Job section."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly open. It respects the 'polyvalence' of suffering and the 'mystery' of God, though it remains firmly anchored in a specific Christological 'answer'."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.67,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are defined by a strong narrative arc that respects the 'darkness' of the human condition. The structure is not a static three-point sermon but a movement from despair to a 'baffling' hope. The integration of contemporary tragedy with the biblical narrative is seamless, providing a 'reframing' that is both intellectually honest and spiritually profound. It avoids the 'happy ending' kitsch by sustaining the tension of the 'not yet' and the 'why,' ultimately pointing to a 'Who' that transcends human explanation."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is a powerful antidote to religious kitsch. It explicitly rejects 'pious platitudes' and 'soothing explanations.' The preacher refuses to 'beautify' the resurrection, insisting it happened 'at night' and was 'inconceivable.' By including the raw, unedited cries of the tornado victims, the sermon honors authentic emotion over religious sentimentality. There is no 'cheap grace' here; the comfort offered is the 'cold comfort' of being dust, which paradoxically provides a deeper, more authentic aesthetic depth than any 'happy ending' could.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential kitsch of 'Jesus is the light' is avoided by grounding it in the 'stench' of the tomb.",
      "The 'happy ending' of Job is avoided by noting that God never actually answers Job's 'why'."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The man looking at the 'little patent-leather Easter shoes' in the ruins.",
      "The friend who wanted a small portion of his daughter's ashes to 'be with her'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'tragic realism' as it is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. Continue to avoid 'domesticating' the gospel message."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened by the preacher’s insistence on the 'otherness' of God. By moving away from a 'domesticated household pet' god to a 'baffling, even infuriating God,' the sermon creates a 'space for grace' that is not dependent on human understanding or moral effort. The 'space' is the 'between'—between the dust and the resurrection, between the 'why' and the 'Who.' Grace is presented as an 'unavailable' gift that comes from 'a domain beyond the grave.'",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are masterfully sustained. The 'why' of suffering is left hanging, and the 'doubt' of Thomas is left as a permanent feature of faith.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the resurrection and the whirlwind are respected as 'too wonderful' for human knowledge.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. There is almost no moralization; the focus is entirely on the 'Who' of God and the 'event' of His revelation.",
    "recommendation": "To create even more space, the preacher could occasionally use more 'invitational' language rather than 'declarative' language in the conclusions."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.8,
    "summary": "This sermon series represents a high level of homiletic aesthetics, particularly within the 'aesthetic turn' that values form as content. The preacher avoids the 'vertical' dogmatism of the past while also shunning the 'horizontal' sentimentality of modern kitsch. Instead, the sermon exists in the 'inter-esse'—the space between the reality of death and the promise of life. The poetics are 'sober-Reformed,' finding beauty in the 'dust' and the 'linen cloths.' The dramaturgy is narrative and cinematic, 'showing' the darkness of the tomb and the ruins of the tornado before 'reframing' them in the light of a God who is 'really God.' The sermon functions as an 'open work of art' by validating the hearer's doubt and pain, inviting them into a mystery that is 'too wonderful' to be fully explained. It is a profound example of how 'stewardship of language' can create a 'space for grace' in a culture of easy answers.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Anti-kitsch realism: Refusal to offer cheap comfort in the face of tragedy.",
      "Strong imagery: The 'night' and 'dust' motifs are viscerally developed.",
      "Reframing: Successfully connects the 'inconceivable' resurrection to modern existential 'nights'."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Conclusion closure: Some endings lean toward traditional 'sealed' dogmatism.",
      "Rhythmic consistency: The Job section is slightly more academic/prosaic than the Easter section.",
      "Academic distance: Occasional references (Styx, evolutionary science) may create a slight barrier for some hearers."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Poetic-Imagistic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing, Space for Grace, Anti-kitsch) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery, Show don't tell).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'mature' hearers who are weary of religious clichés and are looking for an intellectually honest, narratively rich engagement with faith and suffering.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'open endings' that leave the hearer in the 'whirlwind' of the text.",
      "Further develop the 'musicality' of the prose in the more didactic sections.",
      "Continue to use 'secular' imagery (like the tornado) to 'reframe' biblical truths."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically strong 'event' that honors the 'holy' by refusing to domesticate it. It achieves a rare balance between the 'trouble' of human existence and the 'grace' of God's action. Through careful language and a dynamic narrative arc, it opens a space where the hearer can encounter the 'baffling' God of the resurrection. It is a model of how to preach Easter without falling into the trap of religious kitsch."
