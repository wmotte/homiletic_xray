    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "While the preacher identifies Revelation 22 as the text, the sermon quickly devolves into a personal retrospective. The 'specificity' Dekker demands—finding what is NOWHERE else—is lost as the preacher uses the text merely as a springboard for a farewell address. The text is treated as a 'biblical idea' of closure rather than a unique proclamatory word.",
      "quotes": [
        "How strange that after two years in the Book of Revelation... we would come on this last Sunday to the last part of the last chapter"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus strictly on the unique nature of the 'seal' of the canon in Revelation 22. What does this specific warning against 'adding or taking away' say that the rest of the Bible does not? Avoid the biographical detour."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of the 'bicycle mechanic's' skill here. No mention of the Greek context, the apocalyptic genre, or the specific situation of the seven churches to whom this warning was addressed. The exegesis is replaced by personal anecdotes about the preacher's family and career.",
      "quotes": [
        "This final scene in the book sounds a note of the utmost gravity... Whichever, the commandment has a note of stern warning to it."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the historical-critical reality of the Johannine community. Explain why a first-century author would use such a 'canon formula' to protect the integrity of a visionary text."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the preacher's own life and the American political context (Constitution, South Africa), which Dekker values. However, it becomes 'general truth' when applying to the congregation, falling into sentimentalism rather than sharp spiritual diagnosis.",
      "quotes": [
        "The original Constitution of the United States identified you and me as three-fifths of a citizen.",
        "I leave to any who are sad the ancient promise..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move away from the 'legacy' format. Apply the warning of Revelation 22 to the specific ways the modern congregation 'takes away' from the Word through apathy or cultural accommodation."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is fragmented. It begins with a long personal introduction, moves briefly to the text, and ends with a litany of blessings. The 'movement' where the hearer is drawn into the text is absent; the text is used to validate the preacher's departure.",
      "quotes": [
        "I lay my record at your feet... How strange that after two years... we would come on this last Sunday to the last part"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Structure the sermon so that the gravity of the biblical warning (exposition) immediately 'expounds' the current state of the church (application) simultaneously."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The categories are present in the background. Misery is seen in the 'shudder' before the Word and the 'perishing prizes' of the world. Redemption is Christ-centered, and gratitude is expressed through the 'legacy' of grace. However, it leans heavily toward the preacher's subjective experience.",
      "quotes": [
        "I shudder when I read these words.",
        "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by addressing the congregational 'loss' in time, rather than just the preacher's personal humility."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is a stronger point. The preacher explicitly mentions the 'judgment' and the 'plagues,' taking the possibility of being lost seriously. He contrasts the 'broad way' of secular acclaim with the 'narrow way' of divine communion.",
      "quotes": [
        "God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book",
        "No one who takes God and his truth seriously can long enjoy this world's applause."

      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'two ways' are tied to the specific text's warning about the 'Book of Life' rather than general ministerial success."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, especially in the conclusion. The preacher correctly identifies grace as the final word. However, Christ is often presented as a 'helper' for the preacher's satisfaction rather than the objective Lord of the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "I shall be forever satisfied if that soul says, 'I came to Jesus...'",
        "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all."

      "improvement_point": "Focus on Christ as the 'Alpha and Omega' of the specific text, rather than Christ as the validator of the preacher's 42-year career."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1450 words, the sermon likely lasts 14-15 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for 'depth.' The brevity contributes to the lack of exegetical rigor.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section (Thesis 2) to reach the 20-minute threshold, allowing the text to breathe before the personal farewell."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily because it is a 'farewell speech' first and an 'exposition of a specific Bible passage' second. It lacks the technical exegetical depth (Hebrew/Greek/Context) and the necessary length (under 20 minutes) to achieve substantive weight. While it effectively addresses the 'two ways' and the seriousness of God's Word, the text is frequently overshadowed by the preacher's biography.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong sense of the 'two ways' and the ultimate seriousness of human life before God.",
      "Concrete application to social and political realities (US Constitution, South Africa).",
      "Clear Christocentric focus in the closing benedictions."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (approx. 15 minutes) prevents the 'breadth' Dekker requires.",
      "Lack of specific exegesis; the preacher admits to only 'skimming the surface.'",
      "The sermon is too 'human-oriented' toward the preacher himself rather than the 'three parts' of the congregation's spiritual state."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate occasional address, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict sense of Dekker’s theses. It lacks the formal rigor of exposition and the required duration to properly actualize the Word of God."
