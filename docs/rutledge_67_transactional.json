By operating from the Adult ego state, the preacher validates the listener's reality (the experience of pain and God's absence) rather than using the Critical Parent to shame doubt. It avoids the 'Drama Triangle' by refusing to play the Rescuer with easy answers, instead inviting the listener into a mature, autonomous 'stubbornness' of faith.",
