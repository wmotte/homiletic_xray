  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This is a psychologically robust sermon that prioritizes Adult-to-Adult communication. By sharing her own ethical dilemmas and historical research, the preacher avoids the 'Critical Parent' trap common in Decalogue sermons. While it carries a strong political charge, it does so transparently, allowing the listener to disagree or reflect without being shamed into submission. The primary psychological risk is a collective 'Ain't It Awful' regarding the state of the world, which can lead to passivity.",
    "strengths": [
      "High transparency regarding personal ethical struggles.",
      "Strong Adult-Adult address that respects the listener's intellect.",
      "Rejection of 'Consensus' (Adapted Child) in favor of integrity."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Could integrate more 'Free Child' elements (hope, vision) to balance the heavy 'Ain't It Awful' atmosphere.",
      "Risk of creating an 'Us vs. Them' dynamic through the Persecutor role assigned to political figures."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue practicing 'Self-Disclosure' of uncertainty. To avoid the Drama Triangle, ensure the 'Rescuer' impulse for the poor leads to concrete Adult empowerment rather than just shared indignation."
