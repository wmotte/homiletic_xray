  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and promotes autonomy. By framing 'righteousness' as 'adulthood,' the preacher moves the religious experience out of the Parent-Child dynamic (Law/Obedience) and into the Adult-Adult dynamic (Responsibility/Reality-testing). The preacher’s self-disclosure of his own resistance to the text prevents a 'holier-than-thou' game. The only psychological risk is a subtle 'No-Win' situation where 'Adult' is defined so heroically that the listener's 'Free Child' needs (rest, play, self-care) might be labeled as 'wicked' narcissism.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong appeal to the Adult ego state.",
      "Rejection of the 'Adapted Child' moralism.",
      "High level of transparency and self-awareness."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Could incorporate more 'Free Child' elements to balance the heavy 'Adult' responsibility.",
      "The definition of 'wicked' as 'not noticing' is a Parent-state judgment that could be softened."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements regarding the struggle with the text. Ensure that the 'Free Child' (joy, spontaneity) is celebrated as part of being 'truly human' so that 'Adulthood' doesn't become a new, heavy 'Critical Parent' requirement."
