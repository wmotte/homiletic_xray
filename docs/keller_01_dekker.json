    "sermon_start_end": "The Bible says, in Ephesians 2, when we unite with Jesus Christ, his resurrection power comes into our lives. It says we have been raised with Christ already. It’s a spiritual resurrection. In Philippians 3, Paul says, “I want to know him and the power of his resurrection.” [...] That’s how you’re going to heal your heart of the existential spirit we have until we rest our hopes in the living hope, in the imperishable hope. Keep looking at the gospel. Look at it over and over again. That will heal your heart. Let’s pray."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon follows the structure of the pericope ('marching through the text'). However, it frequently drifts into general biblical concepts (Ephesians, Philippians, Titus) rather than mining the unique particularity of 1 Peter. The 'nowhere else' quality is weakened by harmonizing Peter with Paul and John.",
      "quotes": [
        "What is the new birth? ... You have to go to John, James, and a lot of other places",
        "Paul says in the book of Titus when we’re born again, we experience regeneration"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more on the specific Petrine vocabulary of 'living hope' and 'inheritance' as distinct from Pauline 'justification' or Johannine 'new birth' to find the unique angle of this specific text."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher uses Greek terminology (palingenesia), but the historical-religious context of the first readers (exiles in Asia Minor) is entirely absent. The exegesis is more lexical and dogmatic than historical.",
      "quotes": [
        "I’m going to do a little Greek on you. There’s a word in the Bible (palingenesia).",
        "Peter is writing to a church. He doesn’t say, 'Praise be to the God and Father...'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the socio-historical reality of the 'resident aliens' to whom Peter wrote. Exposition must answer what the text meant for *those* specific first readers before moving to New Yorkers."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is psychologically astute and culturally relevant, specifically addressing the 'New York' mindset and the 'portfolio' of modern hopes. It avoids vague moralism by focusing on the 'zeitgeist' of career and family as idols.",
      "quotes": [
        "People today, especially in New York … I’ve talked to people who say, 'Oh, yes. I understand born-again Christianity.'",
        "There’s career and money and accomplishment and status. That’s one cluster. Another cluster is love, romance..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "While the psychological application is strong, the sermon could benefit from more concrete 'collective' or 'political' applications as Dekker suggests, rather than focusing almost exclusively on individual interiority."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon avoids the 'block' structure. Application is woven into the four-point 'march' through the text. The hearer is 'expounded' alongside the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "The reason the new birth changes you so much is it changes your hopes, and if you change your hopes you change everything. Look here. It says..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the transition from the Greek 'palingenesia' to the 'two people in a room' illustration feels less like a lecture and more like a single movement of revelation."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "The triad of misery (perishable hopes/suffering), redemption (Christ's perishing), and gratitude (living hope/rejoicing) is the backbone of the sermon. It is deeply human-oriented without losing its Trinitarian grounding.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you build your life on anything more than God, suffering can only destroy you.",
        "Your hope, my hope is imperishable because Jesus Christ perished."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The 'gratitude' section could be more explicitly linked to 'good works' or the 'calling' of the Christian in the world, rather than just internal 'buoyancy'."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are present in the contrast between perishable and imperishable hopes. The seriousness of 'being destroyed' by suffering if one's hope is misplaced serves as a temporal 'being lost'. However, the eternal dimension is softened.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you build your life on anything but God, suffering will just destroy your life.",
        "Every tree in this world is coming down."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address more sharply the 'ultimate possibilities' of the life design. The warning about 'perishing' should carry more weight than just psychological distress."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon moves toward the substitutionary work of Christ as the only ground for the 'imperishable' nature of the hope. The 'one Lord' is central.",
      "quotes": [
        "Your hope is imperishable because Jesus Christ perished. He came and took the punishment we deserve."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly link the 'two natures' of Christ to the 'palingenesia' to show why only the God-man can bridge the cosmic and the personal."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "At approximately 24 minutes, the sermon meets Dekker's minimum requirement for 'breadth'. It allows for multiple illustrations and theological development.",
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this length but reduce the number of external Bible references to allow for deeper 'boring' into the specific 1 Peter text."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of psychological-theological preaching that takes the human subject seriously. It falls short primarily in its lack of historical-critical exposition (original context) and a tendency to harmonize the specific voice of Peter into a general 'biblical' message. It succeeds in making the 'misery' of misplaced hope concrete and pointing to Christ as the only 'imperishable' telos.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' (misery, redemption, gratitude) as a background framework.",
      "Concrete and culturally relevant application to the 'zeitgeist' of modern success and identity.",
      "Strong Christocentric conclusion that grounds hope in the objective work of Christ."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specific historical exposition regarding the first readers' context (the 'diaspora' of Asia Minor).",
      "Over-reliance on other biblical books (John, Titus, Ephesians) at the expense of 1 Peter's unique voice.",
      "The 'two ways' are framed primarily as psychological outcomes rather than ultimate theological destinies."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is a 'recreation' of the Word into a current word, though it leans more heavily on 'application' than 'exposition'. It avoids general truths by being psychologically concrete."
