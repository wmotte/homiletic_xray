    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on a single specific passage. While Psalm 148 is the title, the majority of the text is an exposition of Acts 11. It treats the Bible as a collection of themes (interruption, inclusion) rather than recreating a specific pericope into a new word. It lacks the specificity of what can be found 'nowhere else' in Psalm 148.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Psalm for today, Psalm 148, is an astonishing hymn of praise...",
        "So it was with Peter... He says, In a trance I saw a vision. (Acts 11:5)"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select either Acts 11 or Psalm 148. If Psalm 148, focus on the unique cosmic hierarchy of praise rather than using it as a late-sermon illustration for social inclusion."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Exegesis is largely psychological and sociological. The preacher mentions Leviticus and the 'Book of Acts' context, but there is no evidence of Hebrew/Greek study or engagement with the specific theology of the biblical books. The 'original context' is reduced to a general conflict between 'clean and unclean'.",
      "quotes": [
        "She had taught him about clean and unclean from the book of Leviticus...",
        "The Jewish distinctions are social and religious; the Roman distinctions are political and economic."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exegetical work on the specific cultic meaning of 'koinos' (profane) in Acts or the specific structure of the 'hallel' in Psalm 148."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Application is the strongest point, identifying specific contemporary 'zeitgeist' issues (race, gender, immigration). However, it borders on 'general truths' of liberal progressivism rather than application derived strictly from the text's unique voice.",
      "quotes": [
        "We thought we had the gay thing settled... but we were interrupted when they refused to stay hidden",
        "Now we are interrupted about immigrants and are pondering what the distinction might be between citizens and undocumented workers"

      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application is not just a list of current social debates but is 'expounded' directly from the specific mechanics of the text."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon moves back and forth between Peter's story and modern social issues. While not a strict 'block' structure, the transitions are thematic rather than a single movement where the hearer is 'expounded' by the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "So there is a nighttime trance and a daytime implementation of the dream... That of course is what Jesus does. He challenges the Roman Empire..."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is defined as 'preoccupation with ourselves' and 'exclusion'. Redemption is 'inclusion'. This is a horizontal, psychological interpretation. The vertical dimension of misery (sin before God) and redemption (justification of the ungodly) is thin.",
      "quotes": [
        "It produces anxiety that in turn sometimes generates violence.",
        "God has given ... to Gentiles [the unclean ones] the repentance that leads to life."
      ],

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are present only in the sense of 'old codes' vs 'new reality'. The seriousness of being 'lost' is framed as 'being lost in time' (social failure) rather than the ultimate destination of man. It lacks the 'sharpness' Dekker requires regarding the narrow way.",
      "quotes": [
        "The bad are slotted into failure, poverty, food stamps, and despair.",
        "Such an embrace... is the way to newness... and new life for us."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, but he is portrayed primarily as an 'interrupter' and a social boundary-crosser. The doctrine of the two natures is not evident. Grace is present as 'expansive love' but leans toward a general principle of inclusion.",
      "quotes": [
        "Because of this Jesus who interrupts, here we are...",
        "Jesus gives a new commandment of love that reaches beyond our own kind"

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1350 words, the sermon lasts about 13-14 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for 'depth'. It is too short to properly expound both Acts 11 and Psalm 148.",
      "improvement_point": "Increase the substantive length to at least 20 minutes by deepening the exegetical and dogmatic background."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily due to its lack of focus on a single specific Bible passage and its insufficient length. It functions more as a thematic speech on 'inclusion' using various biblical motifs than as an actualization of a specific Word of God. The exegesis is secondary to a sociological analysis of the zeitgeist.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application to contemporary social issues (race, gender, immigration).",
      "Clear thematic thread ('interruption') that attempts to link the biblical narrative to modern experience.",
      "Avoids overly 'objective' preaching by focusing on the human subject's anxiety and change."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Fails the 20-minute minimum requirement for depth.",
      "Blurring of multiple texts (Acts, Psalm 148, John) prevents the 'specific' word of one passage from emerging.",
      "Theological categories (misery, redemption) are horizontal/social rather than vertical/Trinitarian."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the strict sense of Dekker's definition. It is a thematic address that uses biblical characters as illustrations for a general truth about social progress and inclusion, rather than an exposition and application of a specific pericope."
