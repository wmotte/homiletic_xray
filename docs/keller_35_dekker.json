  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Acts 17 as a framework, but it functions more as a springboard for a topical discussion on 'belief' and 'worldviews' rather than extracting what can be found NOWHERE else in this text. It treats the passage as a model for apologetics rather than a unique revelation.",
      "quotes": [
        "One of the ways to answer that question is to go to Acts, chapter 17",
        "There are many more things in here than I’m going to tell you. It’s rather top level"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the unique tension in the Areopagus speech—the specific intersection of Greek philosophy and Jewish eschatology—rather than using it as a generic template for 'how to talk to New Yorkers'."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates familiarity with the Greek (dialegomai) and the historical context of the Agora and the philosophical schools (Stoics/Epicureans). The exegesis is traceable and grounded in the history of the biblical books.",
      "quotes": [
        "It was actually the place where all of the ideas were debated.",
        "That word reason is really interesting. It’s the Greek word dialegomai, and it has a very specific meaning."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exegesis of the 'unknown god' beyond a psychological 'intuition' to the actual religious-historical practice in Athens to avoid modernizing the text too quickly."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "The application is highly concrete, addressing the specific 'zeitgeist' of secular New York. It engages with cultural philosophy (Anscombe), sociology, and current media (NYT, Wall Street Journal). It avoids generalities by confronting specific secular dilemmas.",
      "quotes": [
        "I believe if Paul were here he would say exactly the same thing to New Yorkers.",
        "There was an article in the New York Times recently about a think tank."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application remains tied to the *text's* specific logic of judgment and resurrection rather than drifting into a general lecture on moral philosophy."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a somewhat 'layered' approach. While it attempts to move between the text and the hearer, it often feels like a lecture on worldviews where the text is the illustration, rather than the hearer being 'expounded' by the text itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "Here are the three things I’d like you to get from this passage.",
        "Let me give you an example, and then let me give you a philosopher who explains it."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the 'three points' structure which separates the biblical narrative from the contemporary analysis; let the text’s own movement dictate the sermon's flow."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Misery is presented as the 'incoherence' of secular life and the inability to face suffering. Redemption is the resurrection. Gratitude is 'fearless love.' However, the 'misery' feels more like an intellectual deficit than a theological state before God.",
      "quotes": [
        "Your worldview is too small for your own moral intuitions.",
        "He didn’t disdain us. He came down. He got involved."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Sharpen the 'misery' aspect. The secular person is not just 'incoherent' but, according to the text, 'ignorant' and called to 'repent' before a coming judgment."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon mentions judgment and the 'extinction' of old gods, but it softens the 'two ways.' The choice is presented more as a fulfillment of desires than a matter of being 'lost' in the sense Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "He has set a day when he will judge the world with justice",
        "Do you have a heart-shaped hope wonderful enough salvation for your heart’s deepest desires?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the reality of being 'lost in time' or 'eternity' more directly, as the text concludes with some sneering and others believing—a clear division of paths."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, specifically through the resurrection. The sermon correctly identifies the 'two natures' (God coming down) and points to salvation outside the self. Grace is the answer to the failure of the 'Stoic' or 'Epicurean' self-reliance.",
      "quotes": [
        "The one Lord who is central in the sermon is Christ.",
        "He didn’t detach from us. He attached to us."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect Christ more strictly to the 'Man he has appointed' in verse 31 to emphasize the necessity of the Mediator in the face of judgment."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At an estimated 32 minutes, the sermon provides the 'breadth' Miskotte and Dekker require for 'depth.' It takes the time to engage with complex ideas.",
      "quotes": [
        "(Estimated word count: 3200)"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "None required for length; ensure the breadth continues to serve the specific text rather than external philosophical debates."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily in its tendency to treat the Bible passage as a template for a worldview lecture rather than a unique, proclamatory Word. It excels in contemporary application and cultural analysis but risks letting 'dogma and psychology' (or in this case, apologetics and philosophy) stay too awake during the sermon, rather than letting the text speak its own unique word. The 'misery' is somewhat intellectualized.",
    "strengths": [
      "Adequate length allows for substantive engagement with the zeitgeist.",
      "Strong use of humanities (philosophy/sociology) to make the application concrete.",
      "Clear Christocentric telos focused on the resurrection."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The specific 'uniqueness' of the Acts 17 text is secondary to the preacher's apologetic goals.",
      "The 'two ways' lack the sharp edge of potential 'loss' that Dekker emphasizes.",
      "Structure leans toward a topical lecture rather than an integrated exposition-application movement."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a traceable and strong piece of homiletical work that qualifies as a sermon under Dekker's definition, though it leans heavily toward 'teaching' (didache) rather than 'proclamation' (kerygma). It satisfies the formal requirements but requires more 'specific' biblical focus to reach the ideal."
