    "risk_explanation": "The only slight risk is a 'Bait & Switch' where the beauty of God (Ps 111) is used to sneak in political demands (Ps 112), but the preacher is transparent about this connection."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and promotes high levels of autonomy. By utilizing an Adult-Adult transaction style, the preacher avoids the common trap of using the pulpit to shame (Critical Parent) or foster dependency (Smothering Nurturing Parent). The sermon identifies external systemic 'games' (the culture of fear) and provides the listener with the psychological tools (firm heart, security in the Lord) to opt-out. It successfully bridges theological reflection with psychological health by equating 'faith' with 'freedom from anxiety'.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The critique of 'US religion' could lean toward Critical Parent if expanded.",
      "The 'Happy' ending is slightly repetitive, bordering on a 'Child' plea for validation."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'Imagine' and 'Consider' as these are the hallmarks of Adult-to-Adult invitations that respect the listener's boundaries."
