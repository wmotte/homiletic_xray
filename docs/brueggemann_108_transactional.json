    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative games. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, inviting the listener into a reality-testing exercise that acknowledges pain without succumbing to it. By avoiding the 'Bait & Switch' of easy grace followed by harsh law, it maintains a consistent message of 'tough truth-telling' and 'defiant hope.' The preacher empowers the listener's autonomy by framing faith as a 'resolve' and a 'vocation' rather than a passive submission.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The critique of 'white males' could trigger a defensive 'Adapted Child' response in some listeners, potentially crossing the transaction.",
      "Could further invite the 'Free Child' by expanding on the 'spacious place' imagery."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'we' inclusive language and the three-step analytical framework (Remember, Tell Truth, Defy), as this reinforces the Adult ego state in the listener."
