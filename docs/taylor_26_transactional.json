    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of 'Guilt-Homiletics.' While theologically orthodox in its focus on the Passion, it psychologically functions by overwhelming the listener's Adult ego with Critical Parent accusations. By equating modern 'boredom' with the literal crucifixion of Christ, it creates an impossible standard that fosters a shame-based 'Adapted Child' response rather than an 'Adult' decision to follow.",

      "Direct linkage of minor human foibles (boredom, slinking from difficulty) to deicide."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to maintain the Adult-Adult transaction when moving into application. Instead of 'You help to crucify him,' try 'How do we, as people today, relate to the pressure of the crowd?' This invites reflection rather than defensive adaptation."
