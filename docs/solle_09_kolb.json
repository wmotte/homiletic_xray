    "sermon_start_end": "»Das Licht, das in dir ist …«, lese ich, ein schöner mystischer Ausdruck. Die Mystiker haben immer wieder vom »Licht in uns« gesprochen. Der ganze Text der Verse 22 und 23 setzt voraus, dass »Licht in uns« ist, ja unser ganzer Leib »voll Licht« sein kann. [...] Das Licht, das in uns ist, das Licht dessen, der alles geschaffen hat: Wir sind beteiligt daran, eine neue Erde zu schaffen.",
    "notes": "The sermon is heavily influenced by political theology and the peace movement context of the early 1980s."

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon lacks a narrative 'hook' or a personal story to ground the hearer. It begins with a mystical concept rather than a concrete life situation. While it mentions 'oil crisis' and 'inflation', these are treated as categories rather than lived experiences. The emotional connection is primarily driven by indignation rather than empathy or identification with biblical characters.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ölkrise, Inflation, Zwangsräumung bedrohen gerade die kleinen Profiteure des Systems",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher pauses to explore the human condition of 'having' versus 'being'. There is a clear cultural critique and an attempt to look at the problem of greed from a systemic perspective. The sermon asks 'why' we don't see the truth and identifies 'repression' as a psychological barrier.",
      "quotes": [
        "Was kann das bedeuten? In welchem Sinn kann der Leib [...] Licht oder Finsternis sein?",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon offers a clear theological framework, linking mysticism with economics. The 'big idea' is the incompatibility of serving God and Capital. The exegesis is not traditional/historical-critical but rather thematic and dogmatic, providing a logical (though radical) connection between the 'eye' and the 'treasury'.",

        "The exegesis of 'Schätze im Himmel' as 'relationships' is somewhat narrow; it could benefit from more biblical-theological grounding.",
        "The transition from 'mysticism' to 'capitalism' is abrupt and could use more theoretical scaffolding."
      ],
      "homiletical_manifestations": "Manifests through dogmatic deepening, the formulation of the 'God vs. Capital' antithesis, and the definition of 'Heaven' and 'Earth' as symbols."

      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon remains largely at the level of 'prophetic call' rather than 'practical application'. While it calls for a 'new earth', it lacks specific action steps for the individual hearer. The application is systemic (stop the arms race) rather than personal or congregational. It tells the hearer *what* to think/see, but not specifically *how* to change their economic life tomorrow.",

It effectively challenges the hearer's worldview by contrasting the 'logic of capital' with the 'logic of light'. However, from a Kolb perspective, it is significantly unbalanced. It lacks a concrete, recognizable starting point in the hearer's everyday experience and fails to provide specific, actionable steps for the congregation. The sermon functions more as a theological manifesto than a holistic learning experience. It addresses the 'Assimilating' and 'Diverging' learners through its intellectual depth and visionary metaphors but leaves the 'Converging' and 'Accommodating' learners without practical handles or narrative engagement. The transition from mystical 'light' to political 'capital' is intellectually stimulating but may bypass the emotional and practical layers of the hearer's life.",

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a powerful prophetic address that succeeds in its normative and interpretive tasks but falls short in its descriptive and pragmatic functions. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'Head and Eyes' sermon that neglects the 'Heart and Hands'. It is highly effective for a specific type of hearer (the intellectual/activist) but risks alienating those who need concrete guidance or narrative connection. To improve, the preacher should focus on closing the loop of the learning cycle by moving from the visionary 'new earth' back to the concrete 'Monday morning' of the hearer."
