    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely game-free. It avoids the common 'Nurturing Parent' trap of wedding homilies that smother the couple in sentimentality. Instead, it uses the Adult ego state to provide a realistic map of marriage. While it utilizes a brief 'Critical Parent' stance to critique society, it primarily seeks to empower the couple's autonomy by linking their private relationship to a larger social and divine context. It avoids the 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' game by admitting that even the spouse will 'lack sufficiency,' thus preventing the setup of impossible expectations.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'hell in a hand basket' comment is a CP cliché that briefly breaks the Adult-Adult contract.",
      "Could incorporate more 'Free Child' joy to balance the 'demanding' Parent tone."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Holy Neighbor' as a way to deflect the Rescuer role from the preacher or the spouse, as this maintains healthy boundaries and encourages personal responsibility."
