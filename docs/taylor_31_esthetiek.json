    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating sensory environments, particularly the contrast between the 'chill clutch of death' and the 'certainty of springtime.' The preacher uses 'painting the picture' effectively, especially in the description of the crucifixion's aftermath and the hospital scene. However, some metaphors lean toward the conventional ('dark cloud', 'fields of living green'), which prevents a higher score. The imagery follows Paul Scott Wilson's 'show, don't tell' by describing the sunken eyes and quavering voice of the grieving man rather than just stating he was sad. The biblical world is evoked with visceral detail, transforming abstract theological victory into a physical reality of 'bruised and broken' flesh versus 'shining eyes.'",
      "quotes": [
        "His eyes were sunken circles of sorrow and heartbreak.",
        "Hands that had healed the sick bore now the ugly scar of a cruel spike.",
        "The bright burnished dream had ended as a horrible, bloody nightmare."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is deliberate and rhythmic, avoiding heavy dogmatic jargon in favor of 'stewardship of language' that seeks to connect with human experience. However, it suffers from a degree of mid-century 'pulpit-speak'—alliterative clusters like 'snarling, screaming, screeching' feel more performative than precise. While it avoids 'Canaanite' jargon, it replaces it with a romanticized vocabulary ('wistful dream', 'high holy crusade') that can feel slightly dated. The precision is highest in the pastoral anecdote of the hospital, where the dialogue is captured with painful accuracy. The theological nuance of the 'already/not yet' is handled with poetic care rather than systematic rigor.",
      "quotes": [
        "A snarling, screaming, screeching society of suspicion and conflict.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest aesthetic feature. It possesses a clear cadence and uses parallelism ('Jesus has been here now...') to build liturgical momentum. The variation in sentence length—moving from short, punchy declarations ('It is Easter!') to long, flowing reflections—creates a natural 'flow' suited for oral delivery. The use of anaphora in the conclusion functions like a musical crescendo. It is clearly 'oral language' rather than 'paper language,' designed to be heard and felt. The rhythm mimics the movement from the staccato of despair to the legato of hope.",
      "quotes": [
        "Laughter will be silenced, and smiles will be frozen.",
        "Jesus has been here now, and we can raise up our bowed-down heads. Jesus has been here now, and we can believe...",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon demonstrates a high level of micro-aesthetic awareness. It prioritizes the 'musicality' of the spoken word, utilizing rhetorical devices like alliteration and anaphora to create a compelling oral event. The imagery is vivid and sensory, effectively 'showing' the tragedy of death and the hope of resurrection. While the language occasionally veers into the overly romanticized or 'pulpit-heavy' style of its era, it maintains a consistent stewardship of words that honors the emotional complexity of the subject matter."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with a 'false equilibrium' (the general hope of Easter), quickly upsets it with the 'specter of death' (the hospital scene), and moves into the 'mangled despair' of the crucifixion. The turning point is the 'strange question' in the cemetery. The movement from 'Trouble' to 'Grace' (Wilson) is well-balanced. However, the transition from the philosophical problem of death to the specific narrative of Mary Magdalene is somewhat abrupt, relying on a general transition about 'stubborn love.' The tension is sustained well until the final 'Mary' moment.",
      "quotes": [
        "Is that what life is all about? Is it a bright day doomed to an everlasting night...?",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon attempts to 'reframe' (Cilliers) the cemetery from a place of finality to a place of encounter. It connects the 'now' of the grieving man in the hospital with the 'then' of Mary at the tomb. However, the integration is somewhat traditional; it uses the biblical text as an 'answer' to a contemporary 'problem' rather than letting the text and context truly interrogate each other. The 'reframing' is effective but lacks the 'estrangement' that Cilliers advocates—it confirms the Easter hope rather than making it startlingly new. The context of a 'screeching society' is mentioned but not deeply integrated into the resurrection narrative.",
      "quotes": [
        "I stood not too long ago with a man in a hospital room... Is that what life is all about?",
        "Mary's love of her Lord posted her there in the hopelessness of the cemetery.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "In Stark's terms, this sermon leans toward a 'closed' work. While it acknowledges the 'grand perhaps' and the 'great maybe,' it ultimately resolves all tensions into a triumphant, almost certain conclusion. The 'strange question' is answered definitively. There is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or the 'not yet' after the final crescendo. The hearer is led down a very specific path toward a predetermined emotional response. While comforting, it lacks the 'polyvalence' that allows a hearer to sit with their own ongoing grief or doubt within the space of the sermon.",
      "quotes": [
        "The grand 'perhaps,' the great 'maybe' that this is not all comes back in vigor and force.",
        "Jesus was there and alive, and this made that cemetery so very different. It still does.",
        "We shall meet again where the load has lifted and the gate opens wide."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the reality of ongoing weeping ('we will go on weeping').",
        "The central question 'Why weepest thou?' invites the hearer to consider their own grief.",
        "The use of 'perhaps' and 'maybe' at the start creates an initial opening."

        "Leave more room for the 'silence' of the Saturday before the Easter Sunday resolution.",
        "Avoid the 'happy ending' tropes that suggest all problems are now solved.",
        "Invite the hearer to answer the 'strange question' for themselves rather than answering for them."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "A relatively closed work; monovalent in its drive toward triumph."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon's structure is rhetorically effective and follows a classic narrative arc from despair to hope. It successfully uses the 'strange question' of the text as a pivot point. However, it suffers from a lack of 'openness,' moving too quickly to resolve existential tensions with traditional liturgical imagery. The integration of context is strong in its emotional resonance but remains somewhat superficial in its theological depth, functioning more as an illustration of a truth than a transformative encounter with the text's 'strangeness.'"

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 5,
    "analysis": "The sermon teeters on the edge of religious kitsch. Cilliers warns against 'pre-chewed emotions,' and phrases like 'fields of living green' and 'singing of angels' border on the clichéd sentimentality that avoids the 'pain of suffering.' However, the sermon is saved by its 'authentic moments'—the raw description of the hospital room and the 'bruised and broken corpse.' These moments of 'authentic depth' ground the sermon in reality. The kitsch is present in the 'happy ending' resolution which feels slightly too immediate and 'pretty' for the gravity of the 'sunken circles of sorrow' described earlier.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'wistful dream of life being stronger than death returns with the certainty of springtime.'",
      "The 'land beyond the river, a land whose fields are living green.'"

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The man in the hospital saying, 'Forty-seven years, and now I can't do anything for her.'",
      "The description of Jesus' eyes being 'fixed in the stare of death.'"
    ],
    "recommendation": "To increase depth, the preacher should avoid 'stock' religious imagery (green fields, angel songs) and instead find new, specific metaphors for hope that don't feel like 'sentimental bypass.'"
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens a 'Space for Grace' by focusing on the 'stubborn quality of love' as a precursor to God's action. It moves beyond mere moralism (it doesn't tell people to 'try harder'), focusing instead on the 'event' of Jesus being 'there.' However, the space is somewhat 'dogmatically sealed' by the end; the mystery of the resurrection is translated into a series of comforting certainties. The 'tension' between the cemetery and the life is resolved a bit too cheaply through lyrical crescendo rather than sustained theological reflection on the 'between' time.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are introduced effectively but resolved quickly and rhetorically.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery is largely explained through the lens of 'hope' and 'meeting again.'",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails over moralization; the focus is on what Christ has done/is doing.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'strangeness' of the living Christ to remain strange; don't domesticate the resurrection into a 'certainty of springtime.'"

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.3,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of mid-century rhetorical homiletics. Its primary aesthetic power lies in its musicality and its ability to evoke deep human emotion through narrative and imagery. It successfully avoids dry moralism, opting instead for a 'poetic-imagistic' delivery that seeks to move the heart. The preacher demonstrates 'stewardship of language' by crafting sentences that are meant to be felt as much as understood. However, the sermon's aesthetic quality is hampered by a tendency toward religious kitsch—using overly familiar, sentimental metaphors that can mask the radicality of the gospel. While it opens a space for grace, it closes that space too quickly with traditional liturgical 'happy endings.' It is a 'good' sermon that functions well as a comfort-piece, but it lacks the 'openness' and 'polyvalence' required for a higher aesthetic score in a contemporary context.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional oral rhythm and rhetorical cadence.",
      "Vivid, sensory imagery in the description of the crucifixion.",
      "Strong emotional resonance through the use of pastoral anecdotes."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduce reliance on sentimental, clichéd metaphors (springtime, green fields).",
      "Create more 'openness' in the conclusion to allow for the hearer's own interpretation.",
      "Deepen the 'reframing' of the contemporary 'screeching society' in light of the text."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Poetic-Imagistic / Mid-Century Rhetorical",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'New Homiletic' precursors like Paul Scott Wilson (imagery/four pages) and the narrative focus of Thomas Long.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who find comfort in traditional liturgical beauty and emotional, narrative-driven preaching.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'stark simplicity' rather than 'lyrical abundance' to avoid kitsch.",
      "Leave the central question of the text unanswered for a few moments longer to create 'inter-esse'.",
      "Use more 'earthy' metaphors for resurrection that don't rely on nature cycles."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is aesthetically effective as a piece of 'consolatio.' It uses the tools of rhetoric—rhythm, image, and narrative—to lead the hearer from the 'cemetery' of despair to the 'anthem' of hope. While it occasionally falls into the trap of 'beautifying' the message with sentimental clichés, its core remains grounded in the authentic human experience of loss. It is a well-crafted 'performance' that honors the 'event' of Easter, even if it domesticates the 'mystery' slightly for the sake of immediate comfort."
