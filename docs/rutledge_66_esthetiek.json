    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon relies heavily on the inherent imagery of the Song of Songs and Proverbs rather than generating original metaphors. It effectively 'paints' the scene of the 1970s youth ministry, creating a sensory bridge to the text. However, much of the imagery is quoted (Bede, Herbert, Davis) rather than woven into the preacher's own descriptive voice. The 'show vs. tell' balance leans toward 'telling' the meaning of the images rather than letting the images perform the work themselves. The use of 'the banner' and 'the banqueting table' is evocative but remains somewhat tied to traditional liturgical shorthand. The sensory potential of the Song of Songs (smell, taste, touch) is acknowledged intellectually but not fully exploited in the prose to create a vivid 'cinematic' experience for the listener.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and demonstrates high 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre). The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' while rehabilitating technical terms like 'epithalamium' and 'ecstasy.' There is a clear effort to define terms (e.g., the etymology of ecstasy as 'standing outside oneself'). The tone is sophisticated yet accessible, reflecting an academic-pastoral synthesis. The nuance regarding 'retroactive grace' shows a careful handling of human complexity and potential pastoral wounds. Every word feels weighed, particularly in the transition from the erotic to the theological, avoiding the sloppiness often found in discussions of sexuality.",
      "quotes": [
        "Its literal meaning is 'to stand outside oneself.'",
        "the grace of God is retroactive",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a dignified, rhythmic cadence, particularly in the liturgical framing (the opening prayer and the closing benediction). The use of parallelism and repetition (e.g., the 'Come, my Joy' quote) enhances the oral quality. There is a clear 'legato' feel to the reflections on long-term marriage, contrasting with the 'staccato' energy of the youth ministry description. While it occasionally feels like a written essay, the inclusion of hymns and songs provides a natural 'breath' and musicality to the performance. The ending builds a rhythmic momentum that mirrors the 'banner' song mentioned earlier.",
      "quotes": [
        "Come, my Joy, my Love, my Heart; Such a Joy, as none can move...",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high level of linguistic care and precision, characteristic of the 'stewardship of language.' While the imagery relies heavily on the biblical text and external quotes, it is deployed with intellectual rigour. The musicality is dignified, benefiting from the rhythmic nature of the Song of Songs and the liturgical tradition. It avoids the 'paper language' of pure academia by grounding its precision in concrete pastoral memories and a clear, rhythmic oral delivery."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The structure is more thematic than narrative, following a 'homiletical plot' that moves from the 'problem' of modern interpretation to the 'solution' of theological retrieval and finally to pastoral application. There is an 'upsetting of equilibrium' regarding how we read the Song (erotic vs. spiritual). However, the movement is somewhat episodic—shifting from Bede to youth ministry to Princeton to Jane Fonda. The 'arc' is held together by the theme of 'Love against the Odds,' but it lacks a singular, driving tension that builds to a climax. It functions more as a guided tour through layers of meaning than a dramatic journey.",
      "quotes": [
        "Who would have thought, only three decades ago, that biblical interpretation was about to make an amazing turn!",
        "I need to set the stage for you.",

        "Create a more singular 'conflict' or 'question' that persists through all the anecdotes.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength, exemplifying Cilliers' 'reframing.' It masterfully connects the 'then' of the Song of Songs with the 'now' of 1970s youth ministry, 2009 campus culture, and the reality of long-term marriage. The preacher respects the 'strangeness' of the Song (its eroticism) while reframing it through the lens of the Incarnation (Bede). The synthesis of Jane Fonda’s longing with the Song’s 'longing' is a surprising and effective reframing of contemporary celebrity culture within the biblical narrative of exile and restoration.",
      "quotes": [
        "the Word was made flesh... to live 'outside' with us mortal men and women",
        "The lover’s garden is... the garden of delight that Eden was meant to be",

      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant use of the 'outside/inside' motif to link the Song to the Incarnation.",
        "The 'reframing' of sexual energy as a pointer to the Trinity is aesthetically and theologically profound.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection to the 'Pastors' Conference' context could be more explicit in the application.",
        "The transition from Genesis 2 to the Princeton anecdote is a bit abrupt.",
        "Could explore the 'odds' of the title more deeply in the contemporary context."

      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing: human sexuality is framed as an image of the Trinity's 'going out' from itself."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon functions as an 'open work of art' (Stark) by acknowledging the 'layered meaning' and refusing to choose between the carnal and the spiritual. It leaves room for the 'ambivalence of existence' by mentioning that 'no human relationship is perfect' and addressing those who feel 'uneasy about what is past.' The ending is an invitation to the 'banqueting table,' which is both a closed liturgical act and an open eschatological hope. It avoids being a 'sealed' moralistic tract by emphasizing longing and 'not yet' over immediate, easy resolutions.",
      "quotes": [
        "we won’t want to make a strict separation between the carnal meaning and the spiritual meaning.",
        "there is much more seeking and longing than there is realization.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The moral application regarding 'promiscuity' risks closing the space for those currently struggling.",

        "Ensure the 'elder' perspective doesn't come across as a 'closed' authority."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Polyvalent: it allows for carnal, spiritual, and psychological entries into the text."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is characterized by a sophisticated integration of text and context. While the narrative arc is somewhat episodic, the 'reframing' of eros through the lens of the Incarnation provides a strong thematic backbone. The sermon maintains an 'open' quality by sustaining the tension between carnal reality and spiritual longing, avoiding the 'kitsch' of easy moralism. It moves from intellectual retrieval to pastoral vulnerability, creating a space for grace that respects the complexity of human relationships."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully avoids religious kitsch by refusing to offer 'immediate comfort' or 'happy endings' regarding marriage and sexuality. By acknowledging that 'the intensity does not last' and that marriage is 'love against the odds,' the preacher grounds the aesthetics in authentic experience rather than sentimentality. The inclusion of Jane Fonda's longing and the 'retroactive grace' for past failures prevents the sermon from becoming a 'clichéd story with a happy ending.' It sustains the 'pain of the garden' (Eden) alongside the beauty of the Song.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'banner over me is love' song could border on kitsch if not for the preacher's grounding it in the 'prodigious eros' of actual teenagers.",
      "The mention of Jimmy Carter's marriage risks being a 'sentimental example' but is saved by the context of Jane Fonda's genuine longing."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission that 'none of us got much sleep' and the 'strict' reality of youth ministry.",
      "The honest reflection on the 'sadness' of fading passion in long-term marriage."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the focus on 'longing' and 'not yet' to ensure the 'banqueting table' remains a sign of grace rather than a sentimental cliché."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened primarily through the concept of 'reframing' and the 'retroactive' nature of God's love. The preacher moves beyond 'moralization' (we must be faithful) to 'grace' (God is faithful). By linking human 'ecstasy' to God's 'ecstasy' in the Incarnation, the sermon creates a 'space' where human desire is not suppressed but transformed. The mystery of God's presence is respected in the 'ineffable ways' marriages are sustained, and the 'unimaginable word' of the Resurrection.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'young love' and 'long-term companionship' is sustained, as is the tension between the carnal and spiritual.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, particularly in the discussion of the 'future restoration of all things' which lies 'beyond us.'",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; even the moral standards (Anscombe Society) are framed as 'dignity' and 'respect' rather than mere rules.",
    "recommendation": "Continue to emphasize the 'unavailable' nature of the consummation to keep the space open for the Holy Spirit's work."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.3,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a sophisticated example of 'theological retrieval' as an aesthetic act. It moves beyond the flat, historical-critical 'erotic poetry' reading to a polyvalent, 'open work of art' that integrates the carnal and the spiritual. The aesthetic power lies in its 'reframing'—taking the raw energy of human eros and showing it to be an image of the Triune God's 'going out' toward the other. The language is precise and 'stewardly,' avoiding the kitsch of sentimental religious talk about love. While the structure is more episodic than a tight narrative plot, the thematic consistency and the use of 'inter-esse' (moving between the garden of Eden and the garden of the Song) create a compelling aesthetic experience. It succeeds in 'opening space for grace' by acknowledging human failure and the 'not yet' of fulfillment, making the gospel a gift rather than a task.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Theological Reframing: Linking human 'ecstasy' to the Incarnation via the Venerable Bede.",
      "Stewardship of Language: Precise, nuanced, and dignified prose that avoids jargon.",
      "Authenticity: Grounding the 'spiritual' meaning in the 'carnal' reality of youth ministry and long-term marriage."

      "Dramaturgical Movement: Strengthening the narrative arc between the diverse anecdotes.",
      "Sensory Imagery: Utilizing more of the Song's primary sensory data (smell, taste) in the preacher's own voice.",

    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'showing' the biblical scene more vividly before moving to the 'commentary'.",
      "Use a single, recurring contemporary image to anchor the various 'layers' of meaning.",
      "Deepen the 'musicality' by using more rhetorical figures like alliteration in the key theological transitions."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically strong performance of 'theological retrieval.' It avoids the pitfalls of both dry academicism and sentimental kitsch. By honoring the 'layered' nature of the text, it invites the listener into a space where their own desires are reframed in the light of God's grace. It is a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that finds beauty in the simplicity of faithful companionship and the profound mystery of the Incarnation. It serves as a model for how to handle 'difficult' or 'erotic' texts with dignity, precision, and grace."
