    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes the biblical narrative of the lame beggar to ground its theological claims. However, the imagery remains largely dependent on the biblical text itself rather than fresh, contemporary metaphors. The 'talk/walk' metaphor is the central linguistic engine, which is functional but bordering on a cliché. While the preacher describes the beggar's physical restoration ('feet and ankles were made strong'), the contemporary application shifts quickly into abstract social categories like 'capitalism' and 'minimum wage' without providing sensory 'showing' for those modern realities. According to Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' rule, the sermon succeeds in the biblical 'page' but reverts to 'telling' in the contemporary application.",
      "quotes": [
        "Immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. Jumping up, he stood and began to walk...",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably clear and avoids dense dogmatic jargon. Brueggemann (or the preacher in this style) practices a 'stewardship of language' by redefining terms like 'resurrection' as 'Easter acts' in the present. The precision is found in the rhythmic antitheses (talk vs. walk, chatter vs. truth). However, the use of terms like 'capitalism' and 'democracy' feels somewhat broad and lacks the surgical precision McEntyre advocates for. The sermon is accessible, hitting the core of the message without 'Canaanite' obscuration, but it occasionally sacrifices nuance for rhetorical force.",
      "quotes": [
        "The apostles did not quibble.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest micro-aesthetic feature. The text exhibits a prophetic cadence, utilizing parallelism and repetition ('How long... How long...') reminiscent of Hebrew poetry. The sentence structure varies effectively between short, punchy assertions and longer, flowing descriptions. There is a palpable 'staccato' in the bulleted points about the apostles, creating a sense of urgency. The rhythmic return to the 'talk/walk' motif acts as a refrain, making the sermon highly 'oral' and memorable. It avoids 'paper language' entirely, sounding like a living voice.",
      "quotes": [
        "It permits us to talk the talk of Easter... It allows us to walk the walk of Easter...",
        "He was strong. He was active. He was glad. He was ready to praise God.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon displays a high degree of oral-rhetorical skill. Its strength lies in its rhythmic, prophetic cadence and clarity. While the imagery is largely tied to the biblical text, it is used effectively to create a 'cinematic' sense of the Acts narrative. The language is precise and avoids theological obscurity, though it occasionally leans on contemporary socio-political categories that lack the poetic depth of the biblical sections. Overall, it is a strong example of 'stewardship of language' that prioritizes communication and impact over decorative beauty."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a logical three-part structure (I. Talk, II. Walk, III. The Beggar's Voice). While it isn't a 'static three-point' sermon in the traditional sense, it lacks a profound 'upsetting of the equilibrium' or a deep 'Lowry-esque' plot. The movement is more thematic than narrative. The 'turning point' is the shift from Jesus' resurrection to the beggar's restoration, which is effective but predictable. The tension is maintained through the challenge to the 'authorities' and 'empire', but the resolution (we are empowered) comes quite early and is sustained rather than discovered through a struggle.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a masterclass in 'reframing' (Cilliers). The preacher connects the 1st-century healing of a lame man to 21st-century healthcare, minimum wage, and systemic greed. This is not a 'forced' application but an organic extension of the 'Author of Life' concept. The sermon reframes the 'alms' of the temple as the 'justice' of the modern state, forcing the hearer to see the biblical text as a political and social reality rather than just a spiritual miracle. It honors the 'strangeness' of the miracle while making it uncomfortably relevant.",
      "quotes": [
        "The move from Easter talk to the Easter walk is from Jesus to the beggar.",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Aesthetically, the sermon leans toward 'closedness'. It is a 'witness' that asserts truths rather than an 'open work of art' (Stark) that invites ambiguity. The preacher 'tells' the congregation what Easter means and what the church's business is. While the call to action is powerful, there is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or the 'resistance' of the hearer. The conclusion is a 'signing on'—a prescriptive ending. It functions more as a prophetic manifesto than a polyvalent poem. The 'mystery' of the resurrection is explicitly protected from debate, which, while dogmatically firm, closes aesthetic exploration.",

    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon is structurally robust and rhetorically persuasive. Its primary aesthetic achievement is the 'reframing' of biblical narrative into contemporary social ethics. However, it follows a somewhat predictable thematic arc and maintains a 'closed' posture. It functions as a powerful declaration (kerygma) but offers little room for the hearer's own interpretive struggle or the 'holy' as an unavailable mystery. It is a 'witness' sermon (Long) that successfully moves from the 'then' to the 'now' but does so with a prescriptive energy that limits its 'openness' as a work of art."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully avoids religious kitsch. It does not offer 'cheap comfort' or 'pre-chewed emotions'. By linking Easter to the 'upsetting' of authorities and the 'deathly structures of greed', it maintains a 'sober beauty'. There is no 'happy ending' sentimentality; instead, there is a call to difficult, systemic work. The beggar's joy is grounded in a 'resurrection' that is described as a 'wonder' that 'does not fit explanatory categories', avoiding the cliché of 'Jesus makes everything better'. It takes the 'pain of suffering' seriously by mentioning the 'cold restless sleep' and 'shame'.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace as a 'power for newness' that is 'beyond our control'. Cilliers' concept of 'reframing' is the primary way space is created—by breaking the 'fixed frames' of despair. However, the space is somewhat 'closed' by the heavy moral imperative at the end. The 'Space for Grace' is quickly filled with the 'Work of the Church'. While the sermon starts with God's act (the big wonder), it concludes heavily on the human agent (the small wonder). The tension between 'already' and 'not yet' is present but resolved quickly through the call to 'repentance and forgiveness'.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between 'distress' and 'room' are sustained well in the Psalm section, but social tensions are resolved through a call to action.",

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of the 'Prophetic-Reframing' style. Its primary beauty lies not in baroque decoration but in the 'sober beauty' of a clear, rhythmic, and challenging witness. It excels in the micro-aesthetics of rhythm and the macro-aesthetics of integration. The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Thomas Long), painting a vivid picture of the biblical event and then 'reframing' it (Johan Cilliers) to expose the 'chatter' and 'despair' of the modern world. The language is 'stewarded' with care, avoiding jargon and hitting the core of the gospel's social implications. However, the sermon is aesthetically 'closed'; it functions as a manifesto that directs the hearer toward specific social and ethical conclusions. While this is rhetorically effective, it limits the 'polyvalence' (Stark) of the sermon as an 'open work of art'. The 'Space for Grace' is initially opened by the wonder of God's act but is rapidly occupied by the ethical demands of the 'Easter walk'. It is a sermon of high 'performance' value that creates an 'event' of challenge, though it risks becoming 'moralistic' in its final application.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Prophetic rhythm and cadence (Musicality).",
      "Profound reframing of biblical miracle into social justice (Integration).",

    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' to let the 'power from on high' linger as a mystery.",
      "Use more 'sensory' language when describing the 'deathly structures' to match the vividness of the biblical healing.",
      "Acknowledge the 'liminal space' between the 'talk' and the 'walk' where many believers struggle."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a highly effective rhetorical event that achieves its purpose of 'witness'. Aesthetically, it is a 7/10: it is 'good' and 'strong' but stops short of the 'exceptional' due to its monovalent, closed structure. It is a model of how to use biblical narrative to critique modern reality, but it could grow in aesthetic depth by allowing the 'holy' to remain more 'unavailable' and the hearer more 'active' in the interpretation."
