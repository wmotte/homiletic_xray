  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and promotes high levels of autonomy. By utilizing an Adult ego state to analyze power structures, the preacher avoids the common trap of the Critical Parent (shaming the congregation) or the Rescuer (making the congregation dependent on the preacher's grace). The focus on 'mini-resurrections' encourages the Free Child's spontaneity and the Adult's agency. It successfully transforms a religious narrative into a framework for personal and social empowerment without resorting to manipulative 'Games.'",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Empire' is a broad target; more Adult specificity on how the 'status quo' manifests in the listener's immediate 'here-and-now' could further strengthen the reality-testing.",
      "Ensure the 'mocking' of authorities doesn't slide into a 'NIGYSOB' game against political opponents."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I invite you to think' and 'Imagine' as these are classic Adult-hooking phrases that prevent the listener from slipping into a passive Adapted Child state."
