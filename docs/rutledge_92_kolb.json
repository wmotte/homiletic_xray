    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a contemporary 'slice of life' regarding media coverage of evangelicalism, which provides a recognizable cultural hook. However, the experience remains largely intellectual and observational rather than deeply emotive or personal. The identification with characters (Bede, Cuthbert, Zerubbabel) is historical rather than experiential; the hearer is invited to look at them rather than stand in their shoes. The 'feeling' level is restricted to a sense of ecclesiastical identity and the tension of modern church politics.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This phase is well-developed through the lens of cultural and historical analysis. The preacher pauses to ask why the term 'evangelical' has become a point of division and explores the 'theological emergency' of the Babylonian exile. It effectively analyzes the human condition of feeling 'redundant' or 'small' in the face of grand history. It avoids premature solutions by dwelling on the 'day of small things' and the low point of post-exilic Judea.",
      "quotes": [
        "This idea of a clear-cut division between evangelical churches and liberal mainline churches is doing a great deal of damage to the Church of Christ.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the strongest quadrant of the sermon. The preacher provides a robust theological definition of 'evangelical' faith, rooted in the Reformation, Augustine, and Paul. The exegesis of Zechariah 4:6 is central and logically connected to the 'divine initiative.' The 'big idea'—that God works through small things by His Spirit—is clearly formulated and supported by dogmatic deepening (Christology, Grace, pneumatology).",

        "Evangelical theology means a primary emphasis on the grace of God. It means a high degree of reverence for the Scripture.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is weakest in concrete application. While it identifies the 'what' (building the Body of Christ rather than just buildings), it offers few specific 'how-to' steps for the congregation. The application is largely directed at the new Rector (Doug Holmes) as a 'leader like Zerubbabel,' leaving the laity as observers of his ministry rather than active participants. The call to action is more of a 'call to perspective.'",

    "summary": "The sermon is a robust theological and historical defense of 'evangelical' identity within an Anglican context. It succeeds significantly in Abstract Conceptualization and Reflective Observation, providing the congregation with a clear intellectual framework for understanding their tradition and the biblical text. It effectively uses the 'theological emergency' of the exile to interpret modern ecclesiastical anxieties. However, the sermon falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase. The application is largely conceptual or directed at the new Rector, leaving the congregation without specific, practical steps to take in their own 'day of small things.' The tone is scholarly and dignified, appropriate for an installation, but it risks leaving the 'accommodating' learner (the doer) behind. The movement through the 'Homiletic Window' is primarily Declarative and Visionary, with Narrative serving as illustration rather than the primary driver of the learning process.",

      "Strategic advice 1: Start with a human-interest story that highlights a 'small thing' in a parishioner's life to strengthen Concrete Experience.",

      "Strategic advice 3: Use more 'Narrative' structure where the biblical characters' struggle becomes the hearer's struggle."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This is a strong, intellectually grounded sermon that functions well as a 'teaching' moment for a congregation in transition. It provides a necessary theological 'anchor' (Abstract Conceptualization) and a helpful cultural 'map' (Reflective Observation). From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'half-cycle' sermon—excellent at moving from experience to theory, but hesitant to move from theory back into new, concrete action. The primary priority for improvement is the development of the 'Pragmatic' and 'Active Experimentation' quadrants to ensure that the 'Spirit's power' is not just a theological concept but a lived reality for the people in the pews."
