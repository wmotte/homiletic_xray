      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a relatable linguistic distinction and a historical anecdote about a king's riddle. This creates an intellectual 'hook' rather than a visceral emotional experience. While it engages the hearer's curiosity, it lacks a contemporary 'slice of life' that touches the immediate emotional reality of the congregation. The identification with the disciples' grief (the 'good-bye talk') provides the strongest moment of concrete empathy.",

He uses the concepts of 'localization' versus 'universality' and the 'accomplished fact' of the resurrection to explain the text.

While it ends with an invitation to prayer and a visionary call to 'greater works,' it lacks specific, ethical action steps for the hearer's Monday morning.

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of a 'Declarative-Visionary' hybrid. It begins by identifying a theological 'riddle' and uses the preacher's own long-term struggle as a reflective bridge. The core of the sermon is a robust theological explanation of the Ascension, arguing that Jesus' physical absence is the key to the Church's global 'greater works.' While the logic is clear and the ending is inspiring, the sermon falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase. It lacks concrete, contemporary applications that would help a modern hearer understand how to perform 'greater works' in their specific context. The language is dignified and the structure is logical, but it leans heavily toward the 'Assimilating' learning style, potentially leaving 'Converging' and 'Accommodating' learners without a clear path to action.",

      "Clear and compelling theological logic regarding the Ascension",

    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Start with a concrete human struggle rather than a linguistic riddle to ground the sermon in experience",
      "Dedicate at least 20% of the sermon to specific, ethical applications (Active Experimentation)",
      "Use more 'you' language to bridge the gap between the preacher's struggle and the congregation's life"
    ],
    "conclusion": "This is a well-constructed, traditional sermon that excels in theological clarity and visionary inspiration. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon—strong on reflection and conceptualization but light on concrete experience and active application. It successfully resolves a biblical paradox through sound logic, making it highly effective for hearers who value intellectual depth. However, to achieve true homiletical integrality, the preacher should focus on translating these high theological truths into the 'street-level' reality of the congregation's daily lives."
