  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon treats two distinct passages as separate entities rather than a unified proclamation. While it identifies the uniqueness of the Trinitarian blessing in 2 Cor 13, it relies heavily on general 'Trinity' concepts and liturgical history (Book of Common Prayer) rather than extracting what can be found *nowhere else* in these specific texts.",
      "quotes": [
        "The one that we read today is the longest, richest, and fullest of all his valedictory blessings.",
        "The depth of which the psalmist is actually speaking here is the depth of the knowledge that he and everyone else is a 'miserable offender.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus on the specific linguistic tension in the Greek/Hebrew of these verses to find the 'unique' word, rather than importing systematic theology about the Trinity or liturgical history about the 1976 Prayer Book."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is thin. The preacher mentions Paul's 'erratic letter' and the 'most agonized portion of the NT,' but fails to engage with the actual historical-critical or linguistic depth of the Corinthian crisis or the cultic setting of the Psalm. Hebrew and Greek are absent.",
      "quotes": [
        "One commentator called it almost too painful to read.",
        "It is called De Profundis, 'out of the depths.' It begins at rock bottom."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond 'commentator' summaries. Analyze the specific Corinthian opposition Paul faced and how the Trinitarian formula specifically counters that local schism."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is psychologically concrete (drug addiction, anorexia), which Dekker values. However, it risks becoming 'vague romanticized versions of human love' by using parents/aunts as the primary hermeneutical key for God's nature.",
      "quotes": [
        "Maybe he is hooked on drugs and failing in school, maybe she is anorexic and starving herself.",
        "Think of an aunt, a brother, a grandmother, a teacher..."

      "improvement_point": "Connect the application more to the 'zeitgeist' or the collective 'lostness in time' rather than just individual family dynamics."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a 'sandwich' structure: modern anecdote, then text, then back to anecdote. It does not fully 'draw the hearer into the text' so that they are expounded together; the text often serves as a proof-text for the psychological observation.",
      "quotes": [
        "Imagine for a moment... This is the position in which the apostle Paul finds himself.",
        "Reflect on your own life... That person has conveyed to you a measure of the love of God."

      "improvement_point": "Avoid starting with 'Imagine...'; start with the text's own movement so the application arises from the Word's own current."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Strongest point. The sermon explicitly deals with 'misery' (the depths, miserable offenders) and 'redemption' (forgiveness, grace). It avoids being 'too Christocentric' by grounding the misery in the human condition before God.",
      "quotes": [
        "The depth of which the psalmist is actually speaking here is the depth of the knowledge that he and everyone else is a 'miserable offender.'",
        "There is no health in us."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure 'gratitude' is more than a 'renewed confidence' but a concrete 'subject' of the sermon's conclusion."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon flirts with the 'two ways' by mentioning 'self-destruction' and 'lostness,' but it leans heavily toward a universalized 'love that persists in breaking through our resistance,' potentially undermining the seriousness of being 'lost' that Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "The God who pursues us even beyond the grave.",
        "The love that persists in breaking through our resistance."
      ],

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, particularly in the first section. The doctrine of the two natures is implicit in the 'incarnate' love, but Christ often feels like a 'hint' of human love rather than the 'One Lord' who is the sole source of life.",
      "quotes": [
        "God’s love spends itself to the very last drop of the blood of the Son.",
        "The love that has become incarnate in history through Jesus Christ."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At roughly 1450 words, the sermon likely clocks in at 14-15 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for 'depth.'",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section (Thesis 2) to provide the necessary theological weight to reach the 20-minute threshold."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily in duration and exegetical rigor. It relies too heavily on psychological analogies (the parent-child relationship) and liturgical nostalgia (the 1928/1976 Prayer Book debate) rather than the 'recreation' of the specific Bible passage into a current word. While it handles the 'three parts' (misery/redemption) with more honesty than many modern sermons, it lacks the 'two ways' sharpness and the required 20-minute breadth.",
    "strengths": [
      "Honest confrontation with human 'misery' and the reality of sin as 'estrangement'.",
      "Concrete psychological application that avoids purely 'general truths'."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (< 20 mins) prevents necessary theological depth.",
      "Lack of original language engagement and rigorous historical exegesis.",
      "Tendency to use the Bible as a 'hint' for human experience rather than the source of revelation."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an 'adequate' speech with strong psychological insights, but it is not yet a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense. It lacks the exegetical 'workmanship' (the bicycle mechanic's wheel) and the breadth required to truly actualize the Word of God for the current moment."
