    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "While theologically rich, the sermon is psychologically regressive. It utilizes a 'Parent-Child' dynamic that infantilizes the congregation ('sheep are really dumb') to create a sense of total dependency. By stripping the 'sheep' of all verbs, it removes Adult agency and responsibility, potentially fostering a 'Victim' mindset that requires a 'Rescuer' (the Church/God) to function. The critique of consumerism is valid but delivered from a Critical Parent position that uses shame ('phony,' 'greedy') as a primary motivator.",

      "Effective identification of modern 'Gimmicks' like consumerist anxiety."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The dehumanizing metaphor of 'dumb sheep' undermines the Adult ego of the listener.",
      "The total removal of 'verbs' from the listener creates a passivity that is hard to translate into healthy, autonomous living."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as 'Adults' who make conscious choices to trust, rather than 'dumb sheep' who have no choice. Replace Critical Parent 'musts' with Adult 'observations' about the consequences of different loyalties. Allow the 'Free Child' to experience God's goodness without first being shamed for their 'phony' desires."
