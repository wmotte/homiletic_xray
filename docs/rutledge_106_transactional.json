        "presence_of_adaptation": "Low",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exemplary model of psychologically healthy homiletics. It utilizes the Adult ego state to process difficult biblical data while providing a Nurturing Parent framework that validates the listener's struggle. By framing the Trinity not as a 'dry doctrine' but as a 'dynamic interrelatedness' that meets people in their 'last ditch,' the preacher promotes intimacy and autonomy rather than guilt or dependency.",
    "strengths": [
      "High transparency regarding the 'painful' nature of the text.",
      "Avoidance of moralistic 'musts' (Critical Parent).",
      "Strong use of the Adult ego state to analyze historical context."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The opening analogy of the 'drug-addicted child' is powerful but leans heavily on a Parent-Child dynamic that could be overwhelming for some.",
      "Could incorporate more 'Free Child' spontaneity or humor to balance the heavy Adult/NP tone."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name the 'double bottoms' of the biblical text as you did here. By exposing Paul's 'sarcasm' and 'foolishness,' you prevent the text from being used as a tool for a 'NIGYSOB' game."
