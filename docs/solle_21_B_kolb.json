It avoids abstract 'everyman' examples, instead utilizing deeply personal and sensory-rich anecdotes (the glass vial of poison, the mother's desire for death).

    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of experiential preaching that prioritizes the 'Concrete Experience' and 'Reflective Observation' phases of Kolb's cycle. It successfully avoids the pitfall of moralism by grounding its calls to action in deep existential and biographical reflection. The preacher's vulnerability serves as a catalyst for the hearer's own reflection on life's 'transitions'. While the theological framework (Abstract Conceptualization) is present—particularly in the critique of a 'harmless' God—it is less systematically developed than the narrative elements. The sermon addresses 'Accommodating' and 'Diverging' learners with high effectiveness but may offer less for the 'Assimilating' learner who seeks a more structured, logical argument. The transition from personal grief to global political activism is bold, though it risks losing the intimate connection established in the first half.",

      "Exceptional use of personal narrative to illustrate biblical truth",

      "Use more 'Declarative' markers to help logical learners follow the argument."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a highly effective, experience-oriented piece of homiletic work. It succeeds in making the ancient text of Jacob at the Jabbok immediate and urgent for a modern audience. Its primary strength lies in the 'Concrete Experience' phase, where it uses biographical depth to bypass intellectual resistance. From a Kolb perspective, the cycle is complete but unbalanced, favoring the 'feeling' and 'watching' quadrants over 'thinking'. The priority for improvement would be to provide a more robust 'Abstract Conceptualization' to anchor the powerful emotional and narrative movements in a clearer theological structure."
