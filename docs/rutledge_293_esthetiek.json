    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Rutledge employs imagery not to decorate, but to contrast. She utilizes the 'generic Easter' images (bunnies, butterflies, sap rising) as a foil for the 'real Easter' imagery. The most striking aesthetic move is the use of autumnal/harvest imagery for a spring festival, which creates a productive 'estrangement' (Cilliers). By invoking the 'furrows of the grave' and the 'stench' of death implied by the women's errand, she avoids the 'soft focus' kitsch she critiques. However, the imagery remains largely verbal/descriptive rather than cinematic; she 'tells' the significance of the images more than she lets the images speak for themselves. The strength lies in the 'sober beauty' of the contrast between the 'pretty display' of greeting cards and the 'panicky women running pell-mell'.",
      "quotes": [
        "All the cards had flowers, bunnies, and butterflies on them. The messages were along the lines of 'Happy Spring!'",
        "The golden ears of harvest will their heads before him wave, ripened by his glorious sunshine from the furrows of the grave.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise, demonstrating what McEntyre calls 'stewardship of language.' Rutledge carefully distinguishes between 'renewal' and 'resurrection,' refusing to let theological concepts slide into vague sentiment. Her critique of 'Canaanite language' (religious jargon) is meta-textual; she identifies how words like 'rebirth' have become empty and replaces them with the 'bald fashion' of the New Testament. The word choice is economical and sharp. She avoids the 'anesthetized' language of typical holiday sermons by using jarring terms like 'pell-mell,' 'concerted attack,' and 'unsettling.' The precision serves the content: the radicality of the event requires radical clarity of speech.",
      "quotes": [
        "‘Renewal,’ ‘revival,’ ‘rebirth’ — these are the wrong words. Resurrection, in the Christian tradition, means something else.",
        "The New Testament proclamation of the Resurrection has been under such concerted attack that a great many Episcopal clergy no longer believe in it.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a steady, homiletical cadence, but it is more rhetorical than poetic. It functions well as an 'oral event' (Immink) through the use of repetition and the 'I believe' sequences toward the end. There is a clear variation in sentence length—short, punchy sentences ('The tomb is empty') are used to punctuate longer, more complex theological arguments. However, it occasionally feels like 'paper language' in the sections where she quotes other sermons or scholars. The rhythm is that of a witness giving testimony—earnest and direct—rather than a poet weaving a tapestry. It lacks the lyrical 'flow' of a more contemplative aesthetic but gains power through its staccato-like assertions of faith.",
      "quotes": [
        "Trembling and bewildered … they said nothing to anyone because they were afraid.",
        "He is not in nature, he is not in the ground, he is not in the trees, he is not in the sap rising — 'He is not here — he is risen.'",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are defined by a 'sober beauty' and an ethics of precision. Rutledge avoids the 'aestheticism' of flowery Easter language to recover the 'bald' power of the text. Her imagery is used dialectically—contrasting the 'kitsch' of culture with the 'terror' of the Gospel. While not highly lyrical or musical in a poetic sense, the language is a model of 'stewardship,' where every word is chosen to strip away sentimentality and reveal the 'unlooked-for' reality of the Resurrection. It is the language of a witness, not a decorator."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' of the typical Easter attendee by attacking their expectations of a 'Spring Festival.' The tension builds as Rutledge exposes the 'terror' of Mark's ending and the 'concerted attack' on the Resurrection. The turning point (the 'clue') is found in the 'strange ending' itself—that the fear of the women is the only appropriate response to a 'world-overturning power.' The movement from the 'greeting card' to the 'hit-and-run' tragedy provides a dramatic shift from the abstract to the concrete. The conclusion offers a resolution not through a 'happy ending,' but through the act of witnessing. It is a journey from false comfort to true hope.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. Rutledge performs a masterclass in 'reframing' (Cilliers). She takes the 'strangeness' of Mark 16:8—the fear and silence—and uses it to reframe the contemporary context of secularized, 'anesthetized' Easter. The text is not 'smoothed over' for consumption; rather, its jagged edges are used to cut through the 'Christmas syndrome' of the culture. The integration of the Detroit tragedy provides a 'contextual anchor' that makes the 'resurrection of the body' a necessary reality rather than a dogmatic abstraction. She respects the 'then' of the text while making it the only viable 'now' for a world of hit-and-runs and bereavement.",
      "quotes": [
        "Maybe an early New England Easter with bare branches is a good thing... the real message of Easter Day has nothing to do with the return of spring greenery.",
        "The reason those messages are not found on greeting cards... is that they all speak of death and you can’t mention death on a greeting card.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "As an 'open work of art' (Stark), the sermon succeeds by leaving the 'terror' of the Resurrection intact. Rutledge does not offer a 'neat' resolution where all fear is removed; instead, she invites the hearer to 'tremble' along with the women. The ending is 'open' in the sense that it places the burden of 'witness' on the hearer. However, the theological structure is quite 'closed' in its dogmatic insistence on the physical resurrection. While she respects the 'mystery,' she is very prescriptive about what *cannot* be called Easter (renewal, rebirth). It is polyvalent in its emotional range (grief, terror, joy) but monovalent in its theological core. It invites the hearer into a 'space for grace' that is strictly defined by the empty tomb.",
      "quotes": [
        "I don’t 'know' it exactly... The Resurrection is not of that order of knowledge. It is a gift of faith.",
        "This terror may be what Mark wanted the church to grasp.",
        "There you will see him, just as he told you."

    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics of the sermon are characterized by a powerful dramaturgical movement from the 'kitsch' of the surface to the 'terror' of the depths. Rutledge uses the 'strange ending' of Mark as a structural pivot, refusing to resolve the tension of the empty tomb too quickly. The integration of text and context is seamless, using the 'bare branches' of the season and the 'bare facts' of tragedy to reframe the Resurrection as a 'world-overturning' event. The structure is that of a 'witness'—it moves toward a testimony that is both personally grounded and theologically rigorous."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is a profound 'anti-kitsch' manifesto. Rutledge explicitly identifies and rejects 'religious kitsch'—the 'soft focus' greeting cards, the 'Happy Spring' messages, and the 'generic' comfort that avoids the reality of death. She follows Cilliers' warning against 'pre-chewed emotions' by insisting on the 'terror' and 'astonishment' of the original event. The use of the Detroit tragedy is not sentimental; it is used to show the *failure* of kitsch ('Ordinary words of comfort were not reaching him'). The sermon achieves authentic aesthetic depth by sustaining the 'pain of the season' alongside the 'hope of the resurrection.' It is a 'sober' aesthetic that finds beauty in the 'bald' truth.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'Easter cards with flowers, bunnies, and butterflies' in the church bookstore.",
      "The 'generic' use of words like 'renewal' and 'rebirth' to avoid the scandal of death."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the mother whose child died in the spring, for whom 'fragrances are a torment'.",
      "The refusal to 'know' the resurrection like a daffodil bulb, admitting it is a 'gift of faith'."

    "recommendation": "Continue to use the 'via negativa'—defining the truth by what it is *not*—to protect the 'Space for Grace' from sentimental encroachment."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Rutledge opens a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) by clearing away the 'clutter' of cultural religion. By emphasizing that we have 'no human right to hope for it,' she makes the Resurrection a pure 'event' of grace—something 'unlooked-for' and 'unavailable.' She sustains the tension between the 'dying world' and the 'living God.' The space is not closed by moralism ('we must do better'); instead, it is opened by the 'booster rocket' of the Gospel which propels the hearer into a 'world-transforming view.' The mystery of God is respected as the 'Creator of nature' who acts 'beyond nature.' Grace prevails because the 'decree of death' is set aside by an external act of God, not a human process of 'renewal.'",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'terror' of the women and the 'indescribable joy' of the Gospel is held until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes; the Resurrection is treated as a 'stupendous' mystery that cannot be 'known' through natural observation.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the sermon is an announcement of what God has done, not a list of what we must do.",
    "recommendation": "To create even more space, the preacher could further explore the 'Galilee' as a space of ongoing, mysterious encounter in the 'here and now'."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'Reformed-Ecumenical' preaching that prioritizes the 'sober beauty' of the Word over sentimental decoration. Its primary aesthetic power lies in its 'reframing' of the Easter event—shifting the lens from a 'Spring Festival' to a 'world-overturning' invasion of the Holy. Rutledge uses language as a 'steward,' precisely carving out space for the 'real Easter' by deconstructing the kitsch of the 'generic Easter.' The dramaturgy is effective, moving from a critique of culture to a profound encounter with the 'strangeness' of the Markan text, and finally to a grounded, personal testimony. While it leans more toward the 'rhetorical-declarative' than the 'poetic-imagistic,' its aesthetic integrity is found in its refusal to 'smooth over' the jagged edges of the Gospel. It creates a 'Space for Grace' by taking death seriously, thereby making the Resurrection 'stupendous' rather than 'anesthetized.'",

      "Profound 'anti-kitsch' stance that recovers the 'terror' and 'astonishment' of the Gospel.",
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the biblical text (Mark 16:8) within the contemporary cultural context.",

      "Experiment with more sensory 'showing' of the biblical landscape.",
      "Incorporate more 'open' endings that allow the silence of the women to resonate in the sanctuary.",
      "Use more poetic devices (alliteration, rhythm) to elevate the 'musicality' of the proclamation."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Fleming Rutledge’s 'Easter Day 1997' is an aesthetically significant sermon that functions as a corrective to the 'aestheticism' of modern holiday preaching. By reclaiming the 'strange ending' of Mark, she demonstrates that the highest homiletic aesthetic is not 'beauty' in the sense of prettiness, but 'beauty' in the sense of the 'sublime'—that which is both terrifying and wonderful. It is a sermon that 'opens space' by closing the door on clichés. Through its precision, its refusal of kitsch, and its courageous reframing, it serves as a model for 'witness-preaching' in a secular age."
