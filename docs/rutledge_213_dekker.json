  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon centers on the concept of 'reckoning' (logizomai) from Romans 4. It correctly identifies the unconditional nature of the promise to Abraham as a specific textual feature. However, it leans toward a general 'gospel of grace' rather than exhausting what is unique to this pericope alone.",
      "quotes": [
        "Paul found a word in Genesis 15:6... that he made the centerpiece of his discussion... The word is 'reckon'.",
        "Paul was struck by the fact that it was not only a call, but also a promise, and that the promise was unconditional."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more sharply on why Paul uses Abraham specifically to dismantle the concept of 'religious status' in this exact rhetorical moment of the epistle."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates awareness of the Greek term 'logizomai' and the Old Testament background (Genesis 12/15). However, the exegesis remains at a surface level, functioning more as a word study than a deep dive into the theological-historical context of Israel's covenant.",
      "quotes": [
        "Paul has drawn his interpretation of Abraham from the Hebrew scriptures.",
        "He uses it the way an accountant would use it if he were going to 'reckon' up a column of figures."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exploration of the 'religious history' of the Second Temple period's view of Abraham to contrast more sharply with Paul’s radical re-reading."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is concrete, referencing a basement mechanic, Mother Teresa, and a specific parish building fund. It avoids vague 'be good' moralism by rooting the application in the parish's actual life and history.",
      "quotes": [
        "God is just as close to my basement waterproofing man as he is to me.",
        "We have embarked upon a capital fund drive to restore our Federal Buildings for future use."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application to the 'zeitgeist' goes beyond the local parish walls to address the broader cultural philosophy of meritocracy."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Exposition and application are reasonably mixed. The preacher moves from the biblical 'reckoning' to the 'reckoning' of the congregation’s own history. However, the transition to the building fund feels somewhat tacked on at the end.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now what this means for us is that everything that separates us from each other is swept away.",
        "Now it is time for us to think about what we want to engrave logizomai on in the 1990s."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the 'second half' application structure; let the building fund discussion be more thoroughly 'expounded' through the lens of the text from the start."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon strongly emphasizes misery (ungodliness) and redemption (justification). Gratitude is present in the discussion of the building fund as a response to grace, though the 'misery' could be more existentially biting.",
      "quotes": [
        "Paul selects the truly heroic figure of Abraham to demonstrate the unrighteousness and ungodliness of all mankind.",
        "We are a community of sinners who are daily rediscovering our utter dependence on the faithfulness and mercy of God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Sharpen the 'misery' aspect by addressing the specific 'lostness' of the modern religious person who relies on their own 'closeness to God'."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "This is the weakest point. While the preacher mentions that thinking of models of righteousness 'leads to death,' there is little sense of the 'two ways' or the gravity of being lost. The tone is perhaps too comforting.",
      "quotes": [
        "When we think of Abraham... as models of righteousness... it leads to death, because it is a form of idolatry."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the 'seriousness of the destination.' What is the consequence of remaining in the 'idolatry' of self-justification?"

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon concludes with a strong focus on the 'righteousness of God' through the eyes of the Son. The doctrine of grace is the heartbeat of the message.",
      "quotes": [
        "The one Lord who is central in the sermon is Christ.",
        "Beholding us ungodly offenders through the eyes of his beloved Son."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly link the 'reckoning' to the cross/resurrection (Romans 4:24-25) to ground the 'logizomai' in the objective work of Christ."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At roughly 18 minutes (1850 words), the sermon falls just short of Dekker’s 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for true homiletic 'depth' according to Miskotte's dictum.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section or the cultural analysis to reach the 20-minute threshold, allowing the text more room to breathe."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a clear and traceable exposition of Romans 4, focusing on the radical nature of grace. It falls short on the 'two ways' (Thesis 6) and the required length for depth (Thesis 8). The exegesis is adequate but lacks the rigorous academic 'breadth' Dekker expects from a trained minister. It succeeds in making the application concrete to the specific congregation.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application to the specific life of the parish (building fund, local history).",
      "Clear focus on the 'unconditional' nature of the promise, avoiding moralism.",
      "Effective use of a single Greek keyword (logizomai) to anchor the theological movement."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (under 20 minutes) limits the potential for theological depth.",
      "The 'seriousness of being lost' is underdeveloped; the 'two ways' are not sharply contrasted.",
      "The exegesis stays on the surface of the word 'reckon' without exploring the broader covenantal logic of Romans."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'satisfactory' sermon (Score: 5.8). While it rightly proclaims the Gospel and avoids general truths, it lacks the 'breadth' and the 'seriousness of the two ways' that Dekker demands for a truly robust proclamation."
