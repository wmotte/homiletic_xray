Een tafel waarover in de onderwijzing die we nog zullen horen, wordt gezegd dat we er door Christus zelf toe worden uitgenodigd. [...] Neem dan de uitnodiging aan, want het is voor u. Of u nou rein en heilig bent, of u nou heel gelovig bent of er altijd maar aan twijfelt, of u zonder zonde bent of zondaar. U hoeft zelf niets mee te brengen. U hoeft alleen maar te komen. Amen.",

  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a solid exegetical framework, focusing on the Johannine concept of 'signs' (semeia) and the 'hour'. The theological 'Sache' is the transformation of the old (purification jars/synagogue) into the new (wine/Gospel). The preacher correctly identifies Cana as the 'prototype'. However, the exegesis of the 'mother' as a symbol for the synagogue, while homiletically useful, borders on over-allegorization without sufficient biblical-theological grounding for a lay audience. The distinction between the 'first-century peasant wedding' and the 'sign' is clear, but the preacher occasionally drifts into abstract symbolism that might bypass the concrete reality of the text for some listeners.",
      "quotes": [
        "Kana het eerste teken is. Het prototype.",

      "comprehensibility_check": "Appropriate for a regular congregation, though the symbolic 'mother' concept requires more 'blue' evidence."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher remains largely behind the text, which is homiletically virtuous but psychologically distant. There is a sense of 'controlled passion'—the preacher is clearly moved by the inclusivity of the Gospel, yet the 'I' is almost entirely absent until the very end. The self-revelation is 'diaconal' in that it serves the text, but it lacks the 'vulnerability of the witness' that Barth often looked for. The preacher reveals a deep respect for tradition while simultaneously asserting a need for its transformation, suggesting a personal tension between liturgical order and the freedom of the Spirit.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ik vind het eigenlijk wel een mooie gedachte.",
        "Zo hoop ik dat het ook ons gegeven wordt.",

      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Depressive mix. The 'Compulsive' side shows in the structured, orderly progression of the text and the focus on 'correct' interpretation of symbols. The 'Depressive' side shows in the strong emphasis on harmony, inclusion, and the 'open table' where everyone is welcome.",
      "diaconal_quality": "High. The preacher does not use the pulpit for self-expression; the ego is subservient to the 'Sache'.",

        "Avoids narcissistic anecdotes.",

    },
    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'solidary'. The preacher uses 'we' and 'us' consistently, placing themselves among the 'sinners and doubters'. There is a paternalistic undertone in the teaching sections, but this is balanced by the radical inclusivity of the invitation. The preacher addresses the congregation as 'Gemeente' and 'u', maintaining a respectful but close distance. The 'yellow' signal is one of safety: the preacher creates a space where the 'relationship noise' of judgment is silenced by the message of grace.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest side. The preacher masterfully navigates the Law/Gospel (Zuspruch/Anspruch) tension. The 'appeal' is not a demand for moral improvement, but a 'Gospel-appeal' to trust and come. The preacher correctly identifies that the 'Law' (purification rites) has been transformed into 'Gift' (wine). The pressure on the listener is zero; the invitation is absolute. In Barthian terms, the 'Acting Subject' is God/Christ, and the human response is simply to 'receive'.",
      "quotes": [
        "U hoeft zelf niets mee te brengen. U hoeft zelf niets gedaan te hebben.",
        "Kom, kom, want alle dingen zijn gereed.",

        "Total focus on the sufficiency of Christ.",

    "disruptions": "A slight 'chafing' between the intellectual symbolic analysis of the first half and the emotional/existential invitation of the second half.",
    "healing_disruption": "The 'hard' word of Jesus to Mary ('What is between us?') serves as a healing disruption, breaking the congregation's attempt to 'own' or 'domesticate' Jesus."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This is a strong, classically Reformed sermon that excels in its transition from exegesis to liturgical invitation. The preacher avoids the trap of moralism by consistently pointing to Christ as the host and the 'wine' as a gift. The psychological profile is one of reliability and 'non-committal warmth' that eventually finds its edge in the radicality of the Gospel invitation. While the symbolic interpretation of Mary as the Synagogue is a heavy 'blue' lift, it serves the 'red' purpose of showing that the Gospel transcends tradition. The sermon successfully moves from the 'Sache' (the sign at Cana) to the 'Existential' (the table today).",
    "barthian_warning": "Low risk of psychologization. The preacher keeps the focus on the 'Acting Subject' (Jesus) rather than the 'inner feelings' of the wedding guests or the congregation.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Excellent Zuspruch/Anspruch balance.",
      "Clear Christological focus.",
      "Effective liturgical integration."

    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce allegorical density regarding 'the mother'.",
      "Increase personal 'witness' presence (green side).",
      "Bridge the gap between the 'first-century' and 'today' more concretely before the final invitation."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively sound and theologically faithful sermon that serves the congregation by clearing the path to the Table."
