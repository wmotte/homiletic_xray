    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' It operates primarily from a healthy Nurturing Parent and an inspired Free Child, inviting the listener's Adult to reflect on ecological and existential responsibility. By presenting a God who is capable of 'change' and 'learning,' the preacher provides a model for the listener's own growth and autonomy. The use of sensory language and inclusive 'we' structures creates a safe, non-coercive environment.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The Adult 'data-processing' could be slightly stronger regarding concrete steps for the 'peace to be made'.",
      "Slight risk of becoming too 'poetic,' which can occasionally bypass the listener's Adult."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using the 'We' perspective. To further strengthen the Adult-Adult transaction, you could ask more open-ended questions that require the listener to apply the 'Rainbow' logic to a specific, difficult conflict in their current reality."
