      "score": 3,
      "analysis": "The sermon is significantly deficient in facilitating concrete experience. It fails to evoke the sensory or emotional atmosphere of a wedding feast. Instead of drawing the hearer into the 'slice of life' at Cana, it immediately retreats into liturgical history and textual comparison. There is no identification with the embarrassment of the wine running out or the joy of the celebration.",

      "analysis": "Reflection is present but primarily academic rather than existential. The preacher explores the 'problem' of the text (the meaning of the sign) rather than the 'problem' of the human condition.

It falls short in the 'Concrete Experience' and 'Active Experimentation' phases of Kolb's cycle, making it a lopsided learning experience. The text is intellectually rigorous and exegetically sound, providing a strong 'Declarative' structure that will appeal to 'Assimilating' learners. However, it lacks the narrative 'hook' and the practical 'handle' necessary for a holistic homiletic. The preacher focuses on the 'doxa' of Jesus as an objective theological fact rather than a lived reality for the congregation. While the 'Visionary' elements regarding the messianic feast provide some inspiration, they remain tethered to ancient texts rather than contemporary longings. The result is a sermon that informs the mind but fails to move the heart or activate the hands.",

    "conclusion": "The sermon is a strong example of 'Assimilating' homiletics, characterized by intellectual depth and logical clarity. However, from a Kolb perspective, it is incomplete. It operates almost entirely in the realm of abstract thought, neglecting the essential phases of concrete experience and active application. While it successfully defends the 'truth' of the text, it fails to facilitate a 'transformation' in the hearer. To improve, the preacher must bridge the gap between the 1st-century 'sign' and the 21st-century 'life', moving the congregation from being passive observers of Jesus' glory to active participants in his kingdom."
