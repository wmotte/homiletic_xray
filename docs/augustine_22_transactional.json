  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, using reason and observation to resolve a theological paradox. It validates the listener's reality (that life is hard) rather than gaslighting them with 'easy' answers. By using analogies of worldly labor (hunters, students), it bridges the gap between the listener's experience and the spiritual message, promoting a sense of agency and internal transformation rather than external compliance.",

      "Could incorporate more 'Free Child' spontaneity to balance the heavy 'Adult' logic.",
      "The mention of 'eternal punishment' could be perceived as a 'Parental' threat if not carefully balanced by the surrounding grace-focused Adult logic."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'Reality Testing' (Adult) to explain spiritual truths. Ensure that the 'Nurturing Parent' comfort always points toward the listener's own 'Adult' responsibility and 'Free Child' joy."
