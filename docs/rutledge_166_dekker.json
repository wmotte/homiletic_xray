  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on one specific pericope. It treats two separate Psalms (51 and 19) as thematic springboards for Lent rather than recreating a specific 'proclamatory word' from one text. It leans toward 'general truths' about sin and repentance rather than the unique specificity of a single passage.",
      "quotes": [
        "Psalm 51, the Ash Wednesday psalm, is the acknowledged masterpiece of biblical self-knowledge.",
        "In the words of our psalm for today, “Who can tell how often he offends? Cleanse thou me from my secret faults” (Ps. 19:12)."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select either Psalm 51 or Psalm 19. Identify the one element in that specific Psalm that exists nowhere else in Scripture and make that the singular starting point."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is almost no historical-critical or linguistic exposition. The original context of the Davidic tradition (Ps 51) or the cosmological/Torah context (Ps 19) is ignored. The preacher treats the texts as timeless psychological or theological categories rather than historical revelation.",
      "quotes": [
        "Sin, at bottom, is not an ethical concept at all. It is a theological concept."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the original setting of the text. For Psalm 19, explain the transition from the glory of the heavens to the precision of the Law to justify the 'hidden faults' mentioned at the end."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is a stronger point. The preacher uses concrete cultural references (Tolkien, Solzhenitsyn, US Presidents) to address the zeitgeist of polarization and moral superiority. It avoids 'cheap' application by challenging the hearer's self-righteousness.",
      "quotes": [
        "Whenever a person takes to himself (or herself) the defining of another person or group as evil, he is in more danger than he knows.",
        "When a nation treats dissent as unpatriotic, the whole world is in trouble."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application flows strictly from the text's unique logic rather than using the text to validate a pre-existing cultural observation."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is more of a thematic essay. Because the 'exposition' (what it meant then) is largely absent, the 'application' (what it means now) dominates. The hearer is not drawn into the text so much as the text is used to decorate a contemporary reflection.",
      "quotes": [
        "The season of Lent reminds the Christian community that the line runs through you and the line runs through me."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Use the specific Hebrew imagery of the text to 'expound' the hearer's current reality simultaneously."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "Strong adherence to the three parts. The sermon deals deeply with 'misery' (sin as a theological reality) and 'redemption' (Christ's work). It avoids being 'too Christocentric' by keeping the human subject's predicament in view.",
      "quotes": [
        "On Ash Wednesday we acknowledge that God has a case against us, and we throw ourselves on his mercy.",
        "The knowledge of grace has preceded the confession of sin."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'gratitude' (sanctification) aspect; the sermon ends on redemption but could more clearly articulate the 'new life' resulting from this mercy."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon addresses the seriousness of being 'lost in time' (social destruction, dehumanization) and 'lost in eternity' (judgment before God). However, the 'narrow way' as a specific choice is somewhat softened by a general emphasis on mercy.",
      "quotes": [
        "We can then give ourselves permission to treat those others as less than fully human... and eventually to destroy them.",
        "The ultimate destiny of human beings is not to be determined by enemies."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'two ways' more explicit as a call to decision. The seriousness of the 'broad way' is present, but the 'narrow way' feels like a passive reception of mercy rather than a 'journey with a purpose'."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon moves toward the cross as the resolution of the human predicament. It correctly identifies Christ as the one who takes the 'sentence' upon Himself.",
      "quotes": [
        "There is Another who has taken the sentence upon himself, and in so doing, has nullified it.",
        "Jesus, the Son of God, has voluntarily taken our place."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly link the 'two natures' of Christ to the specific text's demands to avoid a generic substitutionary theory."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1450 words, the sermon likely clocks in under 15 minutes. According to Dekker, 'depth needs breadth,' and this text feels like two short meditations rather than one deep, 20-minute-plus sermon.",
      "improvement_point": "Focus on one text and expand the exegetical depth to reach the 20-minute threshold."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text falls short of Dekker's formal definition by failing to focus on a single specific pericope and lacking rigorous historical-linguistic exegesis. It functions more as a thematic theological reflection on Lent. However, it succeeds in its psychological depth and its refusal to offer 'general truths,' instead confronting the zeitgeist with the concrete reality of sin and grace.",
    "strengths": [
      "Theological seriousness regarding the nature of sin as a theological rather than merely ethical category.",
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' (misery, redemption, gratitude) to frame the human condition.",
      "Sharp contemporary application that challenges the hearer's political and social self-righteousness."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of formal unity; treating multiple Psalms prevents the 'specificity' Dekker demands.",
      "Insufficient length and breadth to achieve the 'depth' required for a full sermon.",
      "Absence of original language engagement and historical context (Exposition)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a strong theological address or meditation, but it is not yet a 'sermon' in the strict sense of Dekker's theses. It lacks the necessary breadth of time and the specific exegetical grounding in a single biblical passage to qualify as the 'actualization of the written Word'."
