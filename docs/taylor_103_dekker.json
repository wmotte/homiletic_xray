    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to center on one specific Bible passage. It functions as a thematic speech utilizing various biblical motifs (Exodus, 1 Corinthians, John 3:16) rather than recreating a single pericope into a new word. It lacks the 'nowhere else' specificity Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "The wail of Israel's ancient cry was on their hearts, 'Let my people go.'",

      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "There is no formal exposition of the original context of the cited verses. The historical context of Israel or the Johannine community is bypassed in favor of immediate metaphorical application to the Montgomery situation.",

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Application is the sermon's strongest suit. It is highly concrete, rooted in the Montgomery struggle and the history of American slavery. It avoids generalities by naming specific actors and the zeitgeist of the civil rights movement.",
      "quotes": [
        "Far back in the slave quarters our fathers and mothers hummed softly",
        "We are committed in Montgomery to the faith",

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "While the sermon is not 'boring,' the interwovenness is lopsided because exposition is nearly absent. The hearer is drawn into the contemporary struggle, but the text is not 'expounded' alongside the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "The cry is still heard in the land.",
        "Here a man and men and women with giant souls in youthful bodies have led some people toward the way of Calvary"

      "findings": "The categories of misery (slavery, oppression) and redemption (Calvary, resurrection) are present. However, the 'gratitude' part is somewhat merged into the struggle itself rather than being a distinct response to grace.",
      "quotes": [
        "I'm so glad trouble don't last always.",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon addresses the 'two ways' primarily in terms of temporal loss or gain—the choice between the 'arms of men' and the 'sword of the spirit.' The ultimate seriousness of being lost is present but leans heavily toward the collective/temporal.",
      "quotes": [

      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon emphasizes the universality of grace and the necessity of the life of Christ for righteousness. It points to salvation outside the self.",

        "suspended our participation in the life of Christ.",
        "Jesus did not go to his Calvary for his disciples alone.",
        "man is ultimately detached from himself and pointed to salvation outside himself."

      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The text is far too short to meet Dekker's requirement. At approximately 340 words, it lacks the 'breadth' necessary for homiletical depth. It functions more as an exhortation or a speech fragment than a sermon.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the sermon to at least 2000 words to allow for the 'sleeping' dogmas and exegesis to provide necessary depth."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text falls short of Dekker's definition of a sermon primarily due to its lack of a single specific Bible passage and its insufficient length. It operates as a thematic address where the Bible serves the contemporary narrative rather than the text being recreated into a current word. While the application is concrete and Christ is the telos, the lack of formal exegesis and the brevity prevent it from achieving the 'present of revelation' Dekker describes.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application to the specific social and psychological reality of the congregation.",
      "Strong Christocentric focus on the universality of grace.",
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' (misery/redemption) within a historical framework."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of a single underlying pericope; uses the Bible as a source of keywords.",
      "Absence of original language exegesis or historical-critical depth.",
      "Duration is significantly below the 20-minute threshold required for depth."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "According to Dekker's criteria, this is not a sermon. It is a powerful religious speech or 'actualization of a biblical idea,' but it lacks the formal requirement of being an 'exposition and application of a specific Bible passage' with the necessary breadth of 20 minutes."
