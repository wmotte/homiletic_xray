    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon employs a central contemporary metaphor—the Ford 'Go Further' slogan—to anchor its theological claim. This provides a recognizable, sensory hook for the listener. However, the imagery remains largely functional rather than evocative. While it mentions the 'stench' of old purity codes implicitly through the Peter narrative, it lacks the deep, textured 'painting' of the biblical scene recommended by Paul Scott Wilson. The imagery of the 'nightmare' is a strong choice, framing revelation as something unsettling rather than merely informative. Yet, the sermon leans more on rhetorical repetition of the 'Go further' imperative than on building a rich visual world for the hearer to inhabit.",

        "the new mantra of the Ford Motor Company now featured in its current ads, 'Go further.'",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise and avoids traditional 'Canaanite' jargon by using sociological and psychological terms like 'tribalism,' 'exceptionalism,' and 'purity codes.' This demonstrates stewardship of language (McEntyre) by making ancient concepts accessible to a modern mind. The preacher is careful to distinguish between 'apostle' as a noun and an adjective, showing an interest in the weight of words. The sentence structure is lean and economical. However, the list of 'Go further' imperatives at the end borders on generalization, losing some of the precision established in the first half of the text.",

        "They are not custodians, or managers, or caretakers, or bureaucrats.",

      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Religious jargon is minimal; the preacher uses 'purity codes' and 'ecumenism' which are academic but clearly situated within the argument."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a distinct rhetorical cadence, particularly through the use of anaphora ('Go further about...', 'Go further beyond...'). This creates a driving rhythm that mirrors the theme of movement. The sentences are generally short and punchy, suitable for oral delivery. There is a nice contrast between the longer explanatory sentences at the start and the staccato imperatives at the end. It avoids 'paper language' by using direct address and conversational interjections ('As I thought about...', 'It turned out...'). The repetition of 'Go further' acts as a rhythmic refrain that aids memorability.",
      "quotes": [
        "Go further in courage about the economy... Go further in freedom about serious ecumenism... Go further about othering...",
        "They are not custodians, or managers, or caretakers, or bureaucrats.",

        "Strong use of anaphora to build momentum.",
        "Effective use of lists (asyndeton) to create a sense of weight and variety.",

      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The rhythm becomes somewhat predictable by the third 'Go further' in the list.",
        "Could use more variation in sentence length to allow for 'breathing' between the imperatives.",
        "The ending is a bit abrupt, missing a final 'legato' moment to balance the 'staccato' commands."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "This is clearly oral language designed for performance and impact."
    },
    "average_score_language": 6.67,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a strong, rhythmic quality with a clear 'stewardship of language.' It avoids religious clichés in favor of sharp, contemporary terminology that challenges the hearer. While the central Ford metaphor is effective for accessibility, the imagery lacks the sensory depth required for a truly 'cinematic' sermon. The language is more rhetorical and persuasive than poetic, focusing on the 'sending' impulse through repetition. It is a text that sounds better than it reads, which is a hallmark of good homiletical musicality, though it occasionally sacrifices nuance for the sake of its rhythmic 'mantra'."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear movement from the definition of 'apostle' to the disruption of the 'nightmare' and finally to the contemporary application. There is an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' when the preacher introduces the conflict between the Jewish purity codes and the Spirit's expansion. However, the 'plot' (Lowry) is somewhat truncated. The tension of the Acts 15 council is resolved very quickly, moving almost immediately into a list of modern applications. The 'turning point'—Peter's realization of grace—is stated but not fully dramatized, leading to a conclusion that feels more like a series of exhortations than a narrative resolution.",
      "quotes": [
        "All of that worked until Peter had his nightmare",
        "Thus by chapter 15 the advocates of the old holiness codes are stirring the pot.",

        "Clear movement from the biblical past to the contemporary present.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "Dwell longer on the 'pot-stirring' conflict to increase the narrative tension.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. The preacher masterfully 'reframes' (Cilliers) the ancient purity codes of Acts 15 as modern 'tribalism' and 'exceptionalism.' By using the Ford slogan, the preacher bridges the gap between the biblical world and the world of the hearer in a way that feels both surprising and inevitable. The 'nightmare' of Peter is integrated with the 'nightmare' of modern economic and social 'othering.' It respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the mother/Leviticus anecdote) while making it immediately relevant to the hearer’s own 'zones of safety.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Peter undoubtedly learned the purity codes from his mother; it turned out that his mother was wrong, and yours probably was as well.",
        "Go further in freedom about serious ecumenism that violates our safe tribalism",
        "The Spirit is restless with our tribal closures."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of ancient purity laws as modern social boundaries.",
        "The 'mother' anecdote provides a powerful, relatable bridge for the concept of tradition.",
        "The sermon successfully moves the hearer from 'then' to 'now' without losing the text's edge."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition from the Ford ad to the Bible could be more nuanced.",
        "The reference to Psalm 122 in the title is entirely unintegrated into the text.",
        "Could explore the 'grace' vs. 'purity' tension more deeply in the modern context."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing is present; the sermon offers a new lens to view contemporary social 'closures' through the Acts narrative."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "While the sermon uses the language of 'going further' into 'new territory,' the structure itself is somewhat closed. The list of imperatives ('Go further in courage...', 'Go further in freedom...') functions more as a set of directives than as an 'open work of art' (Stark). The preacher tells the congregation exactly where they need to go further (economy, ecumenism, othering). While these are prophetic, they leave little room for the hearer to discover their own 'new territory.' The ending is a command ('Hear what the Spirit is saying... Go further!') rather than an invitation or an open-ended question that invites reflection.",
      "quotes": [
        "Go further in courage about the economy, because who else will speak?",
        "It requires apostolic preaching to get there, to get beyond zones of safety and comfort",
        "Hear what the Spirit is saying to the apostolic church: 'Go further!'"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The sermon acknowledges the 'ambivalence' of breaking with a trusted past.",
        "The use of 'nightmare' suggests a revelation that is not easily managed.",
        "The focus on 'grace' provides a theological opening beyond mere moralism."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Use more open-ended questions to allow the hearer to identify their own 'purity codes'.",
        "Avoid the 'laundry list' of applications which can feel prescriptive.",
        "End with an image or a question that lingers rather than a repeated imperative."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent and directive; it functions as a prophetic call rather than an open interpretive space."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon's structure is a effective vehicle for its prophetic message, excelling in the 'reframing' of biblical conflict for a modern audience. It moves with purpose from the 'nightmare' of Peter to the 'tribalism' of the modern church. However, the dramaturgy suffers from a premature transition into a list of imperatives, which closes the 'open work' and turns the sermon into a series of commands. While the integration of text and context is superior, the narrative arc is sacrificed for rhetorical force, resulting in a structure that is more 'declarative' than 'exploratory'."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'cheap comfort' and 'happy endings,' instead focusing on 'nightmares,' 'controversy,' and the 'risky truth of the gospel.' By challenging the hearer's 'safe tribalism' and 'passionate exceptionalism,' it eschews the pre-chewed emotions often found in sentimental preaching. The anecdote about the mother being 'wrong' is a sharp, anti-kitsch moment that punctures the sentimentality often associated with Mother's Day. It deals with 'authentic emotion' (the fear of losing one's certitudes) rather than 'sentiment' (clichéd religious joy).",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The Ford 'Go further' slogan is a borderline 'pop-culture' cliché, but it is used subversively here.",
      "None significant."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission that 'Peter’s mother was wrong, and yours probably was as well.'",
      "The description of revelation as a 'nightmare' rather than a 'dream'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this sharp, subversive edge; it is the sermon's strongest aesthetic defense against the 'kitsch' of comfortable religion."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon explicitly mentions grace as the 'contrary' reality that saves us, which opens a 'space for grace' (Cilliers) by moving beyond human effort. However, the heavy use of imperatives ('Go further!') creates a counter-pressure of moralization. The 'space' is opened theologically but somewhat closed rhetorically by the demand for 'courage' and 'freedom.' The 'restless Spirit' is a powerful image of grace that is not a 'possession' but a 'movement,' which respects the mystery of God's action.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between 'old settlements' and 'new territory' are well-sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the Spirit's 'restlessness' is respected, though the applications are quite specific.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace is the foundation, but the sermon's 'tone' leans toward a moral/prophetic imperative.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'grace' section (v. 11) more room to breathe so the 'sending' feels like a response to a gift rather than a new law."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of 'Prophetic-Reframing' aesthetics. Its primary beauty lies in its intellectual and social 'soberness' and its refusal to hide behind religious jargon. It functions as a sharp 'optics' (Cilliers) that forces the hearer to see their own social boundaries in the light of the Acts narrative. Aesthetically, it is a 'lean' work—economical, rhythmic, and direct. It avoids the 'baroque excess' of over-explanation and the 'kitsch' of easy comfort. However, it falls short of the highest aesthetic scores because it prioritizes 'telling' and 'commanding' over 'showing' and 'inviting.' The lack of sensory imagery and the shift into a directive list at the end limits its power as an 'open work of art.' It is a sermon of the 'Word' that uses rhetoric effectively but misses the 'poetic' depth that would allow the hearer to truly 'inhabit' the new territory it describes.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional 'reframing' of ancient purity codes into contemporary social critiques.",
      "Complete absence of religious kitsch and sentimentality.",
      "Strong rhetorical rhythm and 'stewardship of language' that makes the text accessible."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase 'sensory imagery' to balance the abstract rhetorical commands.",
      "Shift from a 'list of imperatives' to a more 'open' narrative conclusion.",
      "Integrate the 'Psalm 122' reference or remove it to ensure structural coherence."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Reframing (Sober-Reformed edge)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Anti-kitsch) and Walter Brueggemann (Prophetic imagination/rhetoric).",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who are intellectually engaged and weary of 'pious' language; those open to social critique and 'sober' theological reflection.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Practice 'show, don't tell' by describing a specific moment of 'going further' in detail.",
      "Experiment with ending on a question or a lingering image rather than an imperative.",
      "Deepen the 'musicality' by varying sentence length more intentionally during the climax."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a highly effective piece of rhetorical communication that successfully bridges the gap between text and context. It excels in its 'anti-kitsch' stance and its precise use of language to challenge 'tribal closures.' While it lacks the 'cinematic' imagery and 'interpretive openness' of a model aesthetic sermon, it remains a compelling example of how a preacher can 'steward' language to create a 'space for grace' that is both unsettling and necessary. It is a 6.5—a solid, 'good' sermon that performs its task with clarity and prophetic edge, but has room to grow in its poetic and dramaturgical depth."
