    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The imagery is predominantly socio-political and collective rather than sensory or individual. While it evokes the 'stench' of injustice through references to Soweto and the 'fruits of the land,' it remains largely within the realm of sociological categories. The preacher uses 'Soweto' as a metonymy for oppression, which is powerful but functions more as a political signifier than a poetic image. There is a lack of 'painting the scene' of the biblical text itself; the focus is on the 'historical place' of the interpretation. The metaphors used (e.g., 'trick of the bourgeoisie') are ideological rather than aesthetic, serving to clarify a front rather than open a world of wonder.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is intellectually sharp and precise in its polemics. There is a clear 'stewardship of language' in the way it deconstructs the phrase 'for all,' exposing it as a potential 'trick.' However, the sermon is heavily laden with Marxist and liberation-theological jargon ('Bourgeoisie,' 'Klassenkämpfe,' 'interklassizistische Exegese'). While precise within its own framework, this language risks becoming a new 'Canaanite' dialect that excludes those outside the specific ideological circle. The precision here is more surgical/analytical than 'loving' in the sense of McEntyre; it seeks to divide truth from lie with a sharp edge.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a rhetorical rhythm characterized by antithesis and repetition. The series of 'The spirit that... cannot be the spirit of...' creates a driving, almost litany-like cadence. This 'staccato' of demands and exclusions gives the text a prophetic urgency. However, it lacks 'legato'—there are no moments of rest or poetic lingering. It is a 'marching' text. The musicality is that of a protest song or a manifesto: rhythmic, percussive, and aimed at mobilization rather than contemplation. It is clearly 'oral' in its persuasive intent but 'paper-like' in its conceptual density.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 5.67,
    "summary_language": "The language is rhetorically powerful but aesthetically restricted by its ideological focus. It excels in 'prophetic' precision and rhythmic antithesis, effectively deconstructing 'cheap' universalism. However, it suffers from a high density of sociological jargon and a lack of sensory imagery. It functions more as a 'word of power' in a political sense than a 'word of beauty' in a poetic sense. The stewardship of language is directed toward truth-telling in a culture of lies, yet it risks creating its own 'closed' linguistic system."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a logical-argumentative arc rather than a narrative one. It begins with a 'historical location' (the upsetting of the equilibrium), moves through a series of provocations regarding who the text is 'for,' and ends with a call to solidarity. There is a clear 'turning point' where the focus shifts from 'them' (the Third World) to 'us' (the rich). However, the 'plot' is predictable for those familiar with the genre. It lacks the 'Lowry loop' of ambiguity; it moves directly from problem to ideological solution. The tension is high, but it is the tension of a debate rather than a story.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. It exemplifies Cilliers' 'reframing.' It takes a well-known biblical text and forces the hearer to see it through the lens of Soweto and global capitalism. It resists the 'smoothing over' of the text's radicality. The synthesis between the 'Year of the Lord' and the 'abolition of class society' is provocative and organic within the preacher's framework. It honors the 'strangeness' of the gospel by making it strange to the 'bourgeois' hearer. It is a masterclass in contextual homiletics, even if one disagrees with the specific frame.",
      "quotes": [
        "Der Befreier... kann nicht gut der Erhalter bestehender Ordnung sein",
        "Das Evangelium steht nicht über den Klassenkämpfen, sondern mitten in ihnen",

      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing. It shifts the frame from 'universal spiritual comfort' to 'partisan political liberation'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "Aesthetically, this is a 'closed' work. It leaves very little room for polyvalence or the 'ambivalence of existence.' The interpretation is monovalent: the text is for the poor, and for the rich only through critique/solidarity. While this provides clarity, it lacks the 'openness' Stark advocates for. The hearer is not a conversation partner but a subject to be confronted or mobilized. There is no room for doubt, mystery, or the 'not yet' of grace that transcends class. It is a 'sealed' system of truth that demands a 'yes' or 'no' response, leaving little space for the 'between'.",
      "quotes": [
        "eine klassenneutrale Auslegung dieses Textes [ist] unmöglich",
        "Dieser Text ist für die Armen geschrieben, nicht »für alle«.",

        "Acknowledge the 'mystery' of how God works across human divisions."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Monovalent/Closed. It is a 'coercive schema' (in Stark's terms) aimed at a specific ideological realization."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 5.67,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is a powerful argumentative arc that excels in contextual 'reframing' but fails in 'openness.' It successfully breaks the 'fixed frames' of the hearer (Cilliers) but replaces them with a rigid ideological frame that leaves little room for interpretation or the 'inter-esse.' The dramaturgy is that of a prophetic confrontation—effective for mobilization, but aesthetically 'closed' as a work of art. It moves with purpose but lacks the 'space' for the hearer to inhabit the text in diverse ways."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is the antithesis of religious kitsch. It ruthlessly exposes 'cheap comfort' and 'pre-chewed emotions.' By attacking the 'trick' of universalizing poverty ('we are all poor before death'), it rejects the 'happy ending' and the 'sentimental' Jesus. It takes the pain of Soweto and the reality of class struggle with absolute seriousness. There is no 'beautifying writing' here; the aesthetics are 'sober-Reformed' in their iconoclastic rejection of religious decoration. It is an 'authentic' cry for justice that refuses to resolve tensions cheaply.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'trick' of saying 'we are all poor before God' to avoid economic responsibility.",
      "The 'unspecific for all' that obscures the reality of the oppressed."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The insistence that the 'year of the Lord' must cost the 'capital owners' their dividends.",
      "The definition of grace for the rich as 'critique and self-critique'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this rigor, but ensure that the 'anti-kitsch' stance doesn't lead to a 'cynical' aesthetics that forgets the 'beauty' of the promise itself."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 5,
    "analysis": "The 'space for grace' is paradoxically both opened and closed. It is opened in the sense that it clears away the 'kitsch' that blocks true encounter with the Holy as the God of the oppressed. However, it is closed by its 'conditional' nature ('Only if we... then...'). Grace becomes a reward for solidarity rather than an 'unavailable' gift. The 'mystery' is largely explained away through socio-economic analysis. There is little room for the 'vertical' dimension of revelation that Thurneysen emphasized; the focus is almost entirely horizontal.",
    "tension_sustained": "Sustains the tension between 'rich' and 'poor' but resolves the theological tension through political action.",
    "mystery_respected": "Low. The text is treated as a transparent blueprint for social change.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Moralization (in the form of political ethics) prevails over the 'pure gift' of grace.",
    "recommendation": "Reintroduce the 'vertical' dimension—the 'Space for Grace' that exists even when human solidarity fails, to avoid making the gospel a new Law."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 5.8,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a 'Prophetic-Political' aesthetic that prioritizes 'truth-telling' and 'reframing' over 'beauty' and 'openness.' Its primary aesthetic value lies in its iconoclasm—its ability to shatter the 'kitsch' of middle-class religiosity. It uses the 'aesthetic turn' not to beautify the message, but to make the 'form' of the sermon match the 'form' of a partisan, liberating Word. While it is rhetorically powerful and contextually brilliant, it lacks the 'polyvalence' and 'musicality' that would make it an 'open work of art.' It is a 'closed' work that functions as a spiritual-political intervention. The 'sober beauty' here is found in its radical honesty and its refusal to offer cheap grace.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the biblical text within a concrete global context (Soweto/Capitalism).",
      "Total absence of religious kitsch and sentimentalism.",
      "Rhetorical urgency and rhythmic drive in its prophetic critique."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Over-reliance on ideological jargon ('Bourgeoisie', 'interklassizistisch') which dates the text and limits its aesthetic reach.",
      "Lack of 'openness' and 'polyvalence'; the sermon is too monovalent and prescriptive.",
      "The 'conditional' framing of grace ('Only if...') risks turning the gospel into a new legalistic requirement."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Materialist / Sober-Iconoclastic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers' concept of 'Reframing' and 'Anti-Kitsch', but lacks Ciska Stark's 'Openness' and Paul Scott Wilson's 'Imagery'. It aligns with the 'Ethical' turn in language care (McEntyre) but focuses on justice rather than reconciliation.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'activist' hearers and those disillusioned with traditional church language, but may alienate those seeking 'consolatio' or 'mystery'.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Incorporate more sensory 'imagery' from the biblical text to balance the abstract political categories.",
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer in the 'space between' the text and the world.",
      "Use more 'loving language' (McEntyre) to describe the possibility of transformation, even for the 'rich'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically 'hard' text. It succeeds in its mission to be a 'stumbling block' to a comfortable audience, utilizing the power of language to unmask ideology. However, from the perspective of the 'aesthetic turn,' it is somewhat one-dimensional. It sacrifices 'beauty' and 'mystery' for 'clarity' and 'justice.' It is a highly effective 'event' (Immink) of confrontation, but as a 'work of art,' it is more of a political poster than a multi-layered painting. Its value lies in its 'reframing' power, which remains a vital aesthetic task in homiletics."
