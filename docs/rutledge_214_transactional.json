It respects the listener's intelligence and skepticism while presenting a clear theological conviction. By using the 'terrorist infrastructure' metaphor, it connects internal psychological reality (Sin/Death) with external reality without falling into the 'Ain't It Awful' game. It promotes autonomy by emphasizing that Resurrection is an act of God that 'calls into existence' new possibilities, rather than a burden for the human to achieve.",
