  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely avoids the manipulative traps common in pastoral transitions. By utilizing a strong Adult ego position, the preacher deconstructs the 'Hero-Rector' myth and the 'Dependent-Congregation' dynamic. She uses the text to set realistic expectations, acknowledging that conflict is inevitable without shaming the listeners for it. The primary psychological movement is from a potential Parent-Child dependency toward an Adult-Adult shared vocation.",
    "strengths": [
      "Use of humor to engage the Free Child.",
      "Adult-level reality testing regarding parish life.",
      "Avoidance of the 'NIGYSOB' game despite the text's focus on complaining."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The preemptive warning about 'murmuring' could be perceived as a Critical Parent 'finger-wag' during a moment of genuine joy.",
      "Slightly more Free Child/Spontaneity could balance the heavy emphasis on 'burden' and 'weariness'."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' to maintain Adult-Adult equality. When warning about future conflict, frame it as a natural systemic process rather than a moral failure to avoid triggering the Adapted Child's guilt."
