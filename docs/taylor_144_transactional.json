    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is rhetorically powerful but psychologically coercive. It operates primarily from a Critical Parent position that seeks to dismantle the listener's Adult ego (their sense of reality, location, and self-adjustment) to induce a state of 'Adapted Child' submission. While it uses beautiful imagery (Free Child), this serves as a 'Con' to lead the listener into a 'Bait & Switch' game where grace is replaced by the demand for total self-negation ('I am wrong').",
    "strengths": [
      "High aesthetic and poetic quality (Free Child appeal).",
      "Effective use of historical narrative to engage the Adult ego initially."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Heavy reliance on shaming 'respectability' and 'intelligence'.",
      "Creation of a dependency loop where the listener must be 'saved each day'."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the listener's Adult ego as a partner in the faith journey rather than an opponent to be 'troubled'. Instead of telling them they are lonely, ask them to reflect on their own experience of God. Move from 'You must humble yourself' (CP) to 'How do we respond to this mystery?' (A)."
