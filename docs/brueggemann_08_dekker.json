  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon stays close to the pericope of John 20:19-23, structured around the four 'assertions' of Jesus. It avoids wandering into general biblical ideas. However, it fails Dekker's 'nowhere else' test; the themes of peace, mission, and Spirit are treated as general theological categories rather than being derived from the unique Johannine context of the 'locked doors' as a specific theological locus.",
      "quotes": [
        "The very next phrase gets to the action: 'Jesus came and stood among them and said to them' (v. 19, RSV).",
        "On this Pentecost day, here are four words for you."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify what is unique about John's account of the Spirit (the 'Johannine Pentecost') compared to Acts, rather than harmonizing them."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is thin. While it mentions the 'Jewish greeting,' it lacks the depth of Hebrew/Greek linguistic nuance or the specific historical-theological tension of the Johannine community. The preacher treats the text more as a narrative 'stage setting' for a speech than a document requiring rigorous exposition of original meaning.",
      "quotes": [
        "To be sure, the phrase is only a Jewish greeting.",
        "We do not know how he got there, how he penetrated behind shut doors."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the specific Johannine theology of the 'sent' Son (pempō/apostellō) and the significance of the wounds in the context of the first-century witness."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application attempts concreteness by mentioning Lithuania, South Africa, and health care in Congress. However, these feel like a list of 'general' contemporary topics rather than a specific 'application' that arises from the text's unique logic. It borders on the 'general truths' Dekker forbids.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is blowing in Lithuania and in South Africa, and in Nicaragua and Camp David.",
        "If you are liberal, Jesus may be sending you to policy questions... If you are conservative, Jesus may be sending you to sharing."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move away from political categories (liberal/conservative) and apply the 'locked doors' metaphor to the specific psychological or spiritual state of the actual congregation present."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon succeeds well in mixing exposition and application. The preacher does not separate the 'then' from the 'now' into distinct blocks; rather, the movement of Jesus into the room is simultaneously presented as his movement into the hearer's life.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus comes to the cowering church and says, 'Peace be with you' (v. 19).",
        "The Jesus who says the word brings the reality of what he says. He is like the person you trust the most."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'exposition' side of the mix is more theologically robust so the application has more 'weight' to carry."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'misery' (fear, locked doors, lethargy) is clearly the background. 'Redemption' is found in the intrusive presence of Christ. 'Gratitude' is framed as the 'mission' or 'sending.' It follows the 3-2-1 rule implicitly, though the 'misery' could be more sharply defined as sin rather than just 'fearfulness.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The doors were intended to keep people out, but Jesus came and disrupted their safe hiding.",
        "The curse of unforgiveness leads to abuse and dehumanization."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' section by addressing the 'unforgiveness' not just as a social ill, but as a theological state of being lost before God."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on the 'two ways' by mentioning the 'vicious cycles of death' and 'destruction.' However, it lacks the 'ultimate' seriousness Dekker demands. The possibility of being eternally lost is absent; the focus is primarily on 'temporal loss' (society perishing).",
      "quotes": [
        "Unforgivenness leads to death, both for the victim and for the perpetrator.",
        "If, however, we do not go, we can forget about his offer of peace."

      "improvement_point": "Articulate the consequence of refusing the 'sending' in more than just psychological or social terms; address the 'ultimate possibilities' of the life design."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon emphasizes that these are things 'only Jesus can say.' The focus on the 'lordly one' and 'magisterial speech' points toward the divinity of Christ (two natures), and grace is the underlying engine of the 'gate-crashing.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus takes over the meeting. He dominates the room.",
        "They are four things only Jesus can say."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly link the 'peace' offered to the 'atonement' (the wounds), making the grace even more 'outside ourselves' (extra nos)."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1,250 words, the sermon would likely take 12-13 minutes to deliver. According to Dekker's Thesis 8, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for true depth. It moves too quickly through four major points.",
      "improvement_point": "The sermon needs at least 8-10 more minutes of substantive theological and exegetical 'breadth' to achieve the 'depth' Dekker requires."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short primarily in its brevity and lack of rigorous academic exegesis. It functions more as a rhetorical encouragement than a 'recreation of the Word' through deep study. While it avoids being a 'speech about refugees' by staying with the text, its application remains somewhat general and its duration is significantly below the 20-minute threshold for 'depth.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christocentric focus where Jesus is the sole actor and initiator.",
      "Effective interwoven structure that prevents the sermon from becoming a dry lecture.",
      "Clear identification of the 'misery' of the fearful, locked-in church."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (approx. 12 minutes) fails the 'depth needs breadth' criterion.",
      "Lack of original language engagement or historical-critical depth.",
      "Application relies on a list of general global issues rather than concrete congregational reality."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'weak' sermon by Dekker's standards. It has the correct 'formal' structure (exposition and application mixed), but it lacks the 'bicycle mechanic's' precision in exegesis and the necessary 'breadth' of time to truly unfold the mystery of the specific passage."
