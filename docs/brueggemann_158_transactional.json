    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and promotes autonomy. It avoids the traps of religious manipulation by speaking from an Adult ego state and inviting the listeners to do the same. By deconstructing the 'Pharaoh' script (scarcity, fear, violence), the preacher helps the listener recognize their own 'Adapted Child' responses and offers the 'Free Child's' creativity and joy as a theological alternative. The use of names (Shiphrah/Puah) versus the nameless 'system' (Pharaoh) reinforces the value of individual and communal personhood over institutional conformity.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "Empowers the listener's agency rather than creating dependency.",
      "Clear identification of dysfunctional 'scripts' (scarcity/anxiety)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Say Shiphrah!' command could briefly trigger an Adapted Child response (compliance) if not handled with the intended playfulness.",
      "Ensure the 'we' includes the preacher's own struggle with conformity to avoid a subtle 'I'm OK, You're Not OK' dynamic."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' and 'us' to maintain the Adult-Adult level and prevent the congregation from feeling 'persecuted' by the critique of the political economy."
