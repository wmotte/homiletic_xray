Sie läuft noch in der Nacht nach der Bestattung zum Grab Jesu und sieht, dass der Stein, der die Grabkammer verschlossen hat, fehlt. Sie wollte den Leichnam Jesu sehen und ehren und ist nun entsetzt [...] Liebe Schwestern, ihr werdet neue Kraft empfangen, eure Füße werden wie von selbst laufen, und euch werden Flügel wachsen wie den Adlern. Ihr werdet die Männer mitreißen. Wenn ihr mutlos werdet und euch in die Gräber hinabbeugt, dann dreht euch um und seht auf Christus, den Auferstandenen. Er ist bei euch.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience through high emotional identification with Maria Magdalena's grief. It avoids abstract 'sorrow' by grounding it in physical sensations and historical-political parallels (South Africa, Chernobyl). The hearer is not just a listener but a co-mourner at the grave. The use of Sölle's poetry bridges the biblical text with the immediate emotional reality of the congregation.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Reflective observation is achieved through a critical analysis of why the world is in its current state. The sermon pauses to ask why we have stopped weeping and why we resign. It offers a cultural critique of the 'logic of death' (capitalism, nuclear power) and reflects on the tragic history of Christian anti-Judaism. It moves beyond the 'what' to the 'why' of human and systemic failure.",

      "analysis": "Theological depth is present but often subordinated to political ethics. The 'big idea' is the 'Macht der Auferstehung' (Power of Resurrection) as a counter-power to death. Exegesis is solid regarding the Roman context and the role of women, but dogmatic deepening is often replaced by metaphorical language (the 'X-factor'). It challenges traditional concepts (God as Father) but offers 'Resurrection' more as a socio-political category than a metaphysical one.",

It moves from the 'vision' to concrete, albeit radical, lifestyle changes: self-sufficiency, baking bread, halving work hours, and political activism. It avoids generalities by naming specific groups (ANC, peace movement) and specific actions (handling waste, asylum work). It invites the hearer to 'spread the resurrection' through concrete socio-economic alternatives.",

    "summary": "This sermon is a robust example of experiential homiletics that successfully integrates the four phases of Kolb's cycle, though with a distinct bias toward the 'feeling' and 'doing' poles. It begins with a deep, concrete immersion into the grief of Maria Magdalena, which serves as a mirror for the political and existential despair of the 1980s. The reflective phase is strong, offering a sharp critique of 'death-logic' and cynicism. The theological conceptualization redefines resurrection not as a past event but as a present 'counter-power'. Finally, it lands in very specific, radical applications. While the theological 'Abstract Conceptualization' is less about traditional dogma and more about political metaphor, the sermon effectively moves the hearer through a complete learning process from lament to action.",

      "Explore the 'Concrete Experience' of joy or peace to balance the focus on lament",
      "Provide a clearer 'logical bridge' between the biblical text and modern economic theories"
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a powerful, integrated piece of homiletical work that takes the Kolb cycle seriously. It excels in touching the 'heart' and 'hands' of the hearer, making the biblical text urgently relevant to a specific historical moment. Its primary diagnostic priority for improvement would be to strengthen the 'head' (Abstract Conceptualization) by offering a more robust theological framework that can withstand its own radical political weight. It is a model of 'prophetic-pragmatic' preaching that avoids the pitfall of abstract idealism by grounding every vision in a concrete 'how-to'."
