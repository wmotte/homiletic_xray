    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and largely game-free. It operates primarily from a Nurturing Parent position, offering security and grace, balanced with an Adult explanation of doctrine. It avoids the Drama Triangle by not creating a 'villain' or 'persecutor' (even when discussing the adult baptism debate). The primary risk is 'smothering' NP energy that might keep the congregation in a perpetual state of 'infant-like' dependency on grace without moving toward Adult accountability.",

      "The 'Free Child' could be more spontaneous and less tied to liturgical clichés.",
      "The transition from 'you have to do nothing' to 'your task as parents' is a sharp shift from NP to CP that could be better integrated."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To maintain this high level of health, continue to invite the congregation's Adult ego to reflect on the 'why' of the faith, ensuring that 'grace' is presented as a foundation for Adult action rather than a reason for Child passivity."
