By utilizing a strong Adult ego state to provide historical and theological context, the preacher bypasses the typical Parent-Child dynamics found in many sermons. He successfully reframes the congregation's potential 'Victim' status (as a 'small' or 'declining' mainline church) into a 'Free Child' state of hope and a 'Nurturing Parent' state of self-acceptance through the concept of 'The God of Small Things.'",

      "The brief 'Ain't It Awful' opening regarding the media could be seen as a minor 'Con' to build rapport through shared grievance."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize the 'Promise vs. Command' distinction, as this is the most effective way to prevent the congregation from slipping into the Adapted Child position."
