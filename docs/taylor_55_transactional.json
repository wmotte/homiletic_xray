    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically heavy and relies on shame-induction. While homiletically powerful, it functions by breaking down the listener's ego (Child) through Critical Parent judgments. It creates a 'double bind' where the listener is told they are a 'friend' of Jesus while simultaneously being labeled a 'betrayer' and 'slimy.' This promotes dependency and guilt rather than autonomous spiritual growth.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try moving to an Adult-Adult transaction. Instead of telling the congregation they are Judas, ask them to reflect on their own experiences of loyalty and failure. Replace 'must' and 'should' with 'how might we?' to invite the listener's Adult to process the reality of the text."
