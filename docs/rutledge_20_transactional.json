      "presence": "Medium",
      "analysis": "The preacher uses historical and contemporary data (Mexico, 9/11, biblical exegesis) to build a case. However, the heavy use of mythic combat imagery occasionally bypasses the Adult to speak directly to the Child's need for safety.",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 7,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically supportive, utilizing a strong Nurturing Parent ego state to provide security in a time of cultural anxiety. While it flirts with the 'Ain't It Awful' game by emphasizing a world 'with devils filled,' it avoids the most toxic homiletical games by refusing to turn the Critical Parent against the congregation. The primary psychological movement is from 'Helpless Victim' to 'Equipped Child/Soldier.'",

      "Heavy reliance on the Rescuer role can foster spiritual dependency.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward a more Adult-Adult transaction, ask the congregation more reflective questions that require them to process their own reality rather than just 'putting on' the provided imagery."
