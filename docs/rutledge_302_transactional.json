    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exceptionally healthy example of Adult-to-Adult communication. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the 'Critical Parent' by using self-disclosure and intellectual honesty. The preacher explicitly deconstructs manipulative 'games' (like the Bait & Switch of using heaven as a conversion tool) and instead presents faith as a reality-testing mechanism for dealing with both success and tragedy. The use of the Federici story provides a powerful emotional core without descending into sentimental manipulation, as it acknowledges the 'wrenching pain' alongside the hope.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of self-awareness and transparency.",
      "Rejection of manipulative 'conversion' tactics.",
      "Integration of current events with theological reflection without moralizing."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Slight risk of the 'Free Child' being overshadowed by the gravity of the examples.",
      "The critique of the 'successful people' parishioner, while effective, borders on a 'NIGYSOB' moment, though softened by his own admission of being seduced by success."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue the practice of 'we-statements' that include the preacher in the struggle. Maintain the Adult ego state when interpreting scripture to allow the congregation to reach their own conclusions."
