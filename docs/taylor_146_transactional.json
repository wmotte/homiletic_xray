    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of 'Prophetic Parent' rhetoric. It successfully processes a collective trauma (Adult) but quickly shifts into a guilt-inducing Critical Parent mode to drive social change. While it honors the victim, it risks overwhelming the listener with a sense of total complicity in a murder they did not commit. However, the final move toward the 'Free Child' resilience of the Ebenezer choir provides a healthy, autonomy-promoting conclusion.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to separate the sociological Adult analysis of gun laws from the moral Parent judgment of the listeners' hearts. Allow the congregation to grieve as 'Adults' before demanding 'Adapted Child' repentance."
