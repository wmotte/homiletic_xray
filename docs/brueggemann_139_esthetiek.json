    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in visual contrast, particularly in the description of Pilate's 'pageantry' versus Jesus' 'lack of credentials.' The imagery is cinematic, moving from the courtroom to the 'slave camps of Egypt' and the 'displaced exiles in Babylon.' Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don’t tell' is partially applied through the vivid description of the Roman governor’s entrance. However, the imagery occasionally shifts from sensory to sociological (e.g., 'white power', 'money power'), which flattens the poetic quality into political rhetoric. The most effective imagery appears at the end with the contrast between the 'broken bread' and the governor who 'swallowed the whole cup in one gulp.'",
      "quotes": [
        "maybe he entered the courtroom with drums and bugles, and imperial flags flying.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is deliberate and avoids traditional 'Canaanite' jargon, opting for a secular-political vocabulary to 'refame' the gospel. Marilyn Chandler McEntyre’s 'stewardship of language' is evident in the rhythmic repetitions. However, the precision suffers from broad generalizations. Terms like 'white power' and 'male power' are used as catch-all labels for 'empire,' which may lack the nuance required for a truly 'loving language' that does justice to the complexity of the hearer's identity. The precision is rhetorical rather than analytical.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest aesthetic feature. The text is highly rhythmic, utilizing parallelism and anaphora (e.g., 'This is the God who...'). The cadence is reminiscent of Hebrew poetry or the African American preaching tradition. The variation in sentence length—moving from short, declarative statements to longer, rolling litanies—creates a natural 'flow' that is clearly designed for oral delivery. The rhythm reinforces the 'dramaturgy' of the trial, building tension through repetition.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is a trial we get to remember tonight. It is a trial we get to observe... It is a trial in which we get to participate.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is rhetorically potent and highly rhythmic, functioning more like a dramatic script than a theological essay. It successfully avoids religious jargon, opting for a 'stewardship of language' that is contemporary and confrontational. While the imagery is vivid and the musicality is excellent, the precision is occasionally compromised by the use of broad sociological labels that border on new clichés. Overall, it is a strong example of 'prophetic poetics' that prioritizes impact and oral delivery over abstract nuance."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear dramaturgical progression, moving through four 'acts' or players. It begins by establishing the 'pivot point' (upsetting the equilibrium) and maintains tension by framing the trial as an ongoing event. The movement from the courtroom (Pilate/Jesus) to the external witnesses (Crowd/Disciples) expands the scope of the drama. However, the 'turning point' is somewhat diffused across the sections rather than being a singular, sharp moment. The conclusion successfully returns the 'verdict' to the hearer, completing the arc from observation to participation.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are, on this night, at the pivot point of the Jesus story.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This sermon is a masterclass in Johan Cilliers' 'reframing.' It takes the ancient trial of Jesus and frames it within modern power dynamics (money, greed, race, immigration). The integration is organic; the preacher doesn't just 'apply' the text at the end but allows the contemporary context to inform the reading of the biblical characters from the start. The 'strangeness' of Jesus—his lack of credentials—is highlighted as a direct challenge to modern imperial values. It offers a new frame where the 'last' are truly 'first.'",
      "quotes": [
        "He stands in, among us, for white power in its supremacy.",
        "The governor has lived so long with fake news that he did not know what to make of Jesus.",

        "Deepen the 'God of the covenant' section to provide more theological weight to the social claims."

      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing; the sermon provides a radical new lens to view both the Passion and modern society."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon claims to leave the 'verdict' to the hearer, the rhetorical structure is quite coercive. The categories are sharply drawn: you are either with the 'greedy/violent empire' or the 'vulnerable/merciful Jesus.' This binary limits the 'polyvalence' Stark advocates for. However, the ending is aesthetically 'open' in the sense that it leaves the hearer 'awaiting the verdict' and standing before the mystery of Jesus. It avoids a cheap 'happy ending' by remaining in the tension of Good Friday.",
      "quotes": [
        "His statements are enigmatic and we have to decide.",
        "We wait for a verdict this time.",
        "The verdict will not be long in coming."

        "Ends on a note of anticipation rather than a moralistic checklist.",
        "Acknowledges the 'enigmatic' nature of Jesus' teaching.",
        "Respects the 'Friday' space without rushing to Easter."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Allow for more 'ambivalence' in the characters (e.g., Pilate's confusion) to invite the hearer's own complexity.",
        "Reduce the 'us vs. them' binary to allow for more 'layers of meaning' for the hearer.",
        "The rhetorical questions in section IV are somewhat 'leading'—try more open-ended inquiries."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Structurally open at the end, but rhetorically monovalent in its moral/political categories."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon possesses a strong dramaturgical arc that effectively transforms the biblical trial into a contemporary event. Its greatest strength lies in 'reframing' the text, making the ancient narrative feel urgently present. While it avoids the 'static three-point' trap, its rhetorical force occasionally borders on the coercive, creating sharp binaries that may close off space for some hearers. Nevertheless, by refusing to resolve the tension of Good Friday prematurely, it maintains an aesthetic 'openness' that respects the 'event' of the cross."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully avoids religious kitsch. It does not offer 'immediate comfort' or 'pre-chewed emotions.' By focusing on the 'wounded' and 'despised' Jesus and the 'broken bread,' it takes the pain of the cross seriously. There is no 'happy ending' or clichéd 'Jesus is the answer' resolution. The use of political categories might feel 'trendy' to some, but it functions here as a way to ground the emotion in reality rather than sentimentality. It avoids the 'kitsch of the cross' by maintaining the harshness of the trial.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None significant, though the 'Lock him up' line flirts with the kitsch of political topicality.",
      "The 'drums and bugles' description is slightly theatrical but serves a purpose."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the disciples eating 'leftovers' in sadness.",
      "The portrayal of Jesus as 'all alone in the courtroom' without a phalanx of lawyers."

    "recommendation": "Maintain the focus on the 'brokenness' and 'vulnerability' to ensure the sermon stays grounded in authentic emotion rather than political sentiment."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'reframing' of power. By deconstructing 'imperial power,' the sermon creates a 'space for the Holy' to appear in the form of the vulnerable. However, the heavy emphasis on 'justice' and 'righteousness' as tasks can feel slightly moralistic, potentially closing the space for the 'unavailable' grace that Cilliers emphasizes. The 'space' is most open in the final image of the 'poured out wine'—a gift for those who have failed (like Peter).",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between empire and kingdom, and between despair and hope, are sustained until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of Jesus' identity ('He confused the governor') is respected and not fully 'explained away'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the 'God of the covenant' section, though moralization threatens in the 'Did he mean' litany.",
    "recommendation": "Lean further into the 'unavailability' of the verdict—that it is God's verdict on us, not just our verdict on Him."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'Prophetic-Narrative' preaching. It excels in its musicality and its ability to 'reframe' an ancient text for a contemporary audience. By utilizing the 'trial' as a dramaturgical framework, it moves the hearer from a passive observer to an active participant. The language is 'stewardly'—clear, rhythmic, and punchy—avoiding the 'Canaanite' jargon that often seals off sermons from the modern world. Its primary aesthetic achievement is the 'sober beauty' of the Good Friday narrative, refusing to bypass the 'broken bread' for a cheap Easter joy. While the sermon's rhetorical binaries and political specificity may occasionally close off 'polyvalence' for some, its commitment to 'authentic emotion' over 'religious kitsch' makes it a powerful 'event' in the sense of Immink's 'the holy happens.' It creates a 'space for grace' by identifying God with the vulnerable and the excluded, forcing a 'perception shift' (Cilliers) in how the hearer views power and truth.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional rhetorical rhythm and musicality (anaphora and parallelism).",
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the biblical trial within contemporary power structures.",
      "Avoidance of religious kitsch through a focus on vulnerability and 'brokenness'."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase nuance in sociological categories to avoid rhetorical 'closedness'.",
      "Balance 'telling' (political labels) with more 'showing' (sensory details of the passion).",

    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Narrative / Rhetorical-Reframing",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Kitsch) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Four Pages).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to hearers who value social relevance, rhythmic delivery, and a 'de-cluttered' theological language.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'poetic-contemplative' pace to contrast with the 'prophetic-urgent' pace.",
      "Use more 'living metaphors' from nature or daily life to supplement the political imagery.",
      "Try an 'open ending' that is a prayer rather than a declaration."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically strong performance that honors the 'event' of Good Friday. It avoids the pitfalls of 'paper language' and 'religious kitsch,' offering instead a 'sober beauty' that is both challenging and grounded. Its score of 7 reflects a high level of homiletical skill, particularly in the 'aesthetic turn' toward the hearer's reality, though it stops short of a 9 due to its occasionally coercive rhetorical binaries."
