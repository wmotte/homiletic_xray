It is characterized by a strong emphasis on Abstract Conceptualization, providing the hearer with a clear, intellectually satisfying framework for understanding the Epiphany season. It successfully advocates for the importance of 'big words' and orthodox Christology. However, it falls short in the Concrete Experience and Active Experimentation phases. There is a lack of connection to the hearer's daily life, and the application remains purely internal and reflective. The sermon assumes an 'Assimilating' learning style, which may alienate hearers who require narrative engagement or practical utility. While the 'Visionary' elements provide some inspiration, the absence of a 'Narrative' or 'Pragmatic' structure prevents the sermon from completing the homiletic cycle.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "From a Kolb perspective, this sermon is an 'incomplete cycle.' It excels in the intellectual and theoretical quadrants but fails to ground these insights in the lived experience of the listener or to move the listener toward concrete change. It is a strong example of 'Declarative' preaching that serves the 'Assimilating' learner well, but it lacks the holistic reach necessary for a diverse congregation. The priority for improvement is the integration of Concrete Experience and Active Experimentation to move the sermon from a lecture about the calendar to a transformative encounter with the Christ of the calendar."
