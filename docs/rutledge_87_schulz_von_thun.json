    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a robust historical-critical and socio-political framework. The 'Sache' is the apocalyptic theology as a 'thread' through Scripture. The exegesis of Daniel 5 is used as a typology for the Hellenistic crisis (Antiochus Epiphanes) and, by extension, the 1980s Cold War context. The theological depth is found in the definition of 'apocalypsis' not as end-time prediction, but as 'invasion' and 'unveiling.' However, the sermon leans heavily on historical lecturing in the first half, which risks turning the 'Blue' side into a classroom setting rather than a kerygmatic event. The Barthian 'Living Christ' is present but mediated through the lens of historical parallels.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a journey of intellectual conversion—from mocking 'bearded men with signs' to embracing apocalyptic theology. There is a clear 'Selbstenthüllung' of a former 'mainstream twentieth-century' academic who has been 're-trained.' The tone is authoritative yet admits to previous blindness. The 'I' is largely diaconal, serving to validate the difficulty of the text for the audience. However, there is a slight 'Hysterical' tendency in the dramatic repetition of 'There is a man!', which seeks to stir emotion through rhetorical flair rather than quiet testimony.",
      "quotes": [
        "I certainly never saw it until I was trained to look for it.",

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive/Schizoid blend. The preacher values structural correctness and historical data (Compulsive) but maintains a certain intellectual distance from the raw emotion of the martyrs, processing it through 'apocalyptic transvision' (Schizoid).",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching/Paternalistic.' The preacher speaks as the one who has 're-learned' to those who are 'here on the margins.' While there is an attempt at solidarity with the Catholic Worker movement, the distance remains that of a scholar addressing activists. The 'We-definition' is inclusive of the 'absorbed church' versus the 'faithful ones,' placing the preacher and the audience in the latter group. This creates a 'fortress' atmosphere which can be exclusionary to the 'uninitiated' or the 'compromised' listener.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The appeal is for 'endurance' and 'unveiled vision.' Theologically, the sermon balances Zuspruch (God's sovereignty) with Anspruch (the call to witness). However, the 'Red' side becomes heavy toward the end. The demand to be 'There was a man/woman!' functions as a moral imperative. The promise is that God rules, but the weight of the sermon lands on the human 'resistance movement.' The 'Barthian' acting subject (God) is occasionally eclipsed by the 'Hasidic' acting subject (the faithful human).",
      "quotes": [
        "The apocalyptic writings are 'a call for the endurance of the saints'.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a strong, intellectually rigorous sermon that successfully bridges the gap between ancient text and a specific radical context. Its primary strength lies in its 'Blue' side—the clarity with which it reclaims 'Apocalyptic' from the margins of 'bearded men' and places it at the center of political ethics. Theologically, it follows the Barthian tradition of God as the 'Wholly Other' who invades history. However, from a Schulz von Thun perspective, the 'Yellow' side is somewhat stiff; the preacher remains the 'Expert' throughout. The 'Green' side is authentic but controlled. The 'Red' side (Appeal) is powerful but risks tipping into a new Law of 'radicalism' where the listener's value is tied to their level of resistance. The sermon is a 'Satisfactory to Ample' example of homiletical teaching, but it lacks the 'Healing Disruption' of pure grace that would elevate it to an 8 or 9.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon avoids psychologization by focusing on God's sovereignty, but it risks 'politicizing' the revelation as a tool for the Catholic Worker's agenda.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "A disciplined, high-level communicative act that serves the 'Sache' well but maintains a psychological distance that may hinder existential 'touch' for the non-activist."
