    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates strong exegetical and historical competence. The 'Sache' is the Babylonian Exile as a 'theological emergency.' The transition from the local Salisbury fire to the 587 BC catastrophe is intellectually sharp. The preacher successfully introduces Second Isaiah and the concept of the Suffering Servant without becoming overly academic. However, the Barthian 'Living Christ' is largely mediated through Old Testament typology until the very end. The factual side is clear and provides a solid dogmatic framework for understanding God's sovereignty over history, though it risks becoming a history lecture in the middle section.",

        "The invasion, conquest, and exile of 587 was the greatest crisis in the history of the people.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a personality that values intellectual integrity and historical continuity. There is a sense of 'diaconal' self-revelation; the 'I' is used primarily to build a bridge (the Salisbury fire) rather than for self-aggrandizement. However, there is a subtle 'leaking' of cultural elitism (the disdain for Las Vegas/Southern California) which, while used as a rhetorical device, reveals a specific socio-cultural standpoint. The preacher appears as a guardian of the 'truth' against 'popular' optimism.",
      "quotes": [
        "I don’t know about you, but I think I would lose my mind if I were dragged off against my will to spend the rest of my days in Las Vegas.",
        "I had only been through town a few times, but even so, I was affected."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Schizoid. The preacher values structural correctness and historical distance. There is a clear preference for 'the truth' over 'non-committal warmth.'",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching' and 'Paternalistic.' The preacher places the congregation in the shoes of the 'heedless' Israelites. While the 'we' is used, there is a distinct distance between the 'prophetic' voice of the pulpit and the 'complacent' congregation. The tone is sober and somewhat demanding. The preacher assumes a position of authority, interpreting the congregation's potential resistance ('Would you and I want to hear it? Of course not.'). This creates a 'Yellow' signal of moral and intellectual superiority, even if intended as solidarity.",
      "quotes": [
        "The setting for the Babylonian invasion was one of heedless optimism... rather like America today.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily an appeal to *insight* and *endurance* rather than specific moral action. The preacher calls the congregation to recognize their own 'exile' and to reject 'false gods.' Theologically, the balance between Law (the threat of exile) and Gospel (the promise of Isaiah 43) is maintained, but the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) arrives late in the sermon. The appeal is for a 'restless faith' that refuses to be satisfied with the world as it is. It avoids crude moralism but places a heavy burden on the listener to 'be like Daniel.'",
      "quotes": [
        "If you don’t repent and return to the Lord... you are going to have to serve false gods.",
        "A satisfied Christian is a contradiction in terms.",

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward 'Anspruch' (the reality of exile/judgment) until the final third where 'Zuspruch' (God's love) takes over.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Moderate. The call to 'refuse to play the games' can be heard as a new law of asceticism.",

        "Strong rejection of 'cheap grace'.",
        "The final promise is rooted in God's character, not human effort."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a robust, intellectually demanding sermon that successfully bridges the gap between ancient text and contemporary context. It avoids the 'depressive' trap of non-committal warmth, opting instead for a 'compulsive' focus on the gravity of the 'Sache' (the Word of God). Theologically, it follows a Barthian trajectory by emphasizing God as the Acting Subject who 'blots out transgressions for His own sake.' However, the psychological reception is hampered by a somewhat elitist relational tone. The 'Las Vegas' analogy, while effective, risks pinning the 'revelation' down to the preacher's personal aesthetic preferences. The sermon excels in its refusal to offer easy answers to the problem of suffering, maintaining the tension of the 'Exile' until the final, powerful proclamation of Isaiah 43. It is a 'satisfactory to strong' performance that respects the intelligence of the congregation but perhaps keeps them at a distance.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon avoids psychologization by keeping the focus on God's historical action, but it flirts with 'culturalism'—substituting theological judgment with cultural critique.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Masterful use of analogy (Salisbury fire/Las Vegas).",
      "Theological depth regarding 'redemptive suffering'.",
      "Strong, uncompromised ending on the Promise."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Soften the 'paternalistic' relational signals.",
      "Integrate the 'Zuspruch' earlier to avoid a 'Law-heavy' first half.",
      "Ensure cultural critiques serve the Gospel, not just personal taste."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively honest and theologically serious sermon that challenges the hearer, though its 'Yellow' signals may create unnecessary barriers for some."
