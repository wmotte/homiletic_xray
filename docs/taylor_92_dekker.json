One feels here in Washington that he stands close to the nerve center of the political arrangements of the whole earth. [...] And now as I prepare to pass the standard of leadership on to other and more capable hands and turn to take my place loyally again in the ranks among Progressive Baptists, 'To Jesus Christ be glory and honor and thanksgiving and power and might for ever and ever'."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's first requirement. It is not an exposition of a specific passage but a topical address that uses Scripture as a 'keyword' or proof-text. The text (Luke 9:1) is introduced only after 1,400 words of institutional and political preamble. It does not seek what is unique to this text.",
      "quotes": [
        "I find it illuminating that Jesus called his disciples apart, as it is recorded in the ninth chapter of Luke.",
        "That theme of power recurs like a symphonic theme through Holy Writ. I count 155 times it is used."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one pericope (e.g., Luke 9:1-6) and make it the starting point, not a late-stage illustration for a sociological observation about separatism."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "There is no formal exegesis. The preacher does not engage with the original context of Luke 9, the mission of the Twelve, or the Greek nuances of 'dynamis' and 'exousia'. The text is immediately spiritualized and then politicized without historical grounding.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus must have seen that every group must at some time or the other get with itself, find itself."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Analyze the specific commission in Luke 9:1. What did 'power and authority' mean for the disciples in the context of the coming Kingdom of God, rather than modern 'Black Power'?"
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is the sermon's strongest point in a general sense, though Dekker would find it too 'sociological'. It is highly concrete regarding the zeitgeist (Vietnam, Civil Rights, denominational politics). However, the application is often detached from the specific Bible passage.",
      "quotes": [
        "America, what madness is upon you, that hearing the anguished cries of hunger from your own children you could be so unmoved...",
        "At Colgate Rochester Divinity School, I was steered to a separate section of the cafeteria by black students..."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The sermon is structurally fragmented. It begins with a long secular/institutional report, moves to a brief biblical 'hint', and then returns to application. There is no 'movement' where the hearer is expounded together with the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "I shall not dwell upon our desire to secure property... I have recently attended the Baptist World Alliance Executive Committee...",
        "The Scriptures suggest that the apartness into which Jesus led his disciples was redemptive..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Remove the administrative reports and institutional 'shout-outs'. Begin with the text and let the application emerge through the exposition."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'misery' is vividly depicted as societal and racial injustice. 'Redemption' is present but leans toward human empowerment. 'Gratitude' is expressed toward denominational leaders rather than as a theological response to the Spirit.",
      "quotes": [
        "Looking out upon the unfulfilled dream, the wasted years, the broken promises...",
        "We must bear tidings of redemption to earth's darkest places."

      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' to include the theological dimension of being 'lost before God' (Thesis 5), not just political deprivation."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on 'summary judgments' and the 'judgment of history', which aligns with Dekker's 'lost in time' (collective) tradition. However, the 'narrow way' is defined more by racial identity than by the radical following of Christ.",
      "quotes": [
        "...or else the God of history will act with summary judgments upon a nation which had so much and would do so little.",
        "A person can be lost in time..."

      "improvement_point": "Clarify the 'narrow way' as a specific calling from God that requires a decision, rather than an inevitable historical process."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the 'telos' of the conclusion, and the preacher affirms the two-natures doctrine implicitly. However, for much of the sermon, Christ is an example or a 'standard bearer' rather than the life-giving center.",
      "quotes": [
        "We bear the crown seal of Jesus Christ. We are sent by One who loved the world so intensely...",
        "He came here, being born in Bethlehem... rose from Joseph's tomb."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 1,950 words, the sermon likely clocks in just under the 20-minute threshold. While it has 'breadth' in terms of topics, it lacks the 'depth' of scriptural penetration Dekker demands.",
      "improvement_point": "Trade the administrative and historical preamble for deeper exegetical work to reach the required 20 minutes of substantive preaching."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "According to Dekker’s criteria, this text functions more as a 'keynote address' or 'state-of-the-convention speech' than a sermon. It fails the formal definition of being an 'exposition and application of a specific Bible passage.' The first 70% of the text is occupied with political, historical, and administrative matters. While the application to the zeitgeist is sharp and concrete, it is not rooted in the unique voice of a specific Scripture.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application: The preacher avoids 'general truths' by addressing specific political and social realities (Vietnam, Resurrection City).",
      "Trinitarian background: The sermon moves toward a Christological and doxological conclusion, acknowledging the 'One Lord'."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of scriptural specificity: The sermon treats the Bible as a source of 'keywords' (power) rather than a sovereign text to be expounded.",
      "Institutional burden: The inclusion of administrative reports and greetings 'burdens' the sermon with substantive weight that Dekker argues should 'sleep' during the proclamation."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's theses. It is a powerful rhetorical speech with biblical illustrations. It lacks the 'recreation of the Bible into a new, current, proclamatory word' because it starts with the world and looks for a biblical echo, rather than starting with the text and finding the world within it."
