One feels here in Washington that he stands close to the nerve center of the political arrangements of the whole earth. [...] And now as I prepare to pass the standard of leadership on to other and more capable hands and turn to take my place loyally again in the ranks among Progressive Baptists, 'To Jesus Christ be glory and honor and thanksgiving and power and might for ever and ever'."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The text fails Dekker's primary requirement of being an exposition of a 'specific Bible passage'. It functions more as a keynote address or a 'speech about the gospel' and 'refugees/social issues' which Dekker explicitly disqualifies. Multiple texts are used as proof-texts for a thematic development of 'power' rather than allowing one pericope to dictate the sermon's unique content.",
      "quotes": [
        "I find it illuminating that Jesus called his disciples apart, as it is recorded in the ninth chapter of Luke.",
        "That theme of power recurs like a symphonic theme through Holy Writ. I count 155 times it is used."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one specific pericope (e.g., Luke 9:1-6) and derive the entire movement of the sermon from its unique internal logic rather than using it to support a pre-existing social-political theme."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "There is no formal exposition of the original context or the meaning for the first readers. The Hebrew and Greek backgrounds are absent. The biblical references are used as rhetorical flourishes to support the speaker's observations on the zeitgeist.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Scriptures suggest that the apartness into which Jesus led his disciples was redemptive...",
        "The stranger who certified Jacob's new relationship spoke of power..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must explain what 'power and authority' meant in the Lucan context before jumping to the 'Black Power' movement."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is the strongest element. The application is highly concrete, addressing the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, and the specific internal politics of the Baptist convention. It avoids 'general truths' by naming specific figures and locations.",
      "quotes": [
        "America, what madness is upon you, that hearing the anguished cries of hunger from your own children you could be so unmoved...",
        "At Colgate Rochester Divinity School, I was steered to a separate section of the cafeteria..."

      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application flows from the text's specific demands rather than the speaker's political observations."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward application (social/political commentary) for the first two-thirds. The biblical 'exposition' is a late addition used to justify the previous points. There is no 'mixing' where the hearer is 'expounded' through the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have recently attended the Baptist World Alliance...",
        "I find it illuminating that Jesus called his disciples apart..."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'misery' is vividly present as social and racial suffering. 'Redemption' is present but leans toward social empowerment. 'Gratitude' is seen in the call to service. However, the 'misery' is more sociological than theological (misery before God).",
      "quotes": [
        "...the pained pleading of democracy's forgotten people.",
        "He came here... died on Calvary's cross, and rose from Joseph's tomb."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the definition of misery to include the 'coram Deo' aspect—man's lostness before God, not just his social deprivation."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon addresses the 'judgment of history' and the 'shame' of the nation, which aligns with Dekker's 'temporal loss'. However, it lacks the individual call to decision regarding eternal life/death that Dekker emphasizes as the complement to collective loss.",
      "quotes": [
        "...or else the God of history will act with summary judgments upon a nation...",
        "America, what madness is upon you..."
      ],

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the 'telos' at the end, and the doctrine of the two natures is implied in the closing litany. However, for much of the sermon, the 'telos' is social justice or organizational unity rather than the person of Christ.",
      "quotes": [
        "We bear the crown seal of Jesus Christ.",
        "We are sent by a God who came where we are in Jesus of Nazareth..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make Christ the 'telos' from the start, ensuring that grace is the 'deepest of life' rather than human 'power' (even if God-given)."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At approximately 1,950 words, the sermon meets the 20-minute requirement. It has the 'breadth' Miskotte requires, though much of that breadth is occupied by administrative and political reporting rather than theological depth.",
      "quotes": [
        "I shall not dwell upon our desire to secure property...",
        "I rejoice that our Christian Education Congress goes forward..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Replace the administrative reports and convention greetings with deeper theological reflection on the text."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "According to Dekker's criteria, this text functions more as a presidential address or a political-theological speech than a sermon. It lacks a specific pericope as its foundation, instead weaving various verses into a thematic discourse on 'Black Power' and social justice. While its application is concrete and its duration adequate, it fails the formal requirement of being an 'exposition' of the Word.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application: The sermon avoids vague moralisms and speaks directly to the zeitgeist (Vietnam, Civil Rights).",
      "Human subject: It takes the 'misery' of the human condition (specifically the black experience) seriously as a subject of the pulpit."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specific pericope: By treating the Bible as a source of keywords (power) rather than a specific voice, it misses the 'nowhere else' quality Dekker demands.",
      "Administrative clutter: Large sections are devoted to convention business, which 'burdens' the sermon with non-proclamatory weight.",
      "Weak exegesis: The original biblical context is entirely bypassed in favor of immediate contemporary correlation."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the strict sense of Dekker's definition. It is a powerful rhetorical speech that uses biblical motifs, but it does not 'recreate the Bible into a new, current, proclamatory word' because it does not submit itself to the constraints of a specific text."
