    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Parental' homiletics. It effectively diagnoses real social and psychological ills (Adult/Parent) but uses them to create a 'deficiency' in the listener that only the preacher's 'sufficiency' can fill. While it contains beautiful imagery and authentic Free Child moments, the underlying structure relies on inducing shame (Adapted Child) to motivate action (evangelism). The psychological impact is a cycle of relief followed by a new 'imperative' burden.",

      "Over-reliance on the 'Critical Parent' to define identity through duty.",
      "Pathologizing the human condition ('sickness', 'illness') to create a 'need' for the message."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try moving from 'Necessity is laid upon me' (Parent) to 'I choose to share because of the joy I process' (Adult/Free Child). Reduce the use of 'must' and 'should' to allow the listener to respond from a place of autonomy rather than compliance."
