    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of 'Prophetic' preaching that borders on psychological manipulation. While its social concerns are valid, it operates primarily through a Critical Parent ego state. It utilizes 'Ain't It Awful' to create a bond of shared indignation and 'Bait & Switch' to turn a mystical text into a political indictment. The listener is rarely addressed as an autonomous Adult capable of independent reflection; instead, they are pressured into a binary choice between 'Light' (the preacher's view) and 'Darkness' (the system).",

      "Over-reliance on the Critical Parent.",
      "Lack of Free Child spontaneity/joy.",
      "Reduction of complex theological symbols to singular political meanings."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation more as 'Adults' by asking open-ended questions about how they navigate these tensions, rather than providing the 'only' correct perception. Reduce the use of 'must' and 'we know exactly' to allow for authentic, non-coerced response."
