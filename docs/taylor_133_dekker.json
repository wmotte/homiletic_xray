Behind this passage there is the story of a man's journey through the years, his high confidence in himself, his shrewd dealings with family and friends. Behind this passage rests the experience of a man [...] I've wandered far away from God, Now I'm coming home. The paths of sin too long I've trod, Lord, I'm coming home. Open wide thine arms of love, Lord, I'm coming home. Coming home, coming home, never more to roam."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Genesis 35 as a springboard, but it functions more as a biographical survey of Jacob's life (Genesis 27-35) rather than an exposition of the specific text. It treats the passage as a 'biblical character study' or a 'biblical idea' (returning to God), which Dekker explicitly rejects as not being a sermon.",
      "quotes": [
        "Behind this passage there is the story of a man's journey through the years",
        "Jacob, you see, was a rascal, a smooth-talking, quick-thinking slicker."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus exclusively on the unique command in Genesis 35:1. What is in this specific command to 'dwell' at Bethel that is not in the previous encounter in Genesis 28?"
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of linguistic study (Hebrew) or historical-theological context of Israel. The exegesis is purely narrative and psychological. The preacher interprets the 'foreign gods' in verse 2 metaphorically without exploring the actual religious-historical context of Jacob's household.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jacob was a real smart, smooth, slick operator.",
        "His mother taught him to cheat in order to get ahead."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the theological significance of the 'altar' and the 'foreign gods' within the context of the patriarchal covenant and the history of Israel."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the 'zeitgeist' of New York and urban life, but it tends toward general moralizing and 'foxhole religion' psychology. It lacks the 'broad knowledge of the humanities' Dekker requires, leaning instead on sentimentalism.",
      "quotes": [
        "Goodbye, God, I am a New Yorker now!",
        "We know the daily doubles and the numbers and we read the ads."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the psychological 'need' for a sanctuary and address the concrete ethical and political implications of 'putting away strange gods' in a modern context."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon successfully avoids a strict 'block' structure. It moves back and forth between Jacob's story and the hearer's life. However, because the exposition is weak, the hearer is drawn into a psychological mirror rather than the text itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "What a striking similarity this man has to so many who listen to me now.",
        "The emergency passed, as it did with Jacob."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure that the 'application' arises from the specificities of the text's grammar and structure, not just from the general plot of the story."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon heavily emphasizes 'misery' (Jacob's failures/restlessness) and 'redemption' (returning to Bethel). However, it risks being too 'human-oriented.' The misery is presented as a lack of success or peace rather than misery 'before God.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Things were never going to work out for him; he was never going to have peace",
        "He needed God if he was going to make life's journey a victory march."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the concept of misery. It is not just that life 'doesn't work out,' but that man is lost without God's initiative."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon hints at the 'two ways' through the contrast of the 'shrewd operator' vs. the 'man of Bethel.' However, the 'seriousness of being lost' is framed mostly as temporal failure or lack of 'victory,' rather than the ultimate possibility of destruction.",
      "quotes": [
        "The world leads us that way. It keeps promising, just over the next hill is the prize.",
        "Every person needs a hiding place where the hounds of hell cannot track him."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'ultimate possibilities of life design' more sharply. What does it mean to be 'lost in time' if one refuses to go back to Bethel?"
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned only at the very end as a 'Savior' in a hymn quote. He is not the 'telos' of the sermon. The sermon is largely 'Theocentric' in a general sense, or even 'Jacob-centric,' rather than Christocentric.",
      "quotes": [
        "O bless me now, my Savior I come to thee."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Show how Christ is the true Bethel (the house of God) and how the 'return' is only possible through His mediation, not just a psychological decision to 'go back.'"
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "With an estimated duration of 14-15 minutes, the sermon fails Dekker's requirement that a sermon must last at least 20 minutes to achieve necessary depth. The brevity contributes to the lack of thorough exegesis.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section (Thesis 2) to provide the 'breadth' that 'depth' requires."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily because it functions as a psychological character study rather than a specific exposition of the Word. It lacks the required length (under 20 minutes) and fails to make Christ the theological telos. While it is concrete in its description of the human condition in a modern city, it relies too much on sentimentalism and general truths about 'needing God' rather than the specific revelation of the text.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete contemporary application regarding urban life and the 'zeitgeist' of self-reliance.",
      "Effective interwoveness of narrative and application, keeping the hearer engaged with the story."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length and depth; fails the 20-minute rule.",
      "Lack of specific exegesis; the preacher speaks about 'Jacob' in general rather than the specificities of Genesis 35.",
      "Absence of a robust Christological focus; Christ is an afterthought in a hymn rather than the goal of the proclamation."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an engaging religious speech, but according to Dekker's strict formal definition, it is not a sermon. It lacks the breadth of exposition and the specific focus on what 'this text' says that can be found 'nowhere else.'"
