    "logos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The rational architecture is built on a clear, albeit singular, analogy: the NFL lineman. The preacher moves from a cultural observation (sports glory) to a theological redefinition (divine glory). The logical thread is traceable: traditional glory is self-assertive, but biblical glory (Exodus and John) is relational. The use of source criticism (P vs J) provides a scholarly backbone to the argument, distinguishing between a God who 'gets glory' over Pharaoh and a God who responds to the 'precious relatedness' of the people. However, the transition between the Exodus narrative and the John 1 prologue is somewhat abrupt, relying more on thematic overlap than rigorous exegetical connection. The conclusion follows the premise that if God's glory is relational, human glory (as those made in God's image) must also be relational.",

        "The Exodus story, however, sharply deviates from this glory script.",

      "specific_diagnosis": "The sermon is logically coherent but relies heavily on a single metaphor to carry the weight of the argument."

    "pathos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating 'slices of life' that evoke immediate recognition and emotional resonance. By juxtaposing the 'crunching quarterback sack' with the image of a father taking a three-year-old to the bathroom, the preacher grounds high theology in mundane, tender human experiences. This creates a bridge to the heart by appealing to the listener's own values of family and care over public recognition. The language is sensory ('smell of the pigsty' is absent, but 'debris' and 'frightened peasants' are present). The emotional tone shifts effectively from the high-energy 'Hallelujah' of the winner to the 'hurt-shaped' vulnerability of the cross.",
      "quotes": [
        "He must take his beloved three-year-old to the bathroom. He must do it now and must miss out on the crowd and the glory.",
        "He says, 'No, not really. You see, I adore my little daughter...'",
        "This glory comes cross-shaped, hurt-shaped, driven by vulnerability."

        "Vivid, recognizable imagery that humanizes the divine.",

    "ethos": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher speaks with the authority of a teacher/scholar (referencing Harold Bloom and P/J sources), which establishes intellectual credibility. However, there is a lack of personal vulnerability. The preacher observes the lineman and the text but does not explicitly place themselves within the struggle for 'new glory.' The 'we' is used collectively ('we have indeed beheld'), but the preacher remains a somewhat distant narrator of the analogy. The ethos is that of a 'witness to a truth' rather than a 'fellow struggler.' The authority is derived from the text and the cleverness of the analogy rather than personal testimony or shared weakness.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is remarkable that a good source analysis of Exodus 14 distinguishes between P and J.",

    "balance_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward Pathos through its creative and evocative metaphors. The Logos is sufficient to support the Pathos, providing a framework for the 'lineman' analogy to function. However, the Ethos is the weakest link; the preacher is a master of the metaphor but remains behind the curtain. The balance is effective for a teaching moment but lacks the 'weight' of a witness who has lived the transition from 'sacking Pharaoh' to 'taking the child to the bathroom'.",

    "overall_rhetorical_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of narrative-analogical preaching. It takes a complex theological concept—the glory of God (Kabod/Doxa)—and makes it accessible through a pervasive cultural metaphor. The strength lies in its ability to subvert expectations: taking the 'macho' world of the NFL and using it to illustrate the 'vulnerable' glory of God. The logic is consistent, and the emotional resonance is high due to the concrete, domestic nature of the illustrations. However, the sermon stops short of excellence because the preacher remains a narrator rather than a participant. The 'Ethos' is professional but not personal. While the 'Logos' is clear, it relies perhaps too much on the analogy, which occasionally risks trivializing the Exodus event. Overall, it is an effective, memorable, and intellectually stimulating sermon that successfully challenges the hearer's worldview.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Creative and consistent use of the NFL lineman metaphor.",
      "Sophisticated integration of source criticism (P and J) into a popular format.",
      "Powerful redefinition of 'glory' through the lens of the Cross."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase personal vulnerability to strengthen Ethos.",
      "Diversify imagery beyond the sports metaphor to reach a wider audience.",
      "Deepen the exegetical connection between the Exodus 14 and John 1 texts."
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Metaphorical-Subversive",
    "audience_analysis": "Appeals most to those who appreciate contemporary analogies and a 'God of the underdog' theology, though it may slightly alienate those who find sports metaphors distracting.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Try to find the 'glory' in a non-sports context to see if the logic holds.",
      "Use 'I' more than 'we' when discussing the struggle for humility.",
      "Spend more time on the 'grace and truth' (hesed and emeth) word study."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a rhetorically effective piece that uses Pathos to drive home a theological shift in the understanding of God. While it scores well on Logos and Pathos, the lack of personal Ethos prevents it from being a truly transformative 'witness' sermon. It remains a very high-quality 'teaching' sermon."
