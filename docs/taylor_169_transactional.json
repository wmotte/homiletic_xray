    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. The preacher avoids the common trap of the 'Critical Parent' who uses the pulpit to enforce compliance. Instead, he uses his 'Adult' to dismantle the ego's need for control, eventually inviting the 'Free Child' of the listener into a state of wonder. By admitting his own limitations and refusing to play the 'Rescuer,' he empowers the listener's own spiritual autonomy.",

      "The 'frustrated preacher' trope could occasionally lean toward a subtle Victim role if overused.",
      "The dismissal of 'reason' could be misinterpreted as anti-intellectualism if not balanced by the Adult's careful analysis."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to explicitly disclaim the 'Rescuer' role. By saying 'I cannot make it clear,' you prevent the listener from becoming a dependent 'Victim' of your expertise."
