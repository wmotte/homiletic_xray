  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust because it avoids the standard 'Rescuer' trap of providing cheap comfort. By utilizing a strong Adult ego position to analyze the 'terror' in Mark's Gospel, the preacher respects the listener's intelligence. While there is a trace of the 'Critical Parent' in the critique of greeting cards, it serves a clear theological purpose: moving the listener from a passive 'Adapted Child' (enjoying bunnies) to an 'Adult' who faces the reality of death and the shock of resurrection. The sermon promotes autonomy by grounding faith in 'trusting witnesses' rather than emotional manipulation.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement with biblical difficulty.",
      "Refusal to use 'smothering' Nurturing Parent language to mask the reality of death.",
      "High transparency regarding the nature of faith vs. certainty."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Ain't It Awful' dynamic regarding church bookstores can create a 'we-them' clique mentality.",
      "The Critical Parent tone regarding 'generic Easter' may alienate the very visitors she claims to welcome."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To remain entirely game-free, try to express the 'Real Easter' without needing the 'Generic Easter' as a foil. This reduces the 'Ain't It Awful' transaction and keeps the focus on the transformative power of the Adult-to-Adult witness."
