The passage from Matthew is always read on this day. Only Matthew tells of the Magi; the shepherds and the angel are only in Luke. [...] This infant will become a man who will be “spoken against” not only by Jewish and Gentile rulers alike, but even by his own disciples. He will give himself up for torture and a miserable death on a cross, abandoned by those he came to deliver. This is the preordained climax toward which all the various epiphanies move."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The text fails Dekker's first requirement of specificity. Instead of a single pericope, it is a thematic lecture covering Matthew 2, Luke 2, Ephesians 2, Isaiah 40, Isaiah 60, and Revelation 21. It treats 'The Epiphany' as a concept rather than recreating a specific Word of God from one text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Matthew and Luke are telling us quite different (though complementary) things",
        "Thus we read the indispensable passage from Ephesians",

      "score_1_to_10": 6,

      "findings": "Application is almost entirely absent. The text remains a historical and theological lecture.

      "findings": "At approximately 18.5 minutes, the sermon falls just short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. While it has 'breadth' in terms of biblical references, it lacks 'depth' because it stays on the surface of historical explanation rather than deep existential application.",

  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text fails the formal definition of a sermon according to Dekker. It is a theological essay or a 'speech about the gospel' rather than an exposition and application of a specific passage. It lacks contemporary application, fails to address the hearer as a subject, and ignores the 'two ways' of human responsibility. While Christologically sound, it remains too objective and academic.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christological focus (Thesis 7), correctly identifying Christ as the telos of the narrative.",
      "Adequate use of original context and academic rigor (Thesis 2) regarding the Magi and Herod."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specificity (Thesis 1); the sermon is a thematic 'mash-up' of multiple Bible books.",
      "Complete absence of concrete, contemporary application (Thesis 3).",
      "The hearer is never brought to the point of decision or personal 'misery' (Theses 5 & 6)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon; it is a lecture. It lacks the 'current, proclamatory word' that recreates the Bible for the 'now'. It informs the mind but does not 'expound' the hearer."
