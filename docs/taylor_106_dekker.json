Many that day, we can safely believe, saw and believed; and, while they were afraid to speak, their hearts were turned toward God's throne. [...] There is a God who rules above, With hand of power and heart of love. If I am right, he'll fight my battle. I shall have peace some day."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon lacks a singular scriptural foundation. It functions as a thematic address on the Montgomery Bus Boycott using biblical motifs rather than an exposition of a specific pericope. It jumps from the Passion narrative to Philippians without recreating a specific text into a 'new, current word'.",
      "quotes": [
        "\"He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ\" (Philippians 1:6).",
        "if we are \"planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection.\""
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one specific pericope (e.g., the centurion at the cross) and extract what is unique to that text rather than using it as a springboard for general civil rights encouragement."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of linguistic study or historical-critical engagement with the original context of the cited verses. The 'meaning for the first readers' is entirely bypassed in favor of immediate metaphorical application.",
      "quotes": [
        "The central drama of the Christian faith is the death of our Lord..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must explain the specific theological weight of 'koinonia' or 'epiteleo' in the Philippians text before applying it to the Montgomery context."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is the sermon's strongest point. The application is highly concrete, addressing the specific situation in Montgomery. It avoids 'general truths' by naming the specific struggle, though it risks becoming a political speech rather than a sermon.",
      "quotes": [
        "Here in Montgomery, behind shutters and in rooms of which you know not...",
        "By your Calvary, Montgomery has become a central item on the prayer agenda of the world."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application remains an application *of the text* rather than the text being an illustration of the social situation."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Because there is little to no exposition, there is no 'interweaving'. The text is used as a decorative layer over a contemporary analysis. The hearer is not drawn into the text, but the text is pulled into the hearer's political reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "Even while you wait for the resurrection faith to be reasserted, things are happening."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Allow the biblical text to 'expound' the hearer by letting the specific logic of the scripture dictate the structure of the contemporary analysis."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The categories of misery (the struggle/crucifixion) and redemption (the resurrection/victory) are present. However, misery is framed more as social oppression than 'misery before God'. Redemption is framed as social vindication.",
      "quotes": [
        "Galling may be our cross, steep may be our way...",
        "The coming forth of the reigning Lord represents for Christians the denial of all the charges of injustice..."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon hints at the two ways through the contrast of 'Satan's cause' and 'God's way'. It emphasizes the collective 'being lost in time' (society perishing), but lacks the individual call to decision regarding eternal loss.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wickedness a while may reign, Satan's cause may seem to gain.",
        "God will not leave our souls in hell."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, and the resurrection is central. However, Christ is often used as a prototype for the movement's suffering rather than the unique Savior who detaches man from himself.",
      "quotes": [
        "Christ leads captivity captive and puts to rout the armies of the aliens.",
        "The resurrection of the Lord Christ was the reversal of all the world's verdicts..."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "At approximately 7 minutes, the sermon fails Dekker's requirement for 'breadth'. It lacks the space to develop the 'depth' required for a substantive exposition and application.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the sermon to at least 20 minutes by incorporating rigorous exegesis and a broader humanities-based analysis of the zeitgeist."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text falls short of being a 'sermon' in the Dekkerian sense. It lacks a specific scriptural pericope, bypasses exegesis entirely, and is significantly too short to achieve theological depth. While it excels in concrete application to the Montgomery context, it functions more as a motivational speech with biblical coloring than a 'recreation of the Bible into a new, proclamatory word'.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application: It avoids the 'vague generalities' Dekker forbids.",
      "Psychological relevance: It addresses the 'soul searching' and 'heavy hearts' of the congregation directly.",
      "Trinitarian background: It links the struggle to God's providence and the Spirit's work in commitment."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specific pericope: It treats the Bible as a source of keywords and ideas rather than a specific text to be expounded.",
      "Absence of exegesis: No engagement with original languages or historical context.",
      "Insufficient length: At under 7 minutes, it cannot provide the necessary 'breadth' for 'depth'."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon according to the formal definition. It is an occasional address. It fails the primary test of being an 'exposition' of a 'specific Bible passage' and lacks the required duration for substantive ministry."
