      "presence": "Medium",
      "analysis": "The preacher addresses the 'thinking subject' during the exegesis of Gideon and Isaiah, but shifts to a Parent role when diagnosing the congregation's spiritual health.",

    "analysis": "The preacher speaks as a wise, authoritative Parent to a 'sinful, helpless' Child. The transaction is stable because the preacher includes themselves in the 'sinful' category, making the Parent role feel less like an attack and more like a shared burden.",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Grace-based' preaching that paradoxically relies on high-intensity 'Parent' ego states. While it aims to comfort, it does so by first inducing a state of 'holy dread' and defining the listener as morally deficient. This creates a dependency loop where the listener must feel 'bad' to feel 'saved.' The use of the Drama Triangle (God/Preacher as Rescuer, Listener as Victim) undermines the 'Adult' autonomy of the believer.",

      "Strong use of Adult ego state for historical and textual context.",

      "High reliance on 'terror' as a pedagogical tool.",
      "Over-identification of the listener with 'Victim' roles (addict, nonentity)."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation's Adult ego state more consistently. Instead of telling them they are 'puffed up' (CP), ask them to reflect on their own experiences of privilege (A). Move from 'Rescuing' the listener to 'Empowering' the Free Child to respond to grace with agency rather than just passive 'dread'."
