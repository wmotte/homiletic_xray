    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative games. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, using sociological analysis to engage the listener's intellect, while the Nurturing Parent provides a framework for dignity. By using 'we' instead of 'you,' the preacher avoids the Critical Parent trap of moral superiority. The sermon seeks to move the listener from an Adapted Child state (defined by skin color or possessions) to a Free Child state (defined by radiant faith and inherent worth).",

      "High Adult presence through intellectual engagement.",

      "The 'Ain't It Awful' framing of 'modernity' could be interpreted as a slight move toward a Victim stance regarding the outside world.",
      "The 'prodigal' imagery risks a brief dip into Parent-Child dependency if not balanced by the call to action."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use inclusive pronouns ('we') and maintain the balance between diagnostic Adult analysis and the Nurturing Parent's call to inherent dignity."
