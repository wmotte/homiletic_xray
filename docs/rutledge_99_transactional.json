    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and exceptionally transparent. It operates almost entirely from the Adult ego state, engaging the listener's intellect and curiosity. By avoiding the 'Critical Parent' voice, it bypasses the common trap of inducing guilt. Instead, it uses the 'Nurturing Parent' and 'Free Child' archetypes to describe God's generosity, creating a sense of safety and abundance. The lack of psychological 'Games' makes it a rare example of non-coercive religious communication.",
    "strengths": [

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Could integrate more 'Free Child' spontaneity to balance the heavy academic/Adult tone.",
      "Slightly dismissive of 'sentimental' interpretations which might alienate some listeners."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to provide objective data and theological context as you have done. To ensure the 'Adult' doesn't become 'Dry,' occasionally invite the listener's 'Free Child' to imagine the sensory details of the feast more vividly, ensuring this remains an invitation rather than a command."
