There have been changes in the lectionary in recent decades, not welcomed everywhere, particularly since there has long been a Feast of the Transfiguration already appointed [...] With shining face and bright array, Christ deigns to manifest today What glory shall be theirs above who joy in God with perfect love."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The text fails Dekker's primary requirement of a single pericope. It is a thematic essay on 'glory' (doxa) and 'transfiguration' across multiple biblical books. It lacks the specificity of what THIS text says that can be found nowhere else.",
      "quotes": [
        "The transfiguration scene is given great emphasis in all three Synoptics and appears in a Johannine form...",
        "A brief reflection on the relationship of the transfiguration and the Sermon on the Mount to the Christology of the Gospel of Matthew is in order."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one specific account (e.g., Mark 9) and isolate its unique literary and theological features rather than harmonizing multiple traditions."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates academic competence in biblical languages and historical-theological concepts (aseity, chabod). However, the exegesis serves a systematic-theological theme rather than uncovering the original context of a specific passage.",
      "quotes": [
        "This distinction is important, because it preserves God’s aseity (Latin aseitas, 'being from itself')",
        "the least distanced descriptions of the divine chabod in the Old Testament..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Anchor the linguistic insights into the specific narrative movement of one text instead of using them as building blocks for a general theology of light."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application remains largely meta-homiletical (talking about how to preach/read) or general. It lacks the concrete, 'true truth' regarding the hearer's specific world, politics, or personal psychology that Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "The reader should pray to be enabled to convey the sense of wonder and awe...",
        "Those who listen to sermons and teachings can demand more than they are getting."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Exposition and application are somewhat mixed, but because the 'application' is often about the act of reading Scripture itself, the hearer is not truly 'expounded' alongside the text. It feels more like a lecture on biblical theology.",
      "quotes": [
        "Conscientious readers of Scripture will submit themselves to the passage as its servants...",
        "When the person preaching on that day is similarly struck... there will be transfiguration of Christian believers."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Redemption (glory) is heavily present. Misery is mentioned briefly ('sinful and limited condition'), but it is not the background of the sermon. The psychological depth Dekker seeks is absent; man is not sufficiently the subject.",
      "quotes": [
        "Human beings in our present sinful and limited condition are not able to see God directly.",
        "The transfiguration of human nature... is not achieved by human means. It is the gift of God."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon mentions 'judgment' and 'darkness' in the context of John 12, but it fails to bring the hearer to a point of personal or collective decision. There is no sense of the 'possibility of being lost'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Walk while you have the light, lest the darkness overtake you...",
        "Now is the judgment of this world..."

      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "This is the strongest point. Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon maintains a high Christology (two natures) and emphasizes that salvation is outside of man.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus is the light of the world.",
        "Everything depends on who Jesus is. The person who is speaking in the sermon is the one who is able to give power..."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 16 minutes (1650 words), the sermon falls short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for true 'depth'.",

      "improvement_point": "Expand the specific exposition and concrete application to allow the text to breathe beyond 20 minutes."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text functions more as a theological treatise or a 'sermon on preaching' than a sermon itself. It fails the primary formal requirement of being an exposition of one specific passage, instead drifting into a thematic survey. While Christologically robust, it lacks concrete contemporary application and the 'three parts' (misery, redemption, gratitude) are imbalanced, with misery being largely theoretical.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christological focus and commitment to the 'One Lord'.",
      "Theologically substantive use of dogmatic categories like aseity and the two natures.",
      "Clear rejection of moralistic 'get down from the mountain' preaching."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of a specific pericope; too many texts dilute the 'nowhere else' factor.",
      "Insufficient length (under 20 minutes) prevents necessary depth.",
      "Application is too focused on how to handle the Bible rather than how the Bible handles the hearer's life."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "According to Dekker's criteria, this is not yet a sermon. It is a high-quality theological lecture. To become a sermon, it must commit to one text, extend its duration, and move from general theological truths to concrete, specific application for the contemporary hearer."
