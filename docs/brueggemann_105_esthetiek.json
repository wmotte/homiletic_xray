    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily derived from the biblical parables themselves rather than original poetic invention. The preacher effectively 'paints' the scene of the midnight knocker and the parental gift-giving (fish/snake, egg/scorpion). There is a strong sensory moment in the description of the 'snoozing' God and the 'pounding' on the door. However, the imagery remains largely functional and illustrative rather than evocative or atmospheric. It follows Paul Scott Wilson's 'show, don't tell' rule intermittently; it shows the biblical scene but 'tells' the theological meaning quite rapidly. The modern image of the eight-year-old girl in the State House provides a sharp, concrete visual that grounds the abstract concept of 'impudence' in a contemporary political reality, which is the sermon's strongest imagistic move.",
      "quotes": [
        "God is the one who will, late in a night of urgency, be move to act. Prayer will disturb God’s snooze.",
        "No father will give a child who needs a fish a snake. No mother will give a child a scorpion who needs an egg.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise and avoids traditional 'Canaanite' jargon, opting instead for a more intellectual, slightly academic vocabulary ('imperatives', 'litigant', 'extrapolate', 'transaction'). This precision serves the 'stewardship of language' by clarifying what prayer actually is—a 'strange transaction.' The preacher is careful with word meanings, specifically the Greek 'persistence' as 'impudence.' There is a clear attempt to do justice to the nuance of the human-divine relationship without falling into platitudes. The use of 'failed father' and 'mother God' shows a careful, inclusive, and realistic approach to human experience. However, the phrasing occasionally feels slightly clinical ('defining engagement', 'rational world that prizes control'), which may distance the hearer from the raw emotion of the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "It can be translated 'impudent' or 'shameless.' Knock on the door of a friend at midnight impudently.",
        "We cannot, on our own, avoid trial before the authorities, but count on God as our litigant.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a clear, rhythmic cadence, particularly in the use of parallelisms and repetitions. The section on 'We cannot... but...' creates a liturgical staccato that builds momentum. The preacher uses the 'Ask/Seek/Knock' triad to create a natural flow. However, the overall structure feels somewhat like a lecture, with numbered sections (I, II, III) that can make the rhythm feel 'bureaucratic' or 'paper-like' rather than a living oral event. The sentences are generally of medium length, lacking the dramatic 'legato' needed for deeper reflection. It is a 'clean' text, but it lacks the poetic 'shiver' or the rhythmic 'groove' that characterizes high-level homiletic musicality. It is effective for teaching but less so for liturgical 'happening'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ask and it will be given, but only if we ask; Knock and it will be opened, but only if we knock; Seek and you will find, but only if we seek.",

    "average_score_language": 6.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is intellectually robust and precise, successfully avoiding religious kitsch through a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic. It excels in linguistic stewardship by redefining 'persistence' as 'impudence,' thereby 'reframing' prayer as an assertive act. While the imagery is grounded in the biblical text and a strong contemporary anecdote, it lacks a certain poetic depth or sensory richness. The rhythm is functional and clear, utilizing parallelism effectively, though it occasionally feels more like an academic lecture than a performative event. It is a text that respects the hearer's intelligence but could benefit from more 'showing' and less 'explaining'."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Lowry-esque' plot movement. It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' by highlighting the 'imperative' nature of the Lord's Prayer—challenging the 'polite' view of prayer. It moves into the 'complication' of the sleeping friend (God's apparent indifference) and reaches a 'climax' with the Nashville story and the 'How much more' promise. The 'turning point' is the realization that prayer 'disturbs God's snooze.' The energy is sustained well, moving from the text to a social example and finally to a theological re-characterization of God. It is not a static three-point sermon but a journey toward 'shamelessness.' However, the resolution feels a bit quick; the 'Holy Spirit' as the final gift is mentioned but not fully 'performed' in the text's ending.",
      "quotes": [
        "Did you also notice, as I did this time, that the prayer... voices to God a series of imperatives.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest aesthetic feature. The 'reframing' (Cilliers) is masterful. The preacher takes the 'strangeness' of the Lukan text—a God who sleeps and must be nagged—and integrates it with a critique of modern 'self-sufficiency' and 'helicopter parenting.' The Nashville anecdote is not just an 'illustration' but a 'reframing' of the biblical 'persistence' into a contemporary political and moral act. It honors the 'then' of the rabbi and the 'now' of the State House. The synthesis is organic; the preacher uses the text to look at our 'rational world' and finds it lacking. It creates a 'space' where the biblical world and the modern world collide to produce a new perspective on 'holiness' and 'mastery.'",
      "quotes": [
        "To be a creature of need is a countercultural claim in a society that imagines self-sufficiency.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is an 'open work of art' in its refusal to offer 'cheap comfort' or 'kitsch' solutions. It leaves the hearer with the 'sobering' reality of a God who is not a 'helicopter parent.' However, the structure is somewhat 'closed' by its strong argumentative logic. The preacher 'tells' the hearer what the text 'exposits' and 're-characterizes.' While it raises deep questions about our 'mastery' and 'control,' it provides a fairly definitive theological answer. The ending is an 'invitation' to be like Aamira, which is more of a 'moral imperative' than an 'open ending.' It respects the hearer as a 'mature conversation partner' (Stark) but doesn't leave much room for the 'ambivalence' of unanswered prayer, which is the shadow side of this text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Such a transaction is more than a little sobering for us in a rational world that prizes control.",
        "Jesus summons us to be like eight-year-old Aamira, shameless and impudent.",
        "This is a God who has a life to live, who sleeps in weariness, who does not want to be interrupted."

    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is strong, characterized by a dynamic narrative arc that successfully 'reframes' the biblical text for a contemporary audience. The sermon avoids the 'static three-point' trap, moving instead through a series of 'illuminations' that culminate in a sharp social example. The integration of text and context is the highlight, creating a 'space for grace' that is both countercultural and intellectually honest. While the structure is logically tight, it could benefit from more 'openness'—allowing the tensions of the 'midnight' to linger longer before moving to the theological resolution."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a masterclass in anti-kitsch. It explicitly rejects the 'helicopter parent' God and the 'reasonable' God of progressives—both forms of religious kitsch. It refuses 'pre-chewed emotions' or 'cheap comfort.' By characterizing God as 'weary' and 'sleeping,' and prayer as 'impudent' and 'disturbing,' it avoids the 'sentimental' trap of much contemporary preaching on prayer. The Nashville example is gritty and political, not 'sweet' or 'pious.' The 'Holy Spirit' is presented as a 'force of life' for 'daring testimony,' not as a 'warm fuzzy feeling.' It sustains the 'pain of suffering' by acknowledging our 'creatures of need' status without offering a 'happy ending' where every prayer is answered as requested.",

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens 'space for grace' by first clearing away the 'clutter' of self-sufficiency and moralism. By framing prayer as 'asking for what we cannot do for ourselves,' it creates a vacuum that only grace can fill. Cilliers' concept of 'reframing' is evident: the hearer is invited to see their 'need' not as a weakness to be fixed by 'exercise programs' but as the 'space' where God's 'generosity' happens. However, the 'space' is slightly narrowed by the 'summons' at the end; the 'imperative' to be impudent can feel like a new 'work' or 'task' rather than a 'gift.' The 'mystery' of God's 'snooze' is respected, but the 'Holy Spirit' resolution is a bit 'dogmatically sealed.'",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between 'God's weariness' and 'human urgency' are well-sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'strangeness' of the divine-human transaction is kept central.",

    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high-quality 'Sober-Reformed' aesthetic that prioritizes intellectual precision and the 'reframing' of reality over sensory decoration or emotional manipulation. Its aesthetic power lies in its 'honesty' and its ability to 'disturb' the hearer's settled frames of reference regarding both God and prayer. It successfully avoids the 'kitsch' of sentimental piety, offering instead a 'sobering' and 'countercultural' vision of human dependence and divine generosity. The use of a contemporary political anecdote (Aamira Fetuga) provides a vital aesthetic anchor that prevents the sermon from becoming a dry academic exercise. While the language is more 'precise' than 'poetic,' and the structure more 'logical' than 'open,' the sermon creates a genuine 'space for grace' by honoring the 'strangeness' of the biblical text. It is a 'witness' (Long) to a God who is both unavailable (sleeping) and radically available (giving the Spirit).",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of prayer as 'impudence' rather than 'polite petition'.",
      "Total absence of religious kitsch and sentimental clichés.",

    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Anti-kitsch) and Thomas Long (Preacher as Witness).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'modern-rational' hearers who are skeptical of sentimentality but hungry for an intellectually honest and socially relevant faith.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'cinematic' descriptions of the biblical 'midnight' to engage the senses.",
      "Use more 'oral' rhetorical figures (alliteration, rhythmic variation) to enhance musicality.",
      "Practice 'staying in the tension' of the 'locked door' longer before providing the 'Holy Spirit' solution."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically 'strong' sermon (7.2) that excels in 'reframing' and 'authenticity.' It avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by embracing a 'sober beauty' and intellectual rigor. While it leans toward the 'academic' in its language care and 'logical' in its structure, its ability to bridge the biblical world and the contemporary State House makes it a compelling 'event' of truth. It successfully opens 'space for grace' by deconstructing human self-sufficiency, though it could further enhance its aesthetic impact by embracing more sensory imagery and a more 'open' dramaturgical conclusion."
