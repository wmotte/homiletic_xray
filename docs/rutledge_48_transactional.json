Instead, he maintains an authentic Adult stance by pointing to the 'extraordinary' behavior of Moses/Christ as a reality to be observed."

    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and game-free. It avoids the common homiletical trap of using the Critical Parent to shame the 'greedy' or the 'sinful.' Instead, it uses the Adult ego state to analyze the human condition and the Nurturing Parent to offer the 'shield' of divine mercy. By refusing to participate in the 'Drama Triangle' of the 2008 financial crisis (refusing to persecute the CEOs), the preacher invites the listener into a mature, self-reflective faith.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use humor and irony to deconstruct the Critical Parent. The 'side comment' technique (borrowed from Paul) is an excellent way to maintain an Adult-Adult transaction."
