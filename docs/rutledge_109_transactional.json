        "score": 8,
        "score_explanation": "High score due to the preacher's refusal to use the pulpit as a seat of judgment; she includes herself in the 'ungodly' category.",
        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher avoids 'must' and 'should' language, instead using 'maybe' and 'we' to invite change rather than demand it.",

          "I confess to you that I love first-class treatment myself.",

      "presence": "High",
      "analysis": "The preacher provides objective data about the Jerusalem Temple and psychological data about human behavior (naming 'dorks', the Olympic bias) to engage the listener's reasoning.",
      "quotes": [
        "In order to understand the significance of this, we need to know something about the Jerusalem temple.",

        "presence_of_adaptation": "Low",
        "analysis": "She rejects the 'Adapted Child' role of 'good religious people' who try to earn preference.",

    "analysis": "The preacher treats the congregation as peers. Even when addressing children, she does not 'talk down' but explains concepts clearly.",

    "communicative_purity_score": 9,
    "purity_explanation": "The sermon is remarkably transparent. There is no 'holier-than-thou' hidden message.",
    "risk_explanation": "The only risk is a slight 'Nurturing Parent' tone when she suggests 'the answer is to keep telling the story,' which could be seen as a soft directive."

    "preacher_roles": {
      "rescuer": "Low. She points to the 'Jesus story' rather than her own expertise.",

  },
  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and game-free. By using her own 'First Class' desires as a case study, the preacher levels the playing field, moving from a potential Parent-Child dynamic to an Adult-Adult dialogue. She identifies the psychological 'payoff' of exclusion (feeling better than others) and replaces it with the 'Free Child' joy of shared grace. The analysis of the Temple curtain serves as an intellectual (Adult) framework that supports the emotional (Child) relief of being 'accepted' despite being 'ungodly'.",
    "strengths": [
      "Radical vulnerability and self-disclosure.",
      "Deconstruction of social 'games' like name-calling and status-seeking.",
      "High level of Adult ego state engagement through historical context."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to 'the answer' (Hebrews 10) is slightly more 'Parental' than the rest of the sermon.",
      "Could further explore the 'Free Child's' joy in the 'ungodly' status."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'we' and 'us' to maintain the Adult-Adult transaction. The use of personal confession is the most effective tool here to prevent the 'Drama Triangle' from forming."
