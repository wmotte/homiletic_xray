    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Nurturing Parent' homiletics that relies on a 'Critical Parent' foundation. It uses high-quality prose and moving analogies to invite the listener into a state of 'Adapted Child' dependency. While theologically orthodox in many traditions, the psychological dynamic suggests that the listener's value is found only in their 'wretchedness,' which enhances the 'bounty' of the Rescuer (God/Preacher). This creates a cycle where the listener must feel bad to feel the 'payoff' of grace.",

      "Clear Adult-level historical and textual analysis.",
      "High emotional resonance."

      "Heavy reliance on shaming language ('no health in us').",
      "Creating a 'Victim' identity for the congregation to justify the 'Rescuer' message.",
      "Theological 'NIGYSOB'—insisting everyone is a 'miserable offender' regardless of their actual life context."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as 'Adults' who are capable of choosing the good, rather than 'Children' on the verge of self-destruction. Shift the focus from the 'merit' God gets from our misery to the 'partnership' God invites us into through the Trinity."
