  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Mark 10:46-52 as its base, but it treats the text as a generic 'drama' rather than a unique revelation. It fails to identify what is in this text that can be found nowhere else. Instead, it imports external metaphors (Grand Central Station) and general biblical themes (Psalm 34, Hebrews 7) that dilute the specificity of the pericope.",
      "quotes": [
        "As I thought about the text for today as a drama to be performed, I thought of the phrase “gigantic stage on which are played a thousand dramas daily.”"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the unique theological weight of Bartimaeus's specific cry 'Son of David' in the context of Mark's Messianic secret, rather than using it as a general idiom for 'good promises'."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The exegesis is superficial. While it mentions the 'Son of David' title, it does not delve into the Greek nuances or the specific historical-religious context of Jericho as the final stop before Jerusalem. The preacher uses 'imagination' to fill gaps rather than rigorous historical-critical exposition.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are left to imagine the dramatic performance of the three characters in the drama.",
        "Bartimaeus has been reading the Hebrew Scriptures (or having them read to him)..."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application is somewhat psychological and sociological (disability, economic disadvantage), but it remains largely metaphorical. The 'gigantic stage' is a cultural philosophy trope that lacks the concrete 'true truth' Dekker demands. It offers 'roles' to play rather than specific contemporary imperatives.",
      "quotes": [
        "We could play the role of the silencing crowd that does not want the work of Jesus interrupted by poverty or disability...",
        "The gawkers and the hawkers and the hackers want to draw us to their little stages..."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon avoids the 'block' structure of exposition then application. It attempts to draw the hearer into the 'drama' throughout. However, because the exposition is weak, the interwoven application feels more like a literary commentary than a proclamatory event.",
      "quotes": [
        "So consider the three characters. The character who draws our attention is Bartimaeus.",
        "The reason Bartimaeus must call out a second time more loudly is because he has been interrupted..."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The categories of misery (blindness/begging) and redemption (healing) are present. However, misery is treated more as a 'presenting problem' or a 'role' rather than the radical theological misery of man before God. Gratitude is framed as 'glad obedience' and 'discipleship'.",
      "quotes": [
        "He might well be without hope for any good thing happening in his life.",
        "He signed on with the Jesus movement because he knew that Jesus... would transform the world."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon mentions 'dropping out of the drama' and 'having no future there,' which hints at the two ways. However, it lacks the gravity of eternal or temporal 'loss' that Dekker emphasizes. The choice is presented more as an invitation to 'experiment' with roles rather than a life-and-death decision.",

        "They are displaced in the story... having no future there.",

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the 'telos' and the 'healer.' The sermon affirms his power to transform. However, the focus often shifts to the 'roles' we play, which risks becoming anthropocentric. Grace is present but is described as 'transformative action' rather than the radical 'salvation outside oneself'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus, Son of David, carrier of God’s mercy, would transform the world.",
        "He is the big reliable connector between the plight of the world and the mercy of the God of heaven."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 1850 words, the sermon likely lasts 18-19 minutes. According to Dekker's Thesis 8, it falls just short of the 20-minute minimum required for 'depth.' The breadth is achieved through external biblical cross-references rather than deep drilling into the specific pericope.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical depth of the specific Markan text to reach the 20-minute threshold, allowing the text itself to provide the 'breadth'."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily due to its reliance on a central metaphor ('the gigantic stage') that originates outside the text, leading to a 'general truth' rather than a specific word from the pericope. It lacks the rigorous exegesis (Hebrew/Greek context) and the sharp 'two ways' distinction required for a truly proclamatory word. While it attempts to be contemporary, it remains in the realm of 'religious gestures' rather than concrete 'true truth'.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective use of the three parts (misery, redemption, gratitude) as a background framework for the characters.",
      "Clear attempt to interweave exposition and application by casting the congregation as participants in the narrative."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length and depth; fails the 20-minute rule for substantive preaching.",
      "The 'drama' metaphor softens the radicality of the Gospel into a set of 'roles' one can 'experiment' with, undermining the seriousness of God's calling.",
      "Lack of specific exegesis regarding the unique Markan context of this miracle."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate religious speech, but it is not yet a 'sermon' in the strict sense defined by Dekker. It lacks the specific 'nowhere else' quality of the Word and the necessary breadth of depth that requires at least 20 minutes of rigorous exposition and application."
