    "summary": "The sermon is intellectually stimulating and begins with a healthy Adult-Adult orientation. It successfully deconstructs power dynamics in the Naaman story. However, it concludes with a heavy-handed Critical Parent approach. By equating modern church members with Gehazi and threatening them with 'leprosy,' the preacher risks creating a culture of guilt-driven compliance (Adapted Child) rather than authentic, joyful generosity (Free Child).",

      "The use of fear-based motivation ('don't get leprosy') at the end.",
      "The direct shaming of 'insiders' can trigger defensive rebellion rather than reflection."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Instead of using Gehazi as a threat, invite the congregation's Adult to observe the difference in quality of life between Elisha and Gehazi. Let the listener choose the 'Shalom' because it is inherently better, not because they fear the 'leprosy' of the alternative."
