    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is exceptionally strong in grounding the biblical narrative in concrete human experience. It avoids abstract 'everyman' examples and instead uses visceral, sensory details. The preacher connects the biblical 'dark river' to specific life transitions—aging, illness, and professional shifts. The use of personal narrative (the glass vial of poison) creates a high level of emotional resonance and identification.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon pauses effectively to ask 'why' and 'who'. It explores the nature of life's transitions not just as events, but as existential problems. The preacher analyzes the human tendency to use 'protection mechanisms' (family, property) and reflects on the 'liberal error' of a harmless God. It looks at the problem of suffering from multiple perspectives (psychological, religious-historical, and personal).",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Theological depth is present but often subordinated to experience. The 'Big Idea'—that God is found in the struggle and the darkness—is clear. The exegesis of the name change (Jacob to Israel) and the unnamability of God provides a solid theological framework. However, the logical progression is sometimes secondary to the narrative flow, making the 'dogmatic' core feel more like an intuition than a structured argument.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the sermon calls for 'struggle' and 'prayer', the instructions remain somewhat general. The preacher mentions his own political activism (peace movement), which provides a model, but the specific 'how-to' for the average hearer is less clear. The call is more to a 'posture' (not giving up) than to a specific 'action step'.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of experiential preaching that avoids superficiality. It falls short only in the specificity of its practical application for the individual hearer, often pivoting to broad political categories. However, it succeeds in creating a profound 'Concrete Experience' through the use of sensory-rich personal narratives. The theological core (Abstract Conceptualization) is robust, successfully challenging a 'safe' view of God by presenting the 'God of the dark'. The movement through the phases is logical, though the 'Active Experimentation' phase is more modeled by the preacher's biography than taught as a method for the congregation. The balance leans toward the 'feeling' and 'watching' side of Kolb's cycle, making it highly resonant but slightly less 'pragmatic' in the traditional sense.",

      "Use more diverse 'Reflective' lenses, such as social-psychological data on life transitions."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong, peer-level example of how to use Kolb's cycle to address deep existential pain. Its primary strength lies in the 'Concrete Experience' and 'Reflective Observation' phases, where it achieves a score of 8 and 7 respectively. It effectively avoids the pitfall of 'moralistic tails' by embedding the call to action in the preacher's own life. However, for a model rating, it would require more precision in the 'Active Experimentation' phase for the average congregant. The diagnosis is a highly effective, experience-oriented sermon that prioritizes 'heart' and 'eyes' over 'hands' and 'head', yet maintains enough theological substance to avoid being merely sentimental."
