    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The factual content is secondary to the relational narrative. The 'Sache' (theological substance) is the transition from earthly life to the 'long home' of Ecclesiastes. Taylor provides biographical data points—Shepard’s roles in the PNBC, his public service in Washington, and his 40-year tenure at Mt. Olivet. However, the exegetical depth is minimal; the scripture is used as a poignant punctuation mark rather than an object of systematic exposition. The dogmatic focus is purely on the 'fides qua'—the lived faith and the hope of the afterlife. While clear, the blue side serves primarily as a skeleton for the emotional meat of the sermon, lacking the 'living Christ' focus Barth would demand in favor of a 'living friend' focus.",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Taylor reveals himself with profound vulnerability. This is not image management but a raw 'Selbstenthüllung'. He admits his own grief ('I come to weep and mourn') and his deep dependency on the deceased ('the closest thing to a brother'). There is a high degree of authenticity in his description of their shared history. He does not hide behind the 'titular head' role but quickly pivots to the 'fellow pastor' and 'friend'. The green side is dominant here; the preacher is not a detached observer but a fellow traveler in the valley of the shadow of death. His passion for the friendship is palpable and serves to validate the congregation's own grief.",

        "I come to weep and mourn over his fallen human form.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The relationship side is warm and inclusive. Taylor addresses specific individuals (Cille, Lorenza, Sammy) directly, creating a 'We-definition' of a shared family/community. He speaks 'at eye level', moving from the authority of the 'titular head' to the solidarity of a 'brother'. There is little 'relationship noise' because his tone matches the gravity and intimacy of the occasion. He defines the congregation (Mt. Olivet) as Shepard's 'romance', affirming their identity through their relationship with the deceased. The 'You-message' is one of shared loss and mutual support.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The appeal is the weakest side, which is appropriate for a funeral but requires scrutiny. There is no explicit 'demand' (Anspruch) for behavioral change, which is a strength in terms of avoiding moralism. However, the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is largely centered on the character of Shepard and the hope of a 'welcome table' rather than the work of God. The appeal is implicit: 'Remember him' and 'Hope as he hoped'. The theological 'Gift' is the assurance of Shepard's peace. It lacks a sharp call to faith for the living, focusing instead on the rest of the dead. The ratio is heavily skewed toward comfort, which, while pastoral, lacks the 'directional force' of a Gospel call.",

    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "Gardner C. Taylor delivers a masterclass in the 'funeral eulogy as sermon'. Psychologically, the sermon is a tour de force of the Green and Yellow sides. Taylor uses his own vulnerability (Green) to build a bridge of solidarity (Yellow) with the grieving family and congregation. Theologically, the sermon leans heavily on the 'fides qua'—the faith as lived and experienced by Marshall Shepard. From a Barthian perspective, there is a risk of 'psychologization' where the focus remains on the human friendship rather than the Divine Subject. However, the 'Sache' of the sermon—the transition to the 'long home'—is handled with such poetic and personal integrity that it transcends mere sentimentality. The congruence is exceptional; Taylor does not 'perform' grief, he inhabits it. The lack of a strong 'Red' side (Appeal) is a deliberate homiletical choice to prioritize 'Zuspruch' (Promise) in a moment of acute loss.",
    "barthian_warning": "High risk of psychologization. The sermon is more about 'Shep' and 'Gardner' than about the 'Living Christ', though Christ is the implied host of the 'welcome table'.",
