    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically complex. It avoids the 'smothering' Nurturing Parent of sentimental religion but replaces it with a formidable Critical Parent. It uses the Adult ego to deconstruct 'soft' theology, which promotes intellectual honesty. However, it risks traumatizing the 'Child' by glorifying a God of cataclysm and demanding self-despising humility. The final move to Jesus 'asleep in the boat' attempts to resolve the tension but may feel like a psychological 'patch' over the preceding terror.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The use of 'infinite insignificance' can be psychologically damaging/shaming.",
      "The transition from the 'God of Hurricanes' to 'Put your hand in the hand' is a sharp shift from CP to AC that lacks Adult integration."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward game-free communication, the preacher could invite the congregation's Adult to reflect on how to act responsibly in the face of power, rather than simply 'getting back in their place' (which is a Parent-Child command)."
