    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in 'showing' rather than just 'telling' by utilizing vivid, relatable analogies to explain abstract theological concepts. Keller employs the 'cinematic' quality advocated by Paul Scott Wilson, particularly in the narrative of David’s mighty men and the 'immoral table.' The imagery of the 'ocean of love' and the 'claustrophobia' of self-centeredness provides a sensory weight to the concept of holiness. However, the imagery is often functional (didactic) rather than purely poetic, serving to clarify the argument rather than solely to evoke mystery. The contrast between the 'stench' of the secular worldview and the 'gorgeous' holiness of Christ is effective but remains somewhat intellectually controlled.",
      "quotes": [
        "What does an immoral table look like? Would you want to eat at an immoral table?",
        "The claustrophobia of living for ourselves, the crampedness of it, the narrowness of spirit, the infinite regress of spiraling down on yourself.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Keller demonstrates high 'stewardship of language' as defined by McEntyre. He avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by explicitly addressing how words like 'sin' and 'holiness' are used ironically in modern culture. His precision in defining 'sober' and 'gird up your mind' shows a commitment to clarity and nuance. The language is economical; every illustration serves a specific logical step in the reframing process. He does justice to the complexity of the human condition (the 'New Yorker' perspective) without resorting to straw-man arguments, reflecting a 'loving language' that respects the listener’s intellect.",
      "quotes": [
        "In our modern culture, both the word sin and the word holiness are almost never used anymore except ironically. We talk about 'sinful chocolate.'",
        "It’s actually a word that would characterize the mindset of a scholar. You know how scholars are. A lot of footnotes, careful definitions.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The rhythm is distinctly 'oral' and conversational, fitting Gerrit Immink’s 'performance' aspect. There is a clear staccato rhythm in the interrogative sections ('Why? Because you’re not living for yourself'). However, the musicality is more rhetorical than poetic. It lacks the 'legato' of contemplative prose, leaning heavily on the 'staccato' of logical progression. While the ending reaches a more lyrical height with the hymn quote and the 'ocean' metaphor, much of the sermon is 'paper language' optimized for clarity rather than aesthetic 'flow' or cadence. It is a 'teaching' rhythm rather than a 'singing' rhythm.",
      "quotes": [
        "Charity, honesty, and industry. Care for the poor, always tell the truth, work hard.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by 'sober beauty' and intellectual precision. Keller avoids religious kitsch by rigorously defining his terms and using fresh, often humorous, analogies that bridge the gap between the biblical world and modern urban life. While the language is more functional than lyrical, its strength lies in its 'stewardship'—the careful, respectful use of words to reframe reality. It is an aesthetic of clarity, where the 'form' of the argument serves to open the 'content' of the gospel to a skeptical mind."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' as described by Lowry. It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with the problem of the word 'holiness' being lost to irony. The movement is not a static three-point list but a journey from the 'What' (definition) to the 'How' (process) to the 'Why' (motivation). The turning point is the shift from 'morality' to 'belonging,' which creates a palpable movement. The energy is sustained through the use of narrative (David's men) which acts as a 'scene' within the larger drama. The conclusion offers a resolution in the person of Christ, though it is somewhat predictable for the genre.",
      "quotes": [
        "Today we come to a well-known, very important theme and one we have to come to grips with: holiness.",
        "It’s a quote from the Old Testament. He’s quoting Leviticus. There are a lot of reasons why it’s strange to have Peter quoting Leviticus.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength, embodying Cilliers' 'Reframing.' Keller takes the 'strangeness' of Leviticus (holy pots and tables) and uses it to reframe the modern hearer's understanding of their own life. He connects the 'then' of the Tabernacle with the 'now' of a New York office (Ephesians 6 integration) seamlessly. The 'reframing' of the secular person's 'peace through not thinking' is a brilliant aesthetic move that forces the hearer to see their own reality through a new lens. It respects the 'otherness' of the text while making it urgently relevant.",
      "quotes": [
        "What does the word holy mean? The Hebrew word originally means separate, set apart.",
        "You don’t believe in God and you’re telling me that you are getting your peace by not thinking out the implications...?",
        "The reason Peter quotes from Leviticus is he has figured this out. To be holy means you belong to God."

      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant synthesis of Levitical 'ceremonial' holiness with modern 'relational' identity.",
        "The 'reframing' of the secular worldview as 'not thinking' is a powerful aesthetic reversal.",
        "Organic transition from the biblical text to the contemporary workplace."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could further explore the 'foreigner/exile' metaphor from the text in the context of modern urban loneliness.",
        "The 'reframing' could be even more radical by addressing the 'reverent fear' with more aesthetic depth.",
        "Ensure the 'reframing' doesn't become a purely intellectual exercise."

      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing present; the sermon consistently offers a new lens to view morality and identity."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "In terms of Stark's 'Open Work of Art,' the sermon is somewhat 'closed.' It is a masterclass in 'witnessing' and 'teaching,' but it leaves relatively little room for the hearer's own interpretation or 'resistance.' The logic is so tight that it can feel coercive—a 'sealed system' of truths. However, it opens 'space' by acknowledging the difficulty of the concept and by ending with an invitation to 'look' at the 'gorgeous' holiness of Christ. It treats the hearer as a 'mature conversation partner' by engaging their intellect, but the 'happy ending' (the resolution in grace) is presented as the only logical conclusion.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s obvious that we need to take it seriously. So let’s ask the most fundamental questions.",
        "I guess for us today the idea of being holy sounds cramped. It sounds stuffy.",
        "So look at it until it makes you holy."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the hearer's potential 'resistance' to the words 'sin' and 'holiness'.",
        "The ending is an invitation ('look at it') rather than a strict moral command.",
        "The use of questions throughout the sermon invites the hearer into the process of discovery."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Allow for more 'ambivalence'—what does it feel like when holiness feels impossible?",
        "The conclusion could be more 'open-ended' to allow the Spirit more room for individual appropriation.",
        "Reduce the 'coercive' nature of the logical 'if-then' structures."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent and 'closed' due to its strong logical-apologetic drive, but with 'open' windows of invitation."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics of the sermon are defined by a compelling 'Reframing' of reality. Keller moves the hearer from a defensive, ironic stance toward 'holiness' to a position of wonder before the 'gorgeous' sacrifice of Christ. The dramaturgy is driven by intellectual discovery and narrative illustration. While the structure is logically 'tight' and leans toward a closed system, it successfully creates an 'event' where the hearer is forced to confront the implications of their own worldview in light of the Gospel."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. Keller avoids 'pre-chewed emotions' and 'cheap comfort.' He takes the 'pain' of the human condition (the claustrophobia of the self) seriously. The 'happy ending' is not a clichéd resolution but a 'gorgeous' theological reality that requires intense 'thinking.' He avoids the 'sentiment' of typical 'God loves you' messages by grounding that love in the 'precious blood' and the 'infinite cost' to Christ. The 'anti-kitsch' quality is found in the 'sober' and 'judicious' tone that respects the gravity of the subject matter.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential for kitsch in the 'mother-son' story is avoided by focusing on the 'repulsive' logic of the son rather than just the mother's tears.",
      "The 'sinful chocolate' reference effectively mocks cultural kitsch to clear the way for authentic depth."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'infinite regress of spiraling down on yourself' feels like an authentic phenomenological observation of modern life.",
      "The 'sigh' of David for the water—representing a longing for home—reaches a level of authentic human emotion."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the 'sober' tone while allowing for more moments of 'poetic lament' to further distance the message from any potential for sentimentality."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'Reframing' of holiness as 'belonging' rather than 'achieving.' By defining holiness as a 'gift' (the blood of Christ) rather than a 'task,' Keller creates a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers). However, the 'dogmatically sealed' nature of the logic occasionally threatens to close this space by making grace seem like a 'logical necessity' rather than a 'startling mystery.' The 'mystery' of the 'fear of God' is acknowledged but quickly 'explained,' which slightly diminishes the sense of the 'unavailable' Holy.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'morality' and 'holiness' is well-sustained until the final resolution in Christ.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery is somewhat subordinated to clarity, though the 'gorgeousness' of Christ at the end restores some sense of wonder.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the sermon explicitly deconstructs moralization ('it is not enough to be moral').",
    "recommendation": "Allow for more 'unresolved' mystery in the liturgy of the word—let the 'fear of God' remain a bit more 'awesome' before explaining it as 'awe'."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.3,
    "summary": "This sermon is a sophisticated example of 'Apologetic-Reframing' aesthetics. Its beauty lies not in baroque ornamentation or emotional manipulation, but in the 'sober beauty' of clarity and the 'poetic power' of a well-constructed argument. Keller functions as a 'witness' (Long) who uses language as a 'steward' (McEntyre) to clear away the 'kitsch' of modern irony and moralism. The aesthetic 'event' (Immink) occurs when the hearer realizes that the 'cramped' life they are living is the result of 'not thinking,' and that 'holiness' is actually the 'freedom' of belonging to the 'gorgeous' Other. While the structure is logically 'closed' and the rhythm is more 'academic' than 'musical,' the sermon successfully 'reframes' the biblical text for a contemporary audience, creating a genuine 'Space for Grace' through the deconstruction of self-centeredness.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "The 'Reframing' of holiness from 'morality' to 'belonging' using the Levitical context.",
      "The 'Anti-Kitsch' precision of language that respects the hearer's intellect.",
      "The effective use of narrative (David's men) to illustrate 'delight-based' obedience."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase the 'musicality' and poetic cadence of the prose to move beyond 'paper language'.",
      "Allow for more 'openness' and 'ambivalence' in the conclusion to reduce the coercive feel of the logic.",
      "Incorporate more sensory 'imagery' (smell, touch, sound) to deepen the 'cinematic' experience."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Academic-Declarative",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Kitsch), Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Four Pages), Thomas G. Long (Preacher as Witness).",
    "audience_analysis": "Urban professionals, skeptics, and 'intellectual' believers who value logical consistency and the deconstruction of religious clichés.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'narrative-dramatic' structure where the 'plot' is less overtly explained.",
      "Use more 'open endings' that leave the hearer with a lingering, 'polyvalent' question.",
      "Focus on the 'musicality' of the text's own language (e.g., the rhythm of 1 Peter's Greek-inspired prose)."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically strong 'Open Work' in terms of its conceptual reach, even if its formal structure remains 'closed' by its apologetic intent. It achieves the 'Aesthetic Turn' by proving that *how* holiness is defined (through the imagery of belonging and the narrative of sacrifice) is inseparable from *what* holiness is. It is a model of 'sober beauty' that avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch, successfully opening a 'Space for Grace' in the midst of a skeptical, 'ironic' culture."
