    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon lacks a contemporary 'slice of life' or a personal narrative hook. It begins with a historical-imaginary reconstruction of Jeremiah's family. While vivid, it remains at a distance from the hearer's immediate emotional experience. The 'feeling' level is addressed through the personification of God (God's happiness/delight), but the hearer is invited to observe a scene rather than find themselves in one. The connection to the 'urban economy' is the closest the text gets to the hearer's life world, but it remains somewhat sociological.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest phase. It excels at analyzing the human condition and the 'problem' of self-deception. It pauses to ask why societies and individuals gravitate toward wisdom, power, and wealth. It offers a sharp cultural critique of the 'urban fantasy of security' and explores the underlying patterns of 'self-aggrandizement.' The preacher acts as a sage, helping the hearer look at their own world through a critical, reflective lens.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a clear theological framework by contrasting two triads: (Wisdom, Power, Wealth) vs (Steadfast Love, Justice, Righteousness). The exegesis of the word 'halal' (boast) provides a linguistic anchor. The connection between Jeremiah and Paul's theology of the cross is logically sound and provides a 'big idea': the gospel as a 'radical alternative life.' However, the exegesis is more thematic than verse-by-verse, focusing on the concepts rather than the textual mechanics.",
      "quotes": [

      "analysis": "This phase is the least developed. While the sermon calls for 'subversion' and 'choosing what makes God happy,' the applications remain largely abstract or general. Suggestions like 'sign on for the community' or 'brag a little' lack the specificity required for 'Active Experimentation.' The call to 'get honest' is a psychological/internal action, but the sermon stops short of providing concrete 'how-to' steps for living out justice or steadfast love in a specific urban context.",

The logical structure is clear, and the theological integration of Jeremiah and Paul is effective. However, the sermon falls short in Concrete Experience and Active Experimentation. It remains largely in the realm of ideas and historical imagination, failing to provide the hearer with a contemporary 'hook' or concrete action steps. The result is a sermon that informs and inspires the mind but may fail to transform daily practice. It is an 'Assimilating' sermon that serves the intellectual hearer well but leaves the 'Converging' and 'Accommodating' hearers without a clear path forward.",

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a robust theological analysis that successfully diagnoses the 'habits of death' in modern society. From a Kolb perspective, it is a high-quality 'Assimilating' and 'Diverging' piece, offering deep reflection and a compelling vision. Its primary weakness lies in its lack of 'concreteness'—both in the initial experience and the final application. It operates in the 'Prophetic' mode, which is effective for challenging worldviews, but it lacks the 'Pastoral' or 'Pragmatic' mode necessary to help adult learners bridge the gap between insight and action. To move from a 6.2 to an 8.0, the preacher must focus on the 'bottom' half of the Kolb cycle: grounding the sermon in the hearer's lived reality and providing a clear, practical response."
