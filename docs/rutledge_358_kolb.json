    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a concrete literary and cultural experience—a book review and a Gershwin song—to ground the hearer in the contemporary 'climate of doubt.' However, it lacks a deep personal 'slice of life' until the very end with the story of Cook Kimball. The initial engagement is intellectual-cultural rather than visceral-emotional. The hearer is invited to identify with the 'Corinthian drift,' but this remains somewhat abstract until the funeral narrative provides a tangible human connection.",

        "It all reminds me of the words of the Gershwin song, 'The things that you're liable to read in the Bible/ It ain't necessarily so.'",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon is strong in analyzing the human condition of skepticism. It pauses to ask 'why' the Bible is being debunked and reflects on the shift in biblical archaeology over forty years. It explores the problem of 'believing in vain' from multiple perspectives—Paul's, the modern scholar's, and the parent's. It effectively identifies the 'problem' as the reduction of revelation to human imagination.",
      "quotes": [
        "Reading her review has been a good reminder for me that things have changed since I was in theological school.",
        "But now let us be realistic. The point of view expressed in the book review is now so widely held within the church that it is a full-time job to plug even one hole in the dike."

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest quadrant. It provides a rigorous logical breakdown of 1 Corinthians 15. The preacher acts as a 'Philosopher/Advocate,' formulating the 'big idea' that the Gospel is an announcement of events, not generic principles. The exegesis is solid, connecting the Resurrection to the Old Testament ('in accordance with the scriptures') and defining the definitive theological shaping of the New Testament.",
      "quotes": [

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is weakest here. While it issues a call to parents and teachers to 'shoulder the responsibility' of teaching the Bible, the application remains somewhat general. It tells the hearer *what* to believe (the Resurrection is a fact) and *that* they should teach it, but offers little 'practical wisdom' or 'how-to' for the daily life of a person struggling with these doubts.",
      "quotes": [

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong example of the 'Declarative' style, effectively addressing the intellectual challenges of modern skepticism. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon—rich in reflection and conceptualization but thin on application. It succeeds in making the 'truth' clear but is less successful in showing the hearer how to 'live the truth' in a concrete way. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'miraculous revelation' and the daily 'active experimentation' of the believer."
