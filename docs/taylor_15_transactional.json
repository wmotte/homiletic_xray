    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The sermon largely avoids games because the 'payoff' is not a negative feeling (guilt/superiority) but rather an invitation to 'Mature Wisdom' and 'Faith.' It lacks the 'Switch' to Persecutor that characterizes most pulpit games."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and sophisticated. It utilizes high-quality Nurturing Parent and Free Child language to engage the listener's emotions before transitioning into an Adult assessment of reality. It avoids the common 'NIGYSOB' game by framing sin as a 'fatal weakness' and 'overstretching' rather than a reason for the preacher to attack the audience. The primary psychological movement is from the 'Adapted Child' (clinging to a safe past) to the 'Adult' (facing an uncertain future with faith).",
    "strengths": [
      "High use of Free Child imagery to create authentic connection.",
      "Avoidance of shaming tactics (Critical Parent).",
      "Clear Adult-level analysis of social realities (racism, nationalism)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the 'First Eden' to the 'New Eden' relies heavily on poetic abstraction; more 'Adult' concrete steps for the 'arduous way' could be provided.",
      "The 'Woe to us' warning is a brief lapse into Critical Parent that feels slightly disconnected from the otherwise nurturing tone."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to validate the 'Child's' feelings while strengthening the 'Adult's' agency. To ensure the communication remains game-free, ensure the 'New Eden' is not presented as a magical 'Rescuer' but as a reality that requires the listener's 'Adult' participation."
