  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses 1 Samuel 16 and 2 Corinthians 5. However, it treats the Samuel passage as a 'fairy tale' or a general illustration of 'not being deceived by appearances.' It fails to identify what is unique to this specific text that cannot be found elsewhere. It leans toward a 'biblical idea' (anti-stereotyping) rather than the specific proclamatory word of the pericope.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is an innocent little fairy tale about how a runt became a king.",
        "This is a story of not being deceived by appearance..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the specific theological weight of David's election in the history of Israel's covenant, rather than reducing it to a general lesson on 'not judging by looks.'"
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is superficial. The preacher summarizes the narrative but lacks depth in Hebrew context or the specific theology of the Books of Samuel. The comparison to 'Republican candidates' and 'beauty contests' modernizes the text too quickly, bypassing the rigorous exposition Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is like all of the Republican candidates who parade in front of the big donors like a beauty contest."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Engage with the specific meaning of 'the heart' (lebab) in the Hebrew context and the tension between the charismatic judgeship and the institutional monarchy."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is contemporary and addresses the zeitgeist (wealth gap, racism, cosmetic surgery). It is concrete in its social critique, which aligns with Dekker's requirement for a broad knowledge of the humanities and sociology.",
      "quotes": [
        "Elsewise why so much money spent on cosmetic surgery and excessive narcissistic self-care?",
        "The growing wealth gap... and the ongoing war against the 'undeserving poor'..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid turning the application into a list of social grievances; ground the 'new creation' more firmly in the specific congregational life."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is strictly partitioned into Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV). This is exactly what Dekker warns against: separating exposition and application. The hearer is first given a 'fairy tale' and then a 'contextual' analysis, rather than being drawn into the text in one movement.",
      "quotes": [
        "So that’s the story. ... So we must ask, how shall we hear this story in our context?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Dissolve the numbered sections. Let the contemporary critique emerge directly from the unfolding of the biblical narrative."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is present as social 'slottedness' and 'categorization.' Redemption is seen as 'social possibility.' However, the 'misery' is more sociological than theological (misery before God). The 'gratitude' is framed as social action rather than a Spirit-awakened response to grace.",
      "quotes": [
        "God has reached out to us in our nothingness and made us new. And we may do the same where we live."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the sense of 'misery' beyond social stereotypes to the radical lostness of the human heart before God."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are present in the contrast between 'norms of death' and 'new life,' but the seriousness of being 'lost' is softened. It leans toward the liberal tradition of collective social destruction ('society will perish') rather than the individual responsibility Dekker emphasizes.",
      "quotes": [
        "resist and nullify and overcome the norms of the world that are the norms of death."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the hearer as a 'willing and responsible being' who faces a choice that matters for eternity, not just social progress."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the 'telos' of the Davidic line and the 'new creation,' but the sermon risks making Christ a symbol for a 'new social reality' rather than the ontological Lord. The doctrine of the two natures is not felt.",
      "quotes": [
        "the Messiah who came in the flesh of Jesus, also a nobody from Nazareth..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure Christ is the goal that detaches man from himself, rather than a means to achieve social reconciliation."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1450 words, the sermon would likely clock in under 15 minutes in a liturgical setting. According to Dekker, this lacks the 'breadth' required for 'depth.'",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical and dogmatic sections to reach the 20-minute threshold, allowing the text to breathe."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily due to its structural separation of text and application and its reduction of the biblical narrative to a sociological lesson. It functions more as a social commentary using biblical motifs than an actualization of the Word of God. While it correctly identifies the zeitgeist's obsession with appearance, it lacks the exegetical rigor and the 'two ways' seriousness Dekker demands.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete contemporary application regarding the wealth gap and social categorization.",
      "Clear identification of the 'zeitgeist' in its collective workings."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Structural separation of exposition and application (Thesis 4).",
      "Insufficient length for the required depth (Thesis 8).",
      "Lack of specific exegesis of the Hebrew/Greek context (Thesis 2).",
      "Theological misery is replaced by sociological disadvantage (Thesis 5)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate social address, but it is not yet a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It lacks the necessary breadth, the interwoven movement of revelation, and the specific 'nowhere else' quality of the biblical text."
