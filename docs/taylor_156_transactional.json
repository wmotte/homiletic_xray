It does not use 'NIGYSOB' because it doesn't hunt for sins; it doesn't use 'ITHY' because it doesn't offer a 'fix' that the preacher controls.

    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is exceptionally healthy from a TA perspective. It avoids the common trap of the Critical Parent (shaming) and instead uses the Adult ego state to process historical and biblical data. By doing so, it respects the listener's intelligence. The transition into the Free Child at the end provides an authentic, non-coerced emotional lift. It promotes autonomy by framing faith as a conscious 'outlook' rather than a forced submission.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement through historical context.",
      "Avoidance of the Drama Triangle; the preacher does not play the Rescuer.",
      "High Free Child energy that invites joy without using guilt as a catalyst."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'test' at the beginning could lean slightly into Critical Parent if the listener feels they 'failed' the test, though the preacher's tone mitigates this.",
      "The transition from historical tragedy (Babylon) to future glory is very rapid, which might bypass the 'Adult' processing of current, real-world pain."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' to provide context and the 'Free Child' to share vision. To remain game-free, ensure that the 'Nurturing Parent' doesn't become 'Smothering' by acknowledging the difficulty of the 'wait' for the 'About-to-be'."
