    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. It utilizes a 'Rescue' dynamic that reinforces dependency. By framing human agency ('eigen meningen', 'voor jezelf opkomen') as inherently sinful or 'braking', it pushes the listener into a permanent Adapted Child state. While theologically 'orthodox' in its focus on grace, the psychological impact is one of passivity: the listener is a passive train car being pulled, rather than an Adult agent in a covenantal relationship.",

      "The use of fear (fire/judgment) as a 'Con' to sell the 'Rescue'."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the listener as an Adult partner in God's work. Instead of 'Jesus does everything, you just follow,' try 'In light of what Jesus has done, how will you as a responsible Adult choose to act today?' This moves from the Drama Triangle to the Winners Triangle (from Rescuer to Helper, from Victim to Creator)."
