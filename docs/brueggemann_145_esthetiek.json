    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon relies heavily on the imagery already present in the biblical texts (shepherd, oil, table, leaping lame man) rather than generating new, contemporary metaphors. While it 'paints' the biblical scene of the lame man, it functions more as a commentary on existing images than a creative imagistic event. The 'pronoun' metaphor is grammatical and abstract, serving as a structural scaffold rather than a sensory experience. According to Paul Scott Wilson's 'show, don't tell,' this sermon leans heavily toward 'telling' the meaning of the biblical images rather than 'showing' how they manifest in the hearer's modern reality. The sensory potential of 'oil' or 'still waters' is mentioned but not expanded upon to evoke a visceral response.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and disciplined. Following McEntyre’s stewardship of language, the preacher treats words—specifically pronouns—with high regard. There is a clear avoidance of 'Canaanite' jargon; even theological concepts like 'sacramental' or 'resurrection' are framed within the logic of the relationship between 'I', 'You', and 'We'. The sentence structure is clean and economical. However, the precision sometimes borders on the academic, feeling like a well-delivered lecture. The nuance of the 'authority of Rome' vs. 'authority of Jesus' shows a careful political-theological distinction that avoids platitudes.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a rhythmic quality through the use of repetition and parallelism, particularly in the litany of 'You' and 'I' statements. This creates a liturgical cadence that aids memorability. However, the rhythm is somewhat interrupted by the pedagogical signposting ('I.', 'II.', 'III.'). The sentence length is varied, but the overall tone is more 'staccato' (didactic) than 'legato' (poetic). It sounds like 'oral language' designed for a pulpit, but it lacks the lyrical 'flow' that Grözinger associates with the highest aesthetic power of the Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "You make me lie down in safety; You lead me beside still waters; You restore my soul...",

    "average_score_language": 6.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' and pedagogical precision. It excels in clarity and stewardship of the word, avoiding the pitfalls of vague religious jargon. However, it remains aesthetically 'safe,' relying on the inherent beauty of the biblical text rather than generating its own poetic momentum. The grammatical metaphor is a strong intellectual hook but lacks sensory depth. It is a highly 'literate' sermon that appeals to the mind's eye through structure rather than the heart's ear through lyricism."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The structure is a classic 'teaching' arc rather than a 'narrative' arc. It follows a deductive pattern (Point I, II, III, IV) which, while clear, lacks the 'upsetting of equilibrium' that Lowry advocates. The tension is intellectual: 'What do these pronouns mean for us?' The movement is a steady climb of cumulative information rather than a dramatic journey. The turning point is not a sudden 'aha' moment but a gradual synthesis in the final section. Energy is maintained through the novelty of the grammatical lens, but there is no palpable 'conflict' or 'plot' that keeps the listener on the edge of their seat.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The integration is the sermon's strongest structural suit. It successfully 'reframes' (Cilliers) the biblical texts through the lens of modern identity ('consumer society of selfies'). The connection between the 'I' of the gospel and the 'I' of the selfie is a creative synthesis that offers a new perspective. It respects the 'strangeness' of the text (e.g., the political nature of the crucifixion) while making it relevant to the hearer's sense of 'self-sufficiency' or 'despair'. The transition from the ancient 'You' of the Psalm to the modern 'arrogant self-sufficiency' is organic and insightful.",
      "quotes": [
        "We now live in a consumer society of selfies in which it is easy enough to imagine that we... is the center of the universe.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is relatively 'closed' in its pedagogical intent—it wants the hearer to accept these three pronouns as 'indispensable.' However, it leaves room for the hearer to diagnose their own life: 'Easter is a good time to see how it is for us with these pronouns.' This invitation to self-reflection prevents it from being purely moralistic. Following Ciska Stark, the sermon is 'polyvalent' in that it touches on intimacy, politics, and social action, allowing different hearers to enter through different 'pronouns.' Yet, the conclusion is quite definitive, resolving the 'complexity' into a 'good news' statement that leaves little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' mentioned by Cilliers.",
      "quotes": [
        "Easter is a good time to see how it is for us with these pronouns.",
        "I have called these three pronouns indispensable for faith...",

      "strengths": [
        "The 'diagnostic' section (Part IV) invites the hearer's active participation.",

        "End with an image or a question that lingers rather than a summary statement."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Semi-open. It is a 'guided interpretation' that allows for personal application but insists on a specific theological framework."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is that of a master teacher. It is structured with architectural clarity, moving from the 'You' of God to the 'I' of Christ to the 'We' of the community. While it lacks the dramatic tension of a narrative 'plot,' it compensates with a compelling 'reframing' of modern identity. The integration of four different biblical texts into a single grammatical metaphor is an aesthetic feat of synthesis, though the rigid signposting occasionally hinders the 'event' character of the preaching."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'pre-chewed' emotions and easy 'happy endings.' By acknowledging the 'predatory power of the Roman Empire' and the 'valley of the shadow of death,' it takes the pain of reality seriously. The comfort offered is not sentimental but grounded in the 'loss of Friday.' There is no manipulative language; the preacher does not try to 'force' a feeling of joy but rather builds a logical case for it. The 'selfie' reference is a bit of a contemporary cliché, but it is used analytically rather than sentimentally.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'selfie' reference is borderline clichéd, but used here as a social diagnostic rather than a sentimental trope.",
      "The 'jumping, leaping' ending could feel kitschy if not grounded in the preceding analysis of suffering and execution."

      "The discussion of Jesus' execution as a contradiction of 'predatory power'.",
      "The admission that without the 'You' of God, life 'floats off into despair'."

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by shifting the focus away from the 'self' (the selfie) to the 'I' of Jesus and the 'You' of God. Cilliers' 'Space for Grace' is created here through the 'between-ness' of the pronouns—the relationship is where grace happens. The sermon avoids heavy moralism ('we must do better') by framing the 'We' as a 'participation' in Easter power. However, the 'grammatical' framework is so tight that it occasionally 'crowds' the mystery with explanation. The 'inscrutable mystery' is mentioned, but the sermon spends most of its time 'scrutinizing' it.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between despair and hope are sustained well in the final diagnostic section.",
    "mystery_respected": "Partially. The mystery is named, but the pedagogical structure tends to categorize it.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. The 'We' is presented as a 'missional capacity' and 'joy' rather than a burdensome law.",
    "recommendation": "Allow for moments of silence or 'unexplained' imagery to let the 'Space for Grace' breathe outside the grammatical metaphor."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically 'sober' and intellectually 'elegant' piece of homiletic craft. Its primary aesthetic strength lies in its **structural synthesis**—the ability to weave four disparate lectionary texts into a single, coherent grammatical metaphor. This is 'Reframing' in the sense of Johan Cilliers: it takes the familiar (pronouns) and uses them to look at the Holy in a new way. The language is characterized by **stewardship and precision** (McEntyre), avoiding the 'kitsch' of sentimentalism in favor of a robust, slightly political 'Easter business.' \n\nHowever, the sermon's aesthetic is more 'Academic-Declarative' than 'Poetic-Imagistic.' It speaks to the mind and the 'will' more than the 'senses.' While it avoids being 'paper language,' it retains the flavor of a high-level lecture. The 'Space for Grace' is opened through the removal of the 'arrogant self,' but the rigid pedagogical signposting (I, II, III, IV) slightly constrains the 'event' character of the worship service as described by Immink. It is a 'strong' sermon (score 6-7) that functions as a clear witness, but it stops short of being a 'model' of poetic or narrative power.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful synthesis of multiple biblical texts through a single, accessible metaphor (the pronouns).",
      "Authentic, non-sentimental handling of Easter joy, grounded in the reality of the crucifixion.",
      "Precise, disciplined use of language that respects the hearer's intelligence."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase sensory imagery to 'show' the reality of the Gospel rather than just 'telling' its grammar.",

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Academic-Declarative / Sober-Reformed",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the style of Thomas G. Long (Form follows text/Preacher as witness) and Walter Brueggemann (Socio-rhetorical reframing).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'literate' hearers who appreciate intellectual clarity, biblical synthesis, and a rejection of sentimentalism.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a 'Lowry Loop' structure to introduce more narrative tension.",
      "Incorporate one 'deep' contemporary story that mirrors the 'leaping man' to ground the 'We' section.",
      "Read the text aloud to identify where the 'pedagogical' tone can be replaced with 'lyrical' tone."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Through the lens of homiletic aesthetics, this sermon is a successful 'Open Work of Art' in its diagnostic application, but a 'Closed Work' in its pedagogical delivery. It excels in 'Reframing' the biblical witness against the 'kitsch' of modern selfie-culture. It is a work of 'sober beauty' that prioritizes the clarity of the Word over the 'aestheticism' of the preacher. While it could benefit from more 'musicality' and 'imagery,' it stands as a robust example of how language care and structural integrity can create a 'Space for Grace' in a contemporary context."
