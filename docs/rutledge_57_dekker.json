I see the headstones of my Sunday school teachers, Mrs. Sue McCann and “Miss Lizzie” Smith. [...] May we, so to speak, wrap our faces like Elijah — wrap our faces in thanksgiving, in adoration, in awe and in humility before the presence of the Lord. AMEN."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon stays close to the narrative arc of 1 Kings 19. However, it misses the 'unique' point of this passage by turning it into a general lesson about 'still small voices' vs. 'big displays,' which is a common biblical trope. It fails to identify what is in this text that can be found NOWHERE else.",
      "quotes": [
        "Today we’re going to think about the prophet Elijah.",
        "There is a major lesson here about the nature of God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more sharply on the specific theological crisis of Elijah's 'comedown' after Carmel as a unique moment of prophetic transition, rather than a general psychological study."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The exegesis is primarily narrative retelling with psychological overlays. There is no evidence of the 'Hebrew and Greek' requirement or deep engagement with the religious history of Israel (e.g., the significance of Horeb as a Sinai-parallel).",
      "quotes": [
        "Among other things, this is sound psychology.",
        "Anger causes depression, you know — maybe Elijah is angry with the Lord."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the historical-theological weight of Horeb/Sinai and the specific covenantal implications of the 'seven thousand' in Israel's history."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application is concrete in its references (Ann Coulter, Saving Private Ryan), but these function more as illustrations than as a direct application of the text's specific word to the congregation's spiritual life. It borders on general truths about 'still voices.'",
      "quotes": [
        "I can’t help thinking of Ann Coulter.",
        "These were not big voices. They were still, small voices."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond political commentary or nostalgia to apply the text to the specific 'misery' or 'lostness' of the modern hearer's vocation."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon moves back and forth between the story and contemporary examples fairly well. It avoids the 'block' structure, though the introductory nostalgia is detached from the text's actual gravity.",
      "quotes": [
        "That’s just like Elijah, isn’t it? Burn up all the enemies!"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the contemporary examples serve to 'expound' the hearer in light of the text, rather than just illustrating a theme."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is present as psychological depression and 'grandiosity.' Redemption is seen in God's gentleness. However, the 'misery' lacks the depth of being 'before God'—it is treated more as a 'colossal comedown' or burnout.",
      "quotes": [
        "Elijah is deflated, demoralized, and depressed.",
        "The Lord is gentle with Elijah. Instead of reproaching him, the Lord sends an angel."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' from psychological burnout to the theological despair of a failed covenantal mission."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon lacks the 'two ways' almost entirely. There is no sense of the urgency of being lost or the ultimate consequences of human choice. God is presented as 'gentle' and 'good' without the counterpoint of judgment.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Lord is very good to Elijah.",
        "The Lord is present here... because that is what he promised."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the reality of the 'broad way' that Jezebel represents and the serious consequences of the people's 'fickle' choice to return to Baal."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the 'telos' at the end, but the connection to the 1 Kings text feels forced through a Luke 9 parallel rather than emerging from the text itself. The 'two natures' doctrine is not operative.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Son of God, the incarnate Word, has not come in fire... His power is of another sort."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Show how the 'still small voice' in 1 Kings 19 specifically points to the necessity of Christ's incarnation and suffering, rather than just using Jesus as a moral contrast to Elijah's violence."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 14 minutes (1450 words), the sermon fails Dekker's 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for 'depth.'",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical and dogmatic sections to reach the 20-minute threshold, allowing for a more thorough 'exposition' of the text."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily due to its brevity and its reliance on psychological interpretation over theological exegesis. It lacks the 'two ways' and the necessary depth of 'misery' before God. While it attempts to be concrete, it often settles for general truths about God's quietness.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective narrative flow that keeps the biblical story central.",
      "Concrete contemporary references (though some are dated) that avoid purely abstract speech."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (14 min) prevents the 'breadth' Dekker demands.",
      "Over-reliance on psychology ('sound psychology', 'depression') replaces theological exposition.",
      "Absence of the 'two ways' or the seriousness of being lost."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an 'adequate' speech about a biblical character, but according to Dekker’s strict formal definition, it is not yet a 'sermon' because it lacks the necessary breadth (duration), the rigor of original-language exegesis, and the essential tension of the two ways."
