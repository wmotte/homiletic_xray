  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust, primarily operating from the Adult ego state. It avoids the common pulpit trap of the Critical Parent shaming the Adapted Child. By using cultural touchstones (Johnny Cash, Václav Havel), the preacher anchors theological concepts in 'here-and-now' reality. The emphasis on 'purgation' and 'refiner's fire' could risk becoming Persecutory, but the preacher successfully frames it as a universal human need for integrity rather than a targeted strike against the audience. The result is a call to autonomy and wakefulness.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "Inclusion of the preacher in the 'household of God' subject to judgment.",
      "High reality-testing against current events."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Ain't it Awful' dynamic regarding shopping/culture is a bit cliché.",
      "The transition from political analysis to 'purgatory' is a sharp shift that might leave some listeners in a confused Child state."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' instead of 'you' when discussing judgment. Ensure the 'Free Child' joy in the conclusion is given as much weight as the 'Adult' sobriety of the introduction to avoid a heavy 'Parental' payoff."
