    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely game-free. It utilizes a Nurturing Parent stance to build the listener's self-worth and an Adult stance to provide a cognitive framework for faith. By framing the Christian life as a 'work in progress' within a 'love letter,' it bypasses the typical guilt-driven cycles found in many Advent sermons. The preacher avoids the Drama Triangle by positioning God as the faithful initiator and the listener as a joyful participant rather than a victim of sin or a servant of the preacher's ego.",

      "Strong affirmation of the listener's intrinsic value ('Angels danced').",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The contrast with the 'commercial orgy' could lean into 'Ain't It Awful' if expanded too far.",
      "The closing questions ('Are you ready?') risk triggering the Adapted Child's fear of inadequacy."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize the 'already/not yet' tension as a source of 'gladness' rather than 'anxiety' to keep the listener in the Adult/Free Child positions."
