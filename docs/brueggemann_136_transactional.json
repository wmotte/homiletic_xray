  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, engaging the listener's intellect and agency. By exposing the 'trick' of the lectionary, the preacher empowers the congregation with knowledge rather than keeping them in a dependent Child state. The use of personal narrative serves to humanize the speaker, fostering a sense of shared journey rather than hierarchical instruction.",

      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "Empowers the listener through biblical literacy.",
      "Avoids the use of guilt as a primary motivator."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'summons' to 'get your mind off yourself' could potentially be heard by a fragile 'Adapted Child' as a Critical Parent command if not delivered with the current warmth.",
      "The political framing of the 'Roman electric chair' is a strong Adult stimulus that might trigger a 'Rebellious Child' response in some listeners, though it remains a valid reality-test."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'we' pronoun to maintain the shared Adult journey. Ensure that the 'invitation' to the journey remains an invitation and doesn't slide into a 'must' (Critical Parent) during the emotional climax of Holy Week."
