        "analysis": "The preacher avoids 'must' and 'should' in a moralistic sense. Coercion is replaced by 'vocation' and 'calling'. There is a brief CP moment regarding 'greed and folly' and 'heedless rapacity' toward the environment, but it serves a larger narrative rather than shaming the individual listener.",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in homiletics. By grounding the discourse in the 'Adult' reality of mortality and institutional decline, the preacher avoids the 'Critical Parent' trap of demanding growth or 'Adapted Child' trap of pleading for relevance. Instead, it uses the 'Free Child' to invite the listener into an authentic experience of beauty and 'wonder.' The impact is one of liberation rather than burden-bearing.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of transparency and Adult-Adult engagement.",
      "Successful integration of the Free Child's capacity for joy and play ('the dance').",
      "Refusal to use guilt as a motivator for church attendance or offerings."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to environmental 'rapacity' is a brief 'Critical Parent' flash that feels slightly disconnected from the otherwise 'Free Child' tone.",
      "Could further empower the Adult by asking more reflective questions rather than providing all the 'meanings' of the symbols."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to validate the 'Adult' reality of the listeners (their fears, their observations of the world) before inviting them into the 'Free Child' experience of worship. This ensures the joy is not a form of 'Child' escapism but an 'Adult' choice."
