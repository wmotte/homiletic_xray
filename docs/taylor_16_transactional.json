        "analysis": "The preacher avoids the traditional CP role of condemning doubt. Instead of 'You must believe,' the preacher suggests 'A person can lose one's faith... if he is not careful,' which is more of a cautionary Adult observation than a CP command.",

    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and exceptionally healthy. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent (shaming the doubter) and the Rescuer (promising miracles that don't come). By speaking from an Adult/Nurturing Parent position, the preacher fosters a sense of 'I'm OK, You're OK' even in the midst of suffering. It validates the 'Free Child's' right to scream or complain, which prevents the 'Adapted Child' from forming a resentment-filled, fake faith.",
    "strengths": [
      "Validation of negative emotions as 'honest' and 'acceptable'.",
      "Use of Adult-level reality testing (looking at history and personal record).",
      "Avoidance of 'NIGYSOB' by not hunting for sins to explain the listener's suffering."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the hymn 'All the way my Savior leads me' could be perceived as a slight 'smothering' NP move that closes the tension too quickly.",
      "More 'Free Child' spontaneity could balance the heavy somberness of the text."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' and 'I' to maintain the Adult-Adult horizontal plane. Ensure that when offering 'signs of God' (Adult data), you remain open to the listener's Adult concluding that those signs are currently insufficient for them."
