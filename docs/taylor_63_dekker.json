They are the people who show up at places [...] We now own all that Christ has — all of his grace, all of his peace, all of his joy, all of his love, all of his power, all of his authority, as the Son of God, the Judge of all the earth."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "While the sermon cites John 17:22, it fails to identify what is unique to this specific verse. The preacher treats 'glory' as a general synonym for 'communion with God' or 'spiritual privilege,' which could be derived from many other passages in the Johannine corpus or the Epistles. The specific logic of the verse—the transfer of glory for the purpose of unity—is largely ignored in favor of a general discourse on beauty.",
      "quotes": [
        "The 'glory' refers here to the divine character shedding its brilliant glow far out toward all who will look upon it."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the specific 'haecceity' (this-ness) of John 17:22. Why does Jesus give glory specifically 'that they may be one'? Focus on the relationship between glory and ecclesial unity rather than general spiritual attractiveness."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of Greek or Hebrew study, nor a serious engagement with the historical-theological context of the High Priestly Prayer. The preacher uses the text as a springboard for cultural commentary rather than extracting the meaning intended for the first readers. The mention of the 'Holy of Holies' is a homiletical trope rather than an exegetical analysis of the passage's structure.",
      "quotes": [
        "In these chapters our heads are naturally bowed, our voices lowered, and our footsteps are quiet.",
        "If you want to be literal and pedestrian, of seventy-two thousand trained angelic warriors."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the 'holy atmosphere' and analyze the specific Johannine theology of 'doxa' (glory) and how it functions within the covenantal framework of John 17."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part of the sermon, specifically in its critique of the 'zeitgeist'. The preacher identifies concrete idols: the idle rich, power brokers, and the failures of minority leadership. However, the application eventually dissolves into general spiritual platitudes about 'walking in sunshine' and 'smiling though hell rages'.",
      "quotes": [
        "They are the people who show up at places where they can be seen to advantage, wearing the latest fashion creations of Gucci, Bill Blass, and Pierre Cardin.",
        "There are two thousand Web sites of bigotry on our computers..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The application must remain as concrete as the critique. Instead of general 'rejoicing', how does the 'glory' of Christ specifically transform the 'rivalries' and 'lust for public notice' mentioned earlier?"
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is bifurcated. The first half is a sociological critique of 'beauty' (application without text), and the second half is a devotional reflection on the text (exposition without concrete application). The 'present of revelation' where text and hearer converge is missing; the hearer is observed in the first half and lectured to in the second.",
      "quotes": [
        "To all of this our Lord Jesus would address a word...",
        "The people of Jesus were granted the beauty of his glory, so says the seventeenth chapter of John."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Integrate the critique of the 'beautiful people' directly into the unfolding of the text. Let the text itself 'expound' the hearer's insecurity from the start."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is well-articulated in terms of psychological anxiety and social failure. Redemption is present but tends toward the 'objective' and 'Christocentric' in a way Dekker warns against—it feels like a list of benefits rather than a movement of the soul. Gratitude is present in the final 'rejoice', but it is somewhat detached from the preceding misery.",
      "quotes": [
        "I see immaturity, childishness, anxiety, insecurity, self-centeredness...",
        "He sets us down at his table and bids us to feast until we want no more."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'misery' (the desperate battle against the wrinkle/sin) is specifically answered by the 'glory' of Christ, rather than just moving to a different topic."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon hints at the 'two ways' by contrasting the 'scape-graces' (lost in time) with those who 'dwell in God'. However, the seriousness of being lost is softened by a tone of 'pity' rather than the ultimate weight of life's design. The choice is presented more as a lifestyle improvement than a destination of the soul.",
      "quotes": [
        "Envy them? Pity them!",
        "A person can be lost in time and in eternity... These traditions will disappear from the church because they take neither man nor God seriously."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'ultimate possibilities' of the hearer's life design more sharply. The contrast between the 'idle rich' and the 'princes of the house regal' should be a matter of life and death, not just appearance."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon emphasizes that beauty is a gift/grace and not a human achievement. The doctrine of the two natures is implicit in the discussion of the 'man Christ Jesus' and his 'divine character'.",
      "quotes": [
        "While we can all make ourselves better people, we cannot make ourselves beautiful people.",
        "Christ gives to us his glory. He makes us joint heirs."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'glory' of Christ more specifically to his suffering (the Calvary-bound Savior) to avoid a triumphalist interpretation of 'beauty'."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 18.5 minutes (1850 words), the sermon falls just short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. This lack of 'breadth' results in a second half that feels rushed and repetitive in its imagery rather than deep in its theological exploration.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical middle section. Depth requires more than a list of where Jesus prayed; it requires a slower unfolding of the text's logic."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s ideal primarily because it lacks specific exegetical depth and fails to maintain the interwovenness of text and contemporary reality. It begins as a social commentary and ends as a devotional string of metaphors, missing the 'recreation' of the specific Bible passage into a 'new, current, proclamatory word'. The unique contribution of John 17:22 is sacrificed for a general discussion on spiritual beauty.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong, concrete critique of the 'zeitgeist' and modern idols (Gucci, power brokers, technology).",
      "Clear emphasis on grace over human perfectibility (Invictus critique).",
      "Maintains Christ as the telos of the message."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specific exegesis; the preacher does not show what this text says that no other text says.",
      "Bifurcated structure (separation of application and exposition).",
      "Duration is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for true homiletical depth.",
      "Over-reliance on general spiritual metaphors in the final third."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'speech about the gospel' and 'humanity' rather than a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense. It lacks the rigorous exposition of the specific pericope required to make the proclamation truly authoritative and unique."
