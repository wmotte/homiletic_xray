    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in sensory imagery, particularly in the opening movement. The preacher uses the 'mirror' as a central, tactile metaphor for human mortality. Following Paul Scott Wilson's 'show, don't tell', the text vividly describes the 'stench' of physical decay—gray hair, wrinkles, and the loss of privacy in a hospital. The imagery of the 'comb test' is culturally specific and visually arresting, grounding abstract concepts of beauty in the physical reality of hair and skin. It avoids 'dead metaphors' by revitalizing the biblical image of the moth-eaten garment. The language forces the hearer to 'see' the fading of youth before 'seeing' the radiance of God.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is dignified and precise, reflecting Marilyn Chandler McEntyre's 'stewardship of language'. The preacher avoids modern slang, opting for a 'sober beauty' that fits the Reformed/Baptist tradition. There is a clear effort to define terms like 'beauty' (attractiveness and delightfulness) while acknowledging the limits of language ('I cannot pretend to be able to define...'). The use of 'Canaanite language' (Mount Pisgah, Gethsemane) is present but serves a liturgical purpose rather than obscuring meaning. The vocabulary is rich, utilizing words like 'inculcate', 'complacently', and 'august'.",
      "quotes": [
        "beauty, meaning attractiveness and delightfulness, can be snatched away so quickly.",
        "When people do less than their best, and do that less at once badly and complacently...",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a rhythmic cadence characteristic of the 'Grand Style'. There is a clear use of parallelism and 'staccato' vs 'legato' phrasing. The list of biblical figures (Abraham, Moses, Hannah, Elisha) creates a cumulative, rhythmic momentum that Immink would describe as a 'happening' in time. The preacher uses alliteration ('high and holy', 'sighs and sobs') and repetition to build emotional weight. The text is clearly written for the ear, with a natural 'flow' that suggests a musical performance.",
      "quotes": [
        "our teeth seem so unchangeably strong, our step so unalterably firm, our eyesight so permanently clear...",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The sermon demonstrates a high degree of micro-aesthetic mastery. It utilizes vivid, sensory imagery (the mirror, the comb) to ground theological truths. The language is precise and elevated, avoiding clichés through fresh metaphors. Its greatest strength lies in its musicality; the preacher understands the oral nature of the medium, using rhythm and parallelism to guide the hearer's attention. While it occasionally drifts into more conventional religious language toward the end, the initial 'poetic' engagement with mortality is exceptionally strong."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'Lowry Loop' to some extent, beginning with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' (the cruelty of mirrors). It moves from the 'trouble' (physical decay) to the 'grace' (the beauty of the Lord). However, the structure is somewhat static in the middle. After the strong opening, it settles into a thematic exploration of 'Purpose' and 'Prayer' which feels more like a traditional 'three-point' structure than a dynamic journey. The 'turning point' is the introduction of the text (Psalm 90), but the tension dissipates slightly as it moves into moral exhortation regarding 'excellence' and 'sloppy performance'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Mirrors are wonderful things, but sometimes they are cruel.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The section on 'excellence' and George Bernard Shaw feels like a detour from the main arc.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher successfully 'reframes' the contemporary obsession with physical beauty through the lens of Psalm 90 and Psalm 39. The integration of the 'hospital reporter' and the 'fishing camp' story provides a bridge between the ancient text and modern experience. Cilliers' concept of 'reframing' is evident: the mirror is no longer just a tool for vanity but a 'thermometer' of mortality. The sermon respects the 'strangeness' of the biblical text while making it relevant to the congregation's specific cultural context (racial identity and the 'hair test').",
      "quotes": [
        "I speak of the way we look, for here is a gauge, a thermometer, of what is going on inside of us.",
        "The Bible continues to look on us when the first uncertainty as to our permanence and strength brushes up against us...",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'purpose' section feels less integrated with the specific text of Psalm 90:17.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is aesthetically rich, it leans toward a 'closed' structure. The preacher provides clear answers and moral imperatives ('we must strive to be perfect', 'whatever is worth doing... is worth doing well'). Following Ciska Stark's 'open work of art', there is limited room for the hearer's ambivalence or resistance. The mystery of 'the beauty of the Lord' is partially explained away as 'purpose' and 'excellence'. The conclusion is a triumphant 'happy ending' through prayer, which—while encouraging—leaves little space for the 'not yet' or the silence of God.",
      "quotes": [
        "I cannot pretend to be able to define... I believe that I know something of what it means...",
        "Our purpose needs to be to build high standards in our children...",

      "strengths": [
        "Initial acknowledgement of the 'dazed' feeling of loss allows for some human ambivalence.",
        "The preacher admits the difficulty of defining the 'beauty of the Lord'.",
        "The use of poetry at the end invites a different kind of 'seeing'."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The moralizing tone in the 'excellence' section closes the 'space for grace'.",
        "The conclusion is very prescriptive about the results of prayer.",
        "Could leave more room for the 'unanswered' prayers to avoid a 'kitsch' resolution."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent; the preacher acts as the authoritative witness/teacher."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is competent but traditional. It begins with a powerful, existential narrative arc that successfully 'reframes' human mortality. However, as the sermon progresses, it shifts from an 'open work' into a more 'closed', didactic structure. The integration of text and context is a major strength, particularly in the use of cultural anecdotes. The dramaturgy loses some momentum in the middle due to moralizing detours, but regains a liturgical 'flow' in the final litany of prayer, albeit with a very traditional and 'closed' resolution."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids religious kitsch by taking the 'pain of suffering' and the 'indignity' of the hospital seriously. It does not offer a 'cheap' beauty; it acknowledges the 'cruel' mirror and the 'moth-eaten' nature of life. However, it flirts with kitsch in the final section on prayer, where 'prayer changes conditions' is presented with a series of 'happy endings' (the singer, the young man). The transition to 'Mount Pisgah' and 'sweet hour of prayer' at the end risks becoming sentimental, but the overall 'sober beauty' of the first two-thirds maintains aesthetic depth.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'happy ending' anecdotes of the singer and the young man feel slightly pre-chewed.",
      "The use of 'sweet hour of prayer' as a final emotional flourish."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'indignity' of the hospital and semi-public bodily functions.",
      "The honest admission that the preacher cannot fully define 'the beauty of the Lord'."

    "recommendation": "To increase depth, the preacher could acknowledge the 'unanswered' prayer or the beauty that remains even when 'conditions' do not change."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is opened in the first half through the recognition of human helplessness ('we are helpless creatures'). This creates a 'space for grace' by stripping away self-sufficiency. However, the space is somewhat 'closed' in the second half by a heavy emphasis on 'purpose', 'excellence', and 'striving for perfection'. The gospel risks becoming a 'task' (moralization) rather than a 'gift'. The 'beauty of the Lord' is linked to 'sloppy performance', which shifts the focus from God's unavailable grace to human effort.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained well in the first half but resolved somewhat cheaply through 'excellence' in the second.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of God's beauty is introduced but then quickly categorized into 'purpose' and 'prayer'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Moralization prevails in the middle section; grace returns in the final liturgical movement.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'beauty of the Lord' to remain a gift that rests upon us even in our 'sloppy' or broken moments, not just in our 'excellence'."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of the 'Aesthetic Turn' within a traditional homiletical framework. Its primary strength lies in its 'Poetics of Language'—specifically its imagery and musicality. The preacher uses the 'mirror' and the 'hair test' as powerful aesthetic 'reframing' devices that move the congregation from a superficial view of reality to a deeper, theological perception. The language is 'stewarded' with care, and the rhythmic flow suggests a high level of performative awareness. However, the 'Dramaturgy of Structure' is less consistent. While the opening is narratively driven and 'open', the middle section becomes didactic and moralistic, which threatens to close the 'space for grace' that was so effectively opened. The sermon successfully avoids 'kitsch' by grounding its claims in the harsh realities of aging and illness, though the conclusion leans toward a more sentimental, traditional resolution. Overall, it is an aesthetically 'good' to 'strong' sermon that excels in sensory communication but remains somewhat bound by a closed, didactic structure.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Vivid, sensory imagery (the mirror, the hospital, the comb).",
      "Rhythmic, musical cadence and effective use of parallelism.",
      "Successful 'reframing' of cultural identity and mortality through Scripture."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduction of moralistic 'excellence' rhetoric that obscures grace.",
      "Greater dramaturgical 'openness' in the conclusion.",
      "Better integration of the 'purpose' section with the central 'beauty' metaphor."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Poetic-Imagistic with a Narrative-Dramatic opening.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson and the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers, while maintaining the 'Witness' stance of Thomas Long.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who appreciate 'sober beauty', classical rhetoric, and a connection between faith and the physical realities of life.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer in the mystery of God's beauty.",
      "Use more 'showing' in the application sections to match the quality of the introduction.",
      "Balance the 'call to excellence' with a stronger emphasis on the 'unmerited' nature of grace."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically sophisticated work that demonstrates how language and form can serve as a 'space for grace'. By taking the human condition seriously through vivid imagery, it earns the right to speak of divine beauty. While it occasionally retreats into the safety of moralism and traditional 'closed' structures, its micro-aesthetic qualities (rhythm, metaphor, precision) make it a compelling example of the power of the spoken word in the Reformed/Baptist tradition."
