    "sermon_start_end": "Gemeente van onze Heer, Jezus Christus. Vandaag staat de tafel van de Heer in ons midden gereed. Een tafel die met de nodige ernst en vragen is omgeven. Een tafel waarover in de onderwijzing die we nog zullen horen, wordt gezegd dat we er door Christus zelf toe worden uitgenodigd. [...] Neem dan de uitnodiging aan, want het is voor u. Of u nou rein en heilig bent, of u nou heel gelovig bent of er altijd maar aan twijfelt, of u zonder zonde bent of zondaar. U hoeft zelf niets mee te brengen. U hoeft alleen maar te komen.",
    "notes": "The sermon is specifically designed as a communion sermon (Heilig Avondmaal), which heavily influences its liturgical and sacramental focus."

  "kolb_phases_analysis": {
    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with the immediate physical presence of the communion table, which serves as a concrete anchor. However, the 'experience' remains somewhat formal and liturgical rather than visceral. While it mentions a 'peasant wedding' and 'ordinary people,' it fails to paint a vivid, sensory picture of the Cana wedding or the modern experience of running out of resources. The emotional connection is sought through the invitation to the table, but the 'slices of life' are generic ('life with trouble, life with joy') rather than specific.",
      "quotes": [
        "Vandaag staat de tafel van de Heer in ons midden gereed.",

        "Increase sensory detail in the narrative of the wedding to help hearers 'feel' the embarrassment of the wine running out.",

      ],
      "homiletical_manifestations": "Manifests through the 'hook' of the prepared communion table and the identification of Jesus with common people."
    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher effectively pauses to ask 'why' and explores the problem of the wine running out from multiple perspectives. There is a notable cultural and symbolic analysis regarding the location (Galilee) and the characters (the Mother as a symbol). The preacher avoids premature solutions by first deconstructing the 'miracle' as a 'sign' (prototype) and reflecting on the tension between tradition and Jesus' sovereignty.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wat is daar nou de betekenis van? Wat is nou de bedoeling van Jezus?",

      "homiletical_manifestations": "Manifests through problem exploration, symbolic analysis of characters, and questioning the 'why' behind the text's details."
    },
    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a solid theological framework. It moves from the narrative to the 'big idea' of Jesus as the 'Prototype' and the 'Bridegroom.' The exegesis connects the Cana sign to the 'Hour' of the cross and the eschatological wedding feast. The transformation of purification water into wine is logically developed into a theological statement about the transition from law/boundaries to grace/inclusion.",
      "quotes": [
        "Daar wordt gezegd dat Kana het eerste teken is. Het prototype.",
        "Die grenzen die worden getransformeerd in vreugdedrank... van de reiniging wordt wijn."

        "Clear theological connection between the miracle at Cana and the crucifixion.",
        "Effective conceptualization of 'transformation' as a core theological theme."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The logic of the 'Mother as Synagogue' is intellectually stimulating but might be too abstract for some hearers without more grounding.",
        "The transition from 'water of purification' to 'blood and water from the side' could be more exegetically supported."

      "homiletical_manifestations": "Manifests through dogmatic deepening, Christological focus, and the formulation of the 'sign' concept."
    },
    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. The 'application' is almost entirely liturgical: 'come to the table.' While this is appropriate for a communion service, it lacks ethical or practical dimensions for daily life outside the church walls. The call to action is passive ('receive,' 'come') rather than active experimentation with the truth in the world. There are no concrete steps for how a hearer should live differently on Monday.",
      "quotes": [

        "U hoeft alleen maar te komen op de stem van Hem die roept."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_kolb_score": 5.8,
    "summary": "The sermon is a solid example of a sacramental-theological discourse. It succeeds in deepening the hearer's understanding of the biblical text by moving beyond a simple miracle story to a profound 'sign' of the Gospel. It falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase, as the application is almost exclusively confined to the liturgical act of taking communion. While this is contextually appropriate, it misses the opportunity to translate the 'theology of the open table' into concrete ethical actions for the congregation's daily life. The symbolic interpretation of the Mother of Jesus as the Synagogue is a strong intellectual contribution but risks alienating hearers who prefer more concrete, historical, or practical approaches. The sermon effectively addresses 'Assimilating' and 'Diverging' learners but leaves 'Converging' learners with little to do.",

      "Include a 'Reflective Observation' section that critiques specific modern cultural 'boundaries' that need to be transformed."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a well-crafted theological reflection suitable for a liturgical setting. It demonstrates high competence in exegesis and dogmatic synthesis. However, from a Kolb perspective, it is 'top-heavy,' favoring reflection and conceptualization over concrete experience and practical action. To move from a 6 to an 8, the preacher needs to bridge the gap between the 'symbolic world' of the text and the 'practical world' of the hearer, ensuring that the 'new wine' of the Gospel is not just a theological concept but a lived reality."
