    "sermon_start_end": "Easter is too marvelous for words, but we’re going to have to take a crack at it. Luke, chapter 24, is one of the four accounts of the resurrection in the four gospels in the New Testament, and Luke 24 covers the entire day. [...] This is the hope your heart needs and wants, and the hope will not disappoint you, because Jesus Christ is risen indeed. Hallelujah! Let us pray."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon stays close to the narrative of Luke 24, particularly the physical details of the fish and the opening of the mind. However, it often drifts into general apologetics about the resurrection rather than mining what is unique to this specific Lukan text compared to other resurrection accounts.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus said, 'Do you have anything here to eat?' They gave him a piece of broiled fish, and he took it and ate it in their presence.",
        "The last part of the chapter, the part you just had read to you, talks about what happened that evening when Jesus appeared to his disciples"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more on the specific Lukan emphasis of 'staying in the city' and being 'clothed with power'—elements unique to this passage—rather than general resurrection defense."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates theological knowledge of the Old Testament (Deuteronomy, Isaiah) but the specific historical-critical context of Luke's community or the Greek nuances of the text are absent. The exegesis serves the systematic point rather than the text's own historical voice.",
      "quotes": [
        "The book of Deuteronomy in the Old Testament says, 'Cursed is he who is hung on a tree.'",
        "The first half of Isaiah is about a strong, kingly Messiah, but the second half of Isaiah is about this suffering servant figure"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the original context of Luke-Acts, specifically the concept of 'witness' (martys) and the significance of Jerusalem as the starting point for the mission."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the 'zeitgeist'—specifically addressing modern skepticism and the desire for personal identity. The use of the Costco receipt and the Lake Erie cottage provides tangible, though perhaps slightly sentimental, touchpoints for the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "Kathy and I love to go to Costco in Queens on the East River... here’s the point. They want proof you’ve paid it all.",
        "Kathy knows probably the time in her life in which she was happiest was two weeks a year when she went with her family to a little cottage on the shores of Lake Erie."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond individual emotional consolation toward the 'collective' application Dekker mentions, such as the political or social implications of 'repentance for all nations'."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a 'three-point' structure which tends to separate the text from the life-world. However, the preacher successfully uses the text's details (the fish) to immediately challenge modern paradigms, creating some movement between then and now.",
      "quotes": [
        "What could that possibly symbolize? ... The answer is it doesn’t symbolize anything. It’s evidence.",
        "If Jesus was raised from the dead, your feelings about those parts of the Bible are not relevant."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the 'point-lesson' structure. Instead of 'Three things we can learn,' let the exposition of the text itself be the unfolding of the application."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Misery is defined here as the 'irretrievability of life' and the 'curse' of sin. Redemption is clearly located in Christ's substitutionary work. Gratitude is present as 'hope,' though it remains somewhat psychological rather than a call to service.",
      "quotes": [
        "The irretrievability of life is a kind of death in the midst of life, and as the years go by, it just crushes you.",
        "He must have been [cursed] for someone else’s sins."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by addressing the disciples' specific fear and 'troubled minds' as a rejection of God's Word, not just a general sadness about aging."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are present but softened. The preacher mentions that 'salvation comes through him' and that 'feelings are not relevant,' but the existential threat of being 'lost' is framed more as missing out on hope than as a serious judgment.",
      "quotes": [
        "If Jesus Christ is the resurrected Son of God, then salvation comes through him.",
        "I don’t think you are in touch with your own heart. This is the hope your heart needs and wants."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the necessity of 'repentance' mentioned in verse 47 more sharply as the turning point between the two ways."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "Strongly Christocentric. Christ is the telos and the 'receipt' of grace. The sermon correctly identifies that the resurrection is the vindication of the crucified Messiah and the only source of life outside the self.",
      "quotes": [
        "The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the key to understand the message of the entire Bible.",
        "The resurrection is a gigantic receipt, that there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'power from on high' (v. 49) is linked to Christ's ongoing rule, not just a past historical event."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "With an estimated duration of over 24 minutes, the sermon meets Dekker's requirement for breadth. It allows space for narrative illustrations and theological reflection.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this length but increase the density of the 'exposition' phase to provide more 'depth' alongside the 'breadth'."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a clear, Christocentric address that takes the historicity of the resurrection seriously. It falls short in its formal exegesis, lacking engagement with the original languages and the specific Lukan context. It leans heavily on psychological application and apologetics rather than the specific 'new, current word' of this particular pericope. The 'two ways' are present but lack the sharp edge Dekker envisions.",
    "strengths": [
      "Adequate length allowing for theological development.",
      "Strong focus on Christ as the center of all Scripture.",
      "Concrete contemporary illustrations that engage the zeitgeist."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specific exegetical depth regarding the Greek text or Lukan theology.",
      "The 'two ways' are presented more as a choice for 'hope' versus 'sadness' rather than a life-and-death spiritual reality.",
      "The structure is somewhat generic, treating the text as a source for 'lessons' rather than an unfolding revelation."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate sermon that functions as a form of the Word of God by pointing to Christ. However, it requires more rigorous exposition of the specific Bible passage to meet Dekker's ideal of a 'bicycle mechanic' who has perfectly mounted the wheel."
