    "summary": "This sermon is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, providing historical and theological data to help the listener process their current reality. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent (shaming the listener for being busy or 'consumerist') and instead uses the Free Child's sense of wonder to paint a picture of hope. By admitting his own 'cheating' of the lectionary, the preacher establishes a transparent, non-hierarchical relationship with the audience.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'I' and 'We' voice to maintain the Adult-Adult connection. The explicit permission given to the congregation to be in a 'frenzy' is a powerful way to decontaminate the Critical Parent/Adapted Child dynamic."
