While it purports to offer the security of God's love, it creates a 'double bind' where intellectual honesty (Adult) is framed as a spiritual betrayal (Child). The preacher's own admitted 'serious doubts' are used not to build Adult-Adult empathy, but to reinforce the necessity of a Parent-Child leap of faith.",
