    "estimated_word_length": 1450,
    "estimated_duration_minutes": 14,
    "sermon_start_end": "In 1 Corinthians 6:18, the blessed Apostle Paul writes: “All other sins a person commits are outside his body; but when he commits fornication, he sins in his own body.” [...] as soon as he’s free from the vice of fornication in the broad sense, his sins will be outside the body, for (as I’ve said several times) he himself will somehow be outside the body—a stranger to it."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon focuses intensely on a specific, difficult phrase in 1 Corinthians 6:18. It seeks the 'unique' point of the text—the distinction between 'in' and 'outside' the body—which is indeed found nowhere else in Scripture in this specific phrasing.",
      "quotes": [
        "What, then, does he mean by 'Any other sin is outside the sinner’s body, but sexual immorality is in his body'?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "While the focus is sharp, it occasionally drifts into a thematic treatment of 'fornication' in a general sense in section 3, losing the specific grip on the Corinthian context."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The exegesis is limited to logical deduction and cross-referencing within the canon. There is no explicit engagement with the Greek (porneia) or the specific cultural context of Corinthian temple prostitution, which would have sharpened the 'original meaning'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Other translations of the same Pauline text indicate that such sins constitute a desecration..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the specific historical-religious context of Corinth to explain why Paul emphasizes the 'body' as a temple so vehemently."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is largely psychological and philosophical rather than concrete. It describes the 'state' of the soul but fails to address contemporary manifestations of this 'enslavement' in modern society (e.g., digital consumption, modern relationships).",
      "quotes": [
        "...the heart actually and absolutely becomes the body’s slave.",
        "loving God is incompatible with loving the world"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the abstract 'world' and 'flesh' to name specific contemporary idols and situations where this bodily enslavement occurs."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon avoids the 'block' structure. It attempts to explain the text by describing the human condition simultaneously. However, the 'application' remains more of a psychological explanation than a call to action or a current word.",
      "quotes": [
        "the force, the fierceness of passion fuse soul and body into one; and the soul, glued and chained, clings to this evil"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'now' of the hearer is as prominent as the 'then' of the text during the explanation."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The theme of 'misery' (enslavement to the senses) is very strong. 'Redemption' is present through the 'bought at a price' motif. 'Gratitude' is the background for the call to use the body for God's glory.",
      "quotes": [
        "Submerged, engulfed in this shameful, seething mire, his soul becomes a mere slave.",
        "You don’t belong to yourself, for you’ve been bought at a great price."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The 'redemption' aspect remains somewhat objective; it could be more personally applied to the 'slave' described in section 2."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon explicitly mentions the exclusion from the Kingdom of God and the 'destruction' of those who stray. It takes the hearer seriously as a responsible being.",
      "quotes": [
        "none of those will inherit the kingdom of God.",
        "Those who stray from you will perish; you will destroy those who abandon you"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The 'temporal loss' (being lost in time) could be more sharply defined—how does this sin destroy a life *now*?"
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the one who bought the body and as the 'telos' of the members, but the sermon leans heavily toward a psychological analysis of sin rather than the liberating presence of Christ.",
      "quotes": [
        "Shall I, then, take Christ’s members and make them members of some whore?",
        "Christ’s adorable blood"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make Christ more than a 'price paid' or a 'member' we possess; show Him as the active subject who breaks the 'chains' described."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1450 words, the sermon likely lasts 14-15 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for true depth.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the contemporary application and the specific exegesis of the 'temple' imagery to reach the 20-minute threshold."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a rigorous intellectual exercise that succeeds in identifying a unique scriptural problem but falls short in contemporary concreteness and required length. It excels in describing the 'misery' of carnal enslavement but remains too abstract in its 'application' to the modern zeitgeist.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong focus on the 'unique' point of the specific Bible passage (Thesis 1).",
      "Vivid, non-sentimental description of human misery and the psychology of sin (Thesis 5).",
      "Clear acknowledgement of the seriousness of spiritual choices and the possibility of being lost (Thesis 6)."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Duration is significantly below the 20-minute minimum required for 'depth' (Thesis 8).",
      "Application is too general ('the world') and lacks the 'humanities'/sociological edge Dekker demands (Thesis 3).",
      "Exegesis lacks engagement with original languages and historical context (Thesis 2)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a substantively serious address, but it is not yet a 'sermon' in the full sense of Dekker’s definition due to its brevity and lack of concrete, contemporary application. It functions more as a theological meditation than a current, proclamatory word."
