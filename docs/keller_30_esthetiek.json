    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon uses imagery primarily as a pedagogical tool rather than a poetic immersion. While it references vivid biblical scenes (stripping of the robe, target practice with arrows), the language remains largely conceptual. The preacher utilizes external cultural references, such as the 'Bride of Frankenstein' or 'Gristedes store', to create mental hooks for the audience. These function as 'windows' into the argument but lack the 'sober beauty' of high-poetic Reformed homiletics. The imagery is effective for clarity but occasionally borders on the functional rather than the evocative. It follows Wilson's 'show, don't tell' intermittently, often reverting to 'telling' the theological meaning of the image too quickly.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jonathan stripped himself of the robe... that was essentially the same thing as giving David his crown.",
        "The monster is rather lonely, too. Everybody is trying to kill him... lurching off into the woods saying, 'Friend, friend.'",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and exhibits high 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre). The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by defining terms like 'covenant' through the lens of modern 'user relationships' and 'cost-benefit calculators'. There is a deliberate effort to distinguish between 'sentiment' and 'friendship'. The vocabulary is accessible yet intellectually rigorous, doing justice to the complexity of human psychology (envy, vulnerability, calculation) without becoming academic. Every word serves the purpose of clarity and 'reframing' the hearer's understanding of their own social reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "A user relationship always has a cost-benefit little calculator connected to it.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a clear oral cadence, characterized by a 'staccato' rhythm typical of conversational teaching. It is 'talked' rather than 'read', which Immink would identify as a strength for 'event' preaching. However, it lacks the 'legato' of poetic prose. The rhythm is driven by logic and rhetorical questions rather than phonetic beauty or parallelism. It is 'paper language' in its structured points but 'oral' in its delivery style. The musicality is functional—designed to keep the hearer's attention on the argument rather than to evoke a sense of the 'holy' through sound.",
      "quotes": [
        "Friends always let you in and never let you down.",
        "You’ll never get through your hardest times without friends, and you’ll never get through life without adversity.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 6.67,
    "summary_language": "The language is a model of clarity and precision, successfully 'reframing' ancient biblical concepts for a modern urban audience. While it lacks the high-poetic density of classical Reformed aesthetics, it excels in 'stewardship of the word' by avoiding jargon and providing sharp, analytical definitions. The imagery is functional and illustrative, serving the 'plot' of the argument. The musicality is that of a skilled teacher—clear, rhythmic, and engaging—though it rarely rises to the level of the truly poetic or transcendent."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by upsetting the equilibrium—challenging the modern assumption that we have 'friends' when we might only have 'users'. It moves through the 'trouble' of human loneliness and the 'adversity' of David’s life, leading to the 'turning point' in the character of Jonathan, and finally to the 'resolution' in the friendship of Christ. The structure is a hybrid: it uses a 'three-point' outline but infuses it with a narrative movement from the Garden of Eden to the Cross. The energy is sustained through the 'Frankenstein' illustration and the psychological 'reveal' of the hearer's own relational calculations.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jonathan’s friendship with David brackets the evil.",
        "Now we know we’re really into transparency... when we’re willing to wound each other.",

        "The transition between the three main points feels a bit 'homiletic-by-numbers'; could be more organic.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. Cilliers' concept of 'reframing' is perfectly executed. The preacher takes the 'strangeness' of Jonathan stripping his robe and reframes it as a critique of modern 'user' networking in NYC. The synthesis between the 1 Samuel text and the contemporary experience of 'networking' feels both surprising and inevitable. The text is not a 'springboard' but the 'lens' through which the hearer's life is examined. The use of Genesis 2 to explain loneliness as a 'divine' trait rather than a 'sinful' one is a masterful piece of theological reframing.",
      "quotes": [
        "We network here... hanging out with people we think are helpful to us.",
        "To be lonely is not to be imperfect; it’s to be like God, because he was built... in the image of God.",
        "David was saved through Jonathan’s sacrificial friendship, and you can only be saved through Jesus’ sacrificial friendship."

      "strengths": [
        "Profound 'reframing' of loneliness as a reflection of the Trinity.",
        "Sharp critique of urban 'user' culture using the biblical 'covenant'.",

        "Include more 'resistance' from the text—parts of the story that don't fit the 'friendship' theme so neatly."

      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing. It changes how the hearer perceives both their loneliness and their social 'networking'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Aesthetically, the sermon leans toward being a 'closed work of art' (Stark). While it raises profound questions about the hearer's life, it provides very specific, 'neat' theological answers. The 'mystery' of the Trinity and the 'problem' of loneliness are 'solved' by the friendship of Jesus. There is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or for the hearer to remain in the 'wilderness of Ziph'. The ending is prescriptive and declarative rather than invitational or open-ended. It functions as a 'teaching' that settles the mind rather than a 'poem' that haunts the soul.",
      "quotes": [
        "The answer is yeah, but the only spouses... who get you through... are ones who are also friends.",
        "You’ll never become all you ought to be without friends.",
        "Well, are you looking for that friend? Here he is."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Provides a clear, comforting 'Space for Grace' through the person of Christ.",
        "The logic is 'sealed' so tightly that it offers a sense of intellectual and spiritual security.",
        "The 'openness' of the Frankenstein monster's cry ('Friend, friend') is a rare moment of haunting ambiguity."

      "improvement_points": [
        "End with an image or a question rather than a declarative 'Here he is'.",
        "Allow more room for the 'unresolved' nature of many friendships that fail despite 'constancy'.",
        "Avoid 'neat' theological formulas that explain away the 'ache' of loneliness too quickly."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Closed/Monovalent. The sermon acts as a 'map' with a clear destination rather than an 'open work' for exploration."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-structure is highly effective in its 'reframing' of the human condition, moving the hearer from a critique of modern relationships to the grace of the Gospel. It follows a narrative arc that sustains interest through psychological insight and cultural commentary. However, it suffers from a 'closed' aesthetic; the theological resolutions are perhaps too tidy, leaving little room for the hearer's own struggle with the 'not yet' of friendship. It is a powerful 'witness' (Long) but functions more as a 'demonstration' than an 'event' of mystery."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids 'religious kitsch' by grounding its comfort in the 'adversity' and 'sacrifice' of the text. It acknowledges the 'stench' of loneliness and the 'murderous' intent of Saul. However, the use of 'The Bride of Frankenstein' is a risky move—the preacher himself admits it is 'kitschy'. While he uses it to point to a deeper truth, the 'happy ending' of the theological argument (Jesus as the perfect friend) can feel slightly 'pre-chewed' if the hearer is currently in deep relational trauma. The 'anti-kitsch' strength lies in the 'wounds of a friend' section, which takes the 'pain' of growth seriously.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'Bride of Frankenstein' illustration, while self-aware, flirts with sentimentalism.",
      "The 'happy' resolution of Adam's loneliness in the Garden can feel like a 'clichéd story' if not handled carefully."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The analysis of 'user relationships' and the 'cost-benefit calculator' feels authentic to the urban experience.",
      "The description of Jesus' arms being 'nailed open' as the ultimate vulnerability."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To increase depth, spend more time in the 'wilderness of Ziph'—the space where the friend is gone and the enemy is still hunting. Avoid resolving the 'monster's' cry too quickly with a theological 'answer'."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'reframing' of the human condition. By defining loneliness as an 'image of God' trait rather than a failure, the preacher creates a 'Space for Grace' that removes shame. The 'vertical dimension' (Cilliers) is present in the move to the Cross. However, the space is somewhat 'crowded' by the dense logical structure. Grace is presented as the 'logical conclusion' of the argument, which can sometimes feel less like a 'gift' and more like a 'result'. The 'mystery' of God is respected in the Trinitarian section, but 'explained' in the friendship section.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained well in the middle (the 'wounds' of a friend), but resolved perhaps too 'cheaply' at the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the Trinity is introduced but then used as a functional 'explanation' for human psychology.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. Even the 'exhortation' to be a friend is grounded in 'receiving' the friendship of Jesus first.",
    "recommendation": "Allow for more 'silence' in the text—places where the 'mystery' of why some friendships fail despite our 'constancy' is allowed to remain."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of the 'New Homiletic' applied within a Reformed, Christocentric framework. Its primary aesthetic power lies in its 'reframing'—the ability to take a familiar biblical narrative and make it a sharp, diagnostic lens for the hearer's contemporary life. The language is precise, 'stewardship-oriented', and free of alienating jargon. Structurally, it moves with a clear narrative arc from human 'adversity' to divine 'constancy'. Its aesthetic limitations lie in its 'closedness'; the sermon is so logically and theologically 'sealed' that it leaves little room for the hearer's own interpretive 'appropriation' or for the 'ambivalence' of the human experience. It is a 'teaching-performance' that excels in clarity and 'reframing' but stops short of the 'open work of art' that invites the hearer into the 'holy mystery' without immediate resolution.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of loneliness through a Trinitarian lens.",
      "Exceptional 'stewardship of language' in translating 'covenant' for a secular/urban context.",
      "Strong narrative arc that maintains tension between 'user' and 'friend'."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase 'openness' by allowing the conclusion to be more invitational and less declarative.",
      "Deepen 'imagery' by grounding the biblical narrative in more sensory, 'showing' language.",
      "Balance the 'analytical' rhythm with more 'poetic-contemplative' passages."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Analytical-Reframing (A combination of 'New Homiletic' structure and 'Apologetic' precision).",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Witness' model of Thomas Long, with the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson.",
    "audience_analysis": "Urban, intellectually-minded hearers who are skeptical of 'religious' language but hungry for psychological and relational depth.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending'—a question or a lingering image.",
      "Incorporate a 'lament' section to deepen the 'anti-kitsch' quality.",
      "Use more 'sensory' metaphors that appeal to smell, touch, or sound."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically 'good to strong' (6.8) work. It achieves its purpose of 'reframing' reality through the Gospel with surgical precision. While it lacks the 'sober beauty' of a more poetic Reformed tradition, it offers a 'sober clarity' that is itself an aesthetic contribution to modern homiletics. It opens 'Space for Grace' by dignifying human longing, though it could improve by leaving more 'room' for the Holy Spirit to work in the 'unresolved' spaces of the hearer's life."
