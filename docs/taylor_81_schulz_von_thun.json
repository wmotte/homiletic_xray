  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides solid exegetical groundwork, particularly regarding the social and legal status of lepers in the Levitical tradition. The distinction between the 'holy people' and the 'unclean' is well-articulated, providing a clear 'Sache' for the congregation to grasp. However, the theological depth regarding the 'Living Christ' (Barth) is somewhat flattened by a transition into general observations about miracles in nature and technology. While the exegesis of Luke's 'Gospel for the outsider' is accurate, the sermon occasionally drifts from the specific Christological event into a broader phenomenology of gratitude. The 'blue' side is clear but lacks the sharp dogmatic edge that would elevate it beyond a moral lesson on thankfulness.",
      "quotes": [
        "Samaritans and Jews had nothing to do with each other...",
        "The law of Leviticus 13:45 provided that a leper should tear his clothes...",
        "Biblical leprosy included several skin diseases variously identified as contagious ringworm and psoriasis."

        "Deepen the connection between the physical healing and the 'wholeness' (soteriology) mentioned at the end.",
        "Avoid the detour into 'miracles of the human body' which dilutes the specific revelatory act."

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The preacher uses accessible analogies (measles signs, car engines) to explain complex social and biological realities."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a personality that values order, tradition, and a certain nostalgic morality. There is a conscious 'Selbstdarstellung' of the wise observer who has 'known men who couldn't laugh.' However, the green side is largely controlled; the preacher does not 'leak' much personal vulnerability or current struggle. The 'I' is used primarily as a rhetorical tool to anchor the message in experience rather than as a transparent vessel of faith. The tone is grave and solemn, matching the Lenten theme, but it feels more like a professional mantle than an involuntary self-revelation.",
      "quotes": [
        "I once knew a man who appeared to lack the ability to laugh.",
        "When I was a lad, it was the law in our place...",
        "Do I speak to someone who pleaded with the Lord..."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive (Zwanghaft). The preacher emphasizes law, correctness, 'playing fair with God,' and historical continuity. There is a strong desire for structural gratitude and a clear 'record of giving.'",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is subservient to the pedagogical goal, but occasionally stands in the way by framing the relationship with God as a matter of 'playing fair' (transactional).",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined by a 'teaching' authority that borders on paternalistic. The preacher uses the 'we' to include the congregation in sin ('all of us need mercy'), but quickly shifts to a 'you' that feels accusatory or investigative ('Where are the nine?', 'Some of you...'). There is a significant amount of 'relationship noise' created by the pressure to perform gratitude. The preacher positions himself as the one auditing the congregation's 'blank spaces' in their record of giving, which creates a vertical distance rather than a solidary 'eye-level' relationship.",
      "quotes": [
        "See the blank spaces. Behold the pittances for the Kingdom.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The appeal is the dominant side of this sermon. The 'red' force is directed toward behavioral change: the listener must stop being one of the 'nine' and start being the 'one'. While the sermon ends with a Christological doxology, the bulk of the message functions as 'Anspruch' (Demand). The theological 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is present but is often used as a lever to increase the weight of the demand—if God has done so much, why are you so ungrateful? This risks turning the Gospel into a new Law of Gratitude, where faith is measured by the 'loudness' of the return.",
      "quotes": [
        "It would be a greater miracle if each of us decided to play fair with God.",

      "risk_of_moralism": "High. The sermon risks making the listener feel that the healing is only 'whole' if the human response is sufficient.",
      "strengths": [
        "Clear, actionable call to praise.",
        "Strong concluding focus on Christ as the ultimate gift."

    "dominant_side": "Red (Appeal)",
    "disruptions": "The transition from the 'miracle of the lepers' to 'the miracle of the church furnishings' creates a communicative disruption where the 'Sache' (Christ) is replaced by institutional maintenance.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 5.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a classic example of a 'Law-heavy' appeal framed within a Lenten context. While it begins with a sharp exegetical focus on the plight of the lepers, it quickly pivots into a moral exhortation. The psychological 'red side' (Appeal) dominates, using the 'sadness' of Jesus to elicit guilt in the listener for their perceived ingratitude. From a Barthian perspective, the sermon suffers from an 'unhealthy psychologization' where God’s grace is treated as a commodity that requires a 'fair' return. The preacher’s Riemann-type (Compulsive) manifests in a focus on 'blank spaces' and 'records of giving,' which may distract the listener from the 'Living Christ' and redirect them toward institutional anxiety. However, the final doxology provides a necessary, albeit late, shift back to the 'Zuspruch' of Christ’s work.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon risks making God a 'partner in a contract' rather than the Sovereign Subject of Grace. The phrase 'play fair with God' is theologically problematic.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Vivid historical imagery of the leper's condition.",
      "Strong rhetorical structure following the 'Kind Answer' and 'Sad Question'.",
      "Powerful concluding Christological litany."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Shift the focus from the 'nine's failure' to the 'One's sufficiency'.",
      "Reduce transactional language regarding stewardship.",
      "Bridge the gap between the 'miracle of biology' and the 'miracle of the Kingdom' more carefully."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A rhetorically competent but theologically legalistic sermon that prioritizes the human response over the divine gift."
