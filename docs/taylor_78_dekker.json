  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Luke 18:1 as a springboard for a topical discourse on prayer and perseverance. It fails Dekker's requirement to find what is in THIS passage that is nowhere else. The parable of the Unjust Judge (the actual content of Luke 18:1-8) is entirely ignored in favor of a general theology of Jesus' prayer life.",
      "quotes": [
        "And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint. (Luke 18:1)"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must engage with the specific imagery of the widow and the unjust judge. A sermon on Luke 18:1 that omits the parable it introduces is not an exposition of the text but a speech on a biblical keyword."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of Greek/Hebrew study or historical-critical engagement. The preacher does not address the Lukan context or the specific eschatological tension of the 'delayed' answer to prayer inherent in the passage.",
      "quotes": [
        "What is he Saying to us? He is saying, is he not, that praying and fainting cannot live under the same roof"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the historical context of the first readers—likely a community facing persecution or the 'delay of the parousia'—to explain why 'fainting' was a specific threat to them."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is the sermon's strongest point, specifically regarding the 'zeitgeist' of the black experience in America and the collapse of the family. However, it often veers into generalities about 'success' and 'failure'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The collapse of our black family in America has been attributed often and partly, I think, truthfully to that. Our menfolk, our males, facing the awful odds of this society just do not feel equal to carrying the load."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the 'Memorial Day weekend' anecdotes toward a more rigorous application of how the 'unjust judge' (the world's systems) relates to the contemporary hearer's struggle."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon is not an interwoven movement of text and hearer. It is a series of personal anecdotes followed by a topical list of Jesus' prayers elsewhere in the Gospels. The text (Luke 18:1) is a motto, not a partner in the dialogue.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus puts it to us clearly here in the beginning of the eighteenth chapter... What is he Saying to us?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Structure the sermon so that the details of the biblical narrative (the widow's persistence) provide the rhythm for the contemporary application."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon effectively addresses 'misery' (fainting, guilt, societal pressure) and 'redemption' (Christ's intercession). It avoids being overly objective by rooting the struggle in the human subject.",
      "quotes": [
        "Added to that is our own burden of guilt, the sins that drain our spiritual energy and leave us spent and exhausted."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'gratitude' aspect; the sermon ends on a note of 'rest' but lacks the ethical drive of gratitude (sanctification) that Dekker/Heidelberg Catechism implies."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on the 'peril of quitting' and being a 'castaway,' acknowledging the possibility of temporal and eternal loss. However, it lacks the 'sharpness' Dekker demands, leaning more toward encouragement than the gravity of the 'two ways'.",
      "quotes": [
        "I would think the greatest peril for Christian people is the peril of quitting along this way, fainting... lest... I myself might become a castaway."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the alternative to the 'narrow way' more concrete. What does it look like to be 'lost in time' for the modern hearer beyond just 'giving up'?"
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon moves from human effort to the intercession of the Great High Priest. It rightly identifies salvation as being outside the self.",
      "quotes": [
        "He ever liveth to make intercession for us... While I am praying and you are praying, he is praying for us, right there at God's right hand."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure Christ is presented as the 'telos' of the specific text (Luke 18) rather than importing a general High Priest theology from Hebrews to fill the void."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 19 minutes (1950 words), the sermon narrowly misses Dekker's 20-minute minimum. While it has 'breadth' in terms of anecdotes, it lacks the 'depth' of exegetical labor.",
      "improvement_point": "Increase the duration by incorporating rigorous exegetical exposition of the Greek text and its theological implications."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily due to a lack of specific biblical exposition. It treats the Bible passage as a theme rather than a unique revelation. While it succeeds in psychological depth and Christocentric focus, it fails to engage with the original context or the specificities of the Lukan parable.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong psychological awareness of the hearer's 'misery' and societal context.",
      "Clear Christocentric telos, pointing to salvation outside the human subject.",
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' (misery and redemption) as a background framework."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Total absence of specific exegesis of the parable following Luke 18:1.",
      "Over-reliance on personal anecdotes and 'lofty language' at the expense of textual depth.",
      "Application is often general ('pray on') rather than derived from the text's unique logic."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate religious speech, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense. It fails the formal definition of 'exposition and application of a specific Bible passage' because the passage itself is largely absent from the discourse."
