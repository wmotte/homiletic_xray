    "sermon_start_end": "Do you not find it strange that the world cannot get over Calvary and the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth? There were other events in the life of Jesus, the tense and mighty drama of temptation, the calling of the Twelve, the healing miracles, the Sermon on the Mount [...] There is something about that lonely, lightless hill called Calvary which delivers us."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Luke 23:33 as a springboard rather than a specific text to be 'recreated into a new word.' It fails Dekker's requirement to find what is in THIS text that is nowhere else. Instead, it treats 'Calvary' as a general biblical keyword or idea, which Dekker explicitly forbids.",
      "quotes": [
        "Each Gospel writer... gives the Calvary account with terse leanness. 'When they were come to the place called Calvary, there they crucified him.'",
        "Take another look at Calvary and you will see there the ugly, stubborn mystery of sin."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the unique narrative features of Luke's account specifically (e.g., the specific dialogue or the 'place called the Skull') rather than merging all four Gospels into a general 'Calvary' theme."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of Greek/Hebrew study or historical-critical engagement. The preacher does not address what the text meant for the first readers or the specific context of Israel. It relies on a devotional reading of the English text.",
      "quotes": [
        "You read all four of the accounts of the crucifixion as they appear in Matthew, in Mark, in Luke, in John..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Engage with the Lucan context of the 'innocent' sufferer and the specific theological nuances of the Greek text regarding the crucifixion site."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part, showing a 'broad knowledge of the humanities' and the zeitgeist. It critiques modern euphemisms for sin (the 'go-getter', the 'swinger') with the sharp, concrete language Dekker appreciates.",
      "quotes": [
        "A man all for himself we do not call a sinner. He is 'go-getter' and 'a sharp dealer,' we say with a tinge of admiration.",
        "Self-centeredness of class, section, race can destroy our land."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond moral categories of 'sin' into more specific contemporary 'lostness' as defined in Thesis 6."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured as a series of 'looks' at Calvary. While application and exposition are mixed, the 'exposition' is so thin that the hearer is drawn more into the preacher's reflections than into the text itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "Still another look at Calvary shows us the mystery of triumphant assurance."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Allow the specific details of the text to drive the application, rather than using the text as a hook for pre-conceived themes."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon follows the HC structure well. It deals seriously with 'misery' (sin as repulsive) and 'redemption' (Christ's sacrifice). It avoids being 'too objective' by making man the subject of the struggle.",
      "quotes": [
        "Sin, the kind of cheap compromising with principle which you and I practice, put the sword in his side.",
        "We need God's grace to cleanse us, to deliver us from presumptuousness."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'gratitude' part is more explicitly developed as a response to the specific grace found in the text."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon hints at the seriousness of being lost ('destroy our land', 'spoils all of life'), but it lacks the sharp 'two ways' distinction Dekker demands. The ultimate consequences of the 'broad way' are somewhat softened.",
      "quotes": [
        "There is something in us humans that is cruel and wicked... which needs to be plucked out before it spoils all of life."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Thematize the 'lostness' more clearly—either the temporal loss of society or the eternal loss of the individual—to force a decision."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon emphasizes the 'God-man' and the doctrine of the two natures (strong enough to be man), and points to salvation outside of self.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have a God who was strong enough to become a man like those whom he loved that they might become like him.",
        "We know something has been done for us that nobody but Jesus could do."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect Christ's divinity more directly to the specific action in the Luke passage rather than general systematic claims."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1,150 words, the sermon would last roughly 11-12 minutes. This fails Dekker’s absolute minimum of 20 minutes. It lacks the 'breadth' required for 'depth'.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical and theological 'exposition' to reach the 20-minute threshold; the current brevity prevents a full 'actualization' of the Word."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short primarily on formal grounds: it is significantly too short (approx. 12 minutes) and treats the Bible passage as a general theme rather than a specific, unique word. It lacks the necessary academic rigor in exegesis (Hebrew/Greek/Context). However, it succeeds in its psychological sharpness and its refusal to sentimentalize sin, aligning well with Dekker's view on the humanities and the 'three parts'.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application that unmasks the 'zeitgeist' and modern euphemisms for sin.",
      "Strong Christocentric focus that maintains the 'God-man' tension (Thesis 7).",
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' (misery, redemption, gratitude) as a background framework."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (Thesis 8) which precludes theological depth.",
      "Lack of specific exegesis; the sermon is a topical speech on 'Calvary' rather than an exposition of Luke 23:33 (Thesis 1 & 2).",
      "Absence of the 'two ways' urgency; the call to decision is present but lacks the 'ultimate' gravity Dekker requires."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "According to Dekker’s strict formal definition, this is not yet a full sermon. It is an effective 'speech about the gospel' or a 'biblical character/event,' but it lacks the specific exegetical rootedness and the 20-minute breadth required to be a 'recreation' of the Word of God."
