    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically complex. It avoids the 'Nurturing Parent' trap of making the congregation dependent on the preacher. Instead, it uses a 'Prophetic Adult' stance to force the listener to confront reality. However, the heavy use of 'Ain't It Awful' and systemic guilt can lead to a 'learned helplessness' in the listener (Adapted Child) rather than empowered action. The ending successfully pivots to a Free Child/Adult integration through the story of hope.",
    "strengths": [
      "High degree of intellectual honesty (Adult).",
      "Avoids the Rescuer trap by admitting personal 'breadlessness'.",
      "Strong use of Free Child imagery (The Baker, Biteable God)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Critical Parent' indictments are so broad they may trigger defensive 'Rebellious Child' reactions.",
      "The link between individual consumption and global systemic evil is presented as an ultimatum, which can paralyze the Adult ego."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward a score of 10, the preacher could offer more 'Adult-to-Adult' concrete steps for change, reducing the 'Psychological' weight of the 'Ain't It Awful' game and replacing it with 'Adult' problem-solving."
