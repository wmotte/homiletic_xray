    "psychological_health_score": 7,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically robust because it avoids the 'smothering' Nurturing Parent common in Easter sermons. It challenges the listener's Adult ego to face the 'terror' of the Resurrection. However, it flirts with 'NIGYSOB' and 'Ain't It Awful' by spending significant time critiquing the 'shallow' faith of others, which can create a 'Parent-Child' dynamic of intellectual superiority.",

      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement with the biblical text.",

      "High Critical Parent energy when discussing greeting cards and other clergy.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Reduce the 'Ain't It Awful' critique of the culture. Instead of starting with what Easter 'isn't' (Parental correction), start with the Adult observation of the text's 'strangeness' to keep the transaction Adult-Adult from the beginning."
