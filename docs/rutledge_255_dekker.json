  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's first thesis by using a comparative 'quiz' format between multiple texts (Ecclesiastes vs. Revelation) rather than recreating one specific passage into a current word. It treats the Bible as a source of 'ideas' about the human condition rather than submitting to the unique voice of a single pericope.",
      "quotes": [
        "I’m going to read two short passages, and you figure out which one is in the Bible.",
        "The canonical Biblical view of the human condition is that if we were left to ourselves..."

      "improvement_point": "Select either Ecclesiastes 9 or Revelation 7 as the sole foundation. Avoid using one text merely as a foil for another; find what is unique to the chosen text that exists nowhere else."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is a basic awareness of the canonical status and literary genre (poetry/liturgy), but the exegesis is thin. The preacher relies on general thematic summaries rather than deep linguistic or historical exposition of the specific texts.",
      "quotes": [
        "Almost all reputable interpreters today recognize that Revelation is poetry and liturgy.",
        "The book of Ecclesiastes is in the canonical Scripture for a very good reason."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond 'what the book is like' to 'what the text says.' Incorporate specific exegetical insights from the Hebrew/Greek context to ground the theological claims."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Application is the sermon's strongest point. It avoids generalities by referencing specific local context (Essex), contemporary cultural debates (Halloween/multiculturalism), and personal tragedy (brain tumors, aging). It captures the zeitgeist of skepticism.",
      "quotes": [
        "Essex, Connecticut really is the best small town in America...",
        "our daughter has not yet had her brain tumor.",
        "Ivy League professors... The New York Times quoted an august professor..."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon avoids the 'block' structure (first theory, then practice). It moves between the text and the hearer's world (the cemetery, the family photo). However, the 'exposition' is so light that the movement feels more like a thematic essay than a textual drawing-in.",
      "quotes": [
        "You have a beautiful cemetery here in Essex, and I have walked in it many times. Sometimes I think how people will some day walk past my own grave..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the textual exposition so that the 'drawing in' involves the specific logic of the Bible passage, not just its general sentiment."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon leans heavily into 'misery' (via Ecclesiastes) and 'redemption' (via Revelation). It avoids 'soft' misery, acknowledging death and meaninglessness as real threats. Gratitude is present in the concluding doxology.",
      "quotes": [
        "The hearts of men are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.",
        "the God who raised his Son Jesus Christ from the dead is a God who is able to keep his promises."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Strengthen the 'gratitude' (sanctification) aspect; the sermon ends on hope/redemption but says little about the life of the saint in response to this grace."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon takes the possibility of being 'lost in time' (meaninglessness) very seriously. It addresses the 'dusty death' as a real possibility if the Word is not true. However, the 'narrow way' as a call to responsibility is less defined than the existential dread.",
      "quotes": [
        "Is 'dusty death' all there is? Does our tale signify anything?",
        "the possibility that Macbeth might be right."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the 'Lamb' and the one who 'raised from the dead,' but He functions more as a guarantor of a future state than the telos of the entire sermon. The 'two natures' doctrine is implicit but not a driving force.",
      "quotes": [
        "The celestial vision arises out of the Revelation of Jesus Christ himself...",
        "the God who raised his Son Jesus Christ from the dead..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make Christ the telos of the sermon's movement, not just the source of the information. Show how the specific text points to Him as the only life man has outside himself."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At roughly 16.5 minutes (1650 words), the sermon falls short of Dekker’s 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for true 'depth,' moving too quickly between disparate biblical books.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Slow down. Spend more time in the 'misery' of one text and the 'redemption' of another to allow the theological weight to settle."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily due to its lack of focus on a single, specific Bible passage and its insufficient length. It functions more as a thematic meditation on 'All Saints' using the Bible as a resource for ideas rather than an actualization of the Word. However, it succeeds in its concrete, psychological application and its refusal to offer 'sentimental happy endings' without confronting the reality of misery.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application that engages the zeitgeist and personal suffering without clichés.",
      "Serious treatment of 'misery' and the existential threat of being lost in time.",
      "Effective use of local and personal narrative to ground theological claims."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of a specific pericope; the sermon is a 'speech about ideas' (Thesis 1.3).",
      "Insufficient duration (under 20 minutes) prevents the necessary 'breadth' for depth.",
      "Exegesis is superficial, lacking the 'Hebrew and Greek' rigor Dekker demands."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate homiletical address, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict sense of Dekker’s definition. It prioritizes a thematic 'quiz' over the recreation of a specific written Word into a current proclamatory Word."
