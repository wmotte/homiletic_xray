    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative 'games'. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, engaging the listener's intellect and reality-testing regarding death and grief. By validating the 'night' of human experience (Nurturing Parent), it builds a bridge to the theological claim of the Resurrection without resorting to Critical Parent coercion. The preacher avoids the Drama Triangle by not casting the congregation as helpless victims, but as thinking subjects faced with a mystery.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of Adult-Adult engagement.",
      "Authentic validation of grief without 'smothering' the listener.",
      "Avoidance of the 'Bait & Switch' game; the darkness is treated with honesty."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the 'darkness of death' to the 'victory' is very rapid; more Adult processing on how one lives in the 'already/not yet' could strengthen it."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' to process existential fears. Ensure that the 'Do you believe?' remains an invitation to the listener's Free Child/Adult and never slips into a Critical Parent 'test' of orthodoxy."
