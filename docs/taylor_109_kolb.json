    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience primarily through the emotional weight of the parting occasion. The preacher uses the 'hook' of a final farewell to connect with the congregation's immediate feelings of loss and transition. However, it lacks specific 'slices of life' from the congregation's daily routine, focusing instead on the preacher's personal history and the shared experience of the worship space.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Reflection is present but often moves quickly toward theological conclusions. The preacher explores the 'problem' of human tampering with truth by referencing the US Constitution and South African law. While these are powerful, the analysis of *why* humans feel the need to reduce the Gospel is somewhat brief, leaning more on the gravity of the warning than on an exploration of the human condition's resistance to truth.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The theological exposition focuses on the sufficiency and finality of Scripture. The 'big idea' is the unchangeable nature of God's Word as a legacy. While the exegesis of Revelation 22 is straightforward, the sermon excels in connecting this specific text to the broader concept of the 'Canon' and the 'Grace' that concludes it. It is more dogmatic than analytical.",

      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase in terms of specific, daily-life application. The 'action' is primarily liturgical and spiritual: 'marching on' and 'praying'. While the ethical call to not 'add or take away' from the Word is clear, the sermon lacks concrete steps for how a layperson implements this in a secular Monday-to-Friday context. It remains largely in the realm of spiritual posture.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of visionary and declarative preaching within a narrative frame. It effectively utilizes the 'Concrete Experience' of a final farewell to anchor a 'Declarative' defense of the Word's integrity. While it succeeds in creating a profound emotional and theological moment, it falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase. The applications remain at a high level of spiritual abstraction ('march on', 'pray'), which, while appropriate for the occasion, leaves the 'Converging' learner with few practical handles. The 'Reflective Observation' is insightful regarding cultural parallels but could more deeply probe the congregation's specific existential situation. Overall, it is an effective piece of oratory that prioritizes inspiration and legacy over practical instruction.",

      "Move from 'what the Word is' to 'how the Word is used' in daily decision-making"
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a powerful homiletical event that successfully completes the movement from experience to vision. Its primary achievement is the creation of a 'sacred moment' through the synthesis of personal history and biblical authority. However, from a Kolb perspective, the cycle is incomplete due to the thinness of the Active Experimentation phase. It functions more as a 'monument' than a 'map'—inspiring the traveler but providing limited directions for the road ahead. For this specific occasion, the imbalance is understandable, but for a regular preaching practice, more attention to practical utility would be required."
