As a secular friend said, “Hey, your man made it!” The Newsweek article is the best. Kenneth Woodward, that fine religion reporter, tries his best as a good journalist [...] the risen Lord looks at you this very day — looks past Thomas and the other disciples through the walls of All Saints’ Chapel and across eternity and says, “Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet believe.” Alleluia! Amen."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon focuses on the pericope of Thomas. It identifies the uniqueness of Thomas's confession as the 'highest titles given to Jesus.' However, it leans heavily on the general 'Easter message' rather than extracting a truth that can be found 'nowhere else.' It treats the text as a representative example of faith vs. sight rather than a unique revelation.",
      "quotes": [
        "The words that Thomas speaks — My Lord and my God — are the supreme titles given to Jesus in the Bible.",
        "Thomas has come down to us as 'doubting Thomas,' but that is really a misnomer."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Isolate what is unique to John 20:29 compared to other 'faith' passages (like Hebrews 11). Focus more on the specific 'impertinent demand' of Thomas as a unique human reaction to the Risen Lord."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The exegesis is descriptive rather than analytical. While it references the Prologue of John and Calvin/MacLaren, there is no evidence of the 'Hebrew and Greek' requirement or a deep dive into the Johannine theology of 'signs' (semeia). It functions more as a narrative retelling.",
      "quotes": [
        "Modern commentators are agreed that... Thomas did not actually touch Jesus.",
        "The fourth Gospel has come full circle; the proclamation of the Prologue... reaches its true destination on the lips of Thomas."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate deeper Johannine exegesis regarding the relationship between 'seeing' and 'believing' in the Greek text to move beyond narrative description."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is largely anecdotal (the story of the usher in New York) or general. It addresses 'anyone wondering if the Resurrection could possibly be true,' which is a general category. It lacks the 'broad knowledge of humanities' or sharp 'zeitgeist' analysis Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "I was beginning to feel really bummed.",
        "Is there anyone here today who is wondering if the Resurrection could possibly be true?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond personal travelogues. Analyze why the modern 'zeitgeist' demands 'proofs' (Stigmata, Lost Ark) and how that specifically conflicts with the Word-based faith of the text."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a 'story-then-lesson' structure. The first half is a personal anecdote about New York, the second half is the biblical story, and the end is the application. They are not 'mixed' or 'one movement' as Dekker requires.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have a vivid memory of the first Easter Sunday I spent in New York City in 1982.",
        "On the evening of the day of Resurrection... the disciple Thomas had a lot more to feel depressed about."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Abolish the long introductory anecdote. Start within the text and let the contemporary world be 'expounded' through the lens of Thomas's obstinacy from the start."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Misery is present in Thomas's 'obstinate' disbelief and 'bummed' state. Redemption is the 'boundless graciousness' of Jesus. Gratitude is the 'My Lord and my God' response. However, the 'misery' is somewhat psychological/mood-based rather than 'misery before God.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Thomas was a congenital pessimist... certain that things would turn out badly.",
        "Jesus’ willingness to meet Thomas’s conditions exposes the disciple’s effrontery."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect. It is not just being 'bummed' or 'pessimistic'; it is the radical 'faithlessness' that Jesus rebukes."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are almost entirely absent. There is no sense of the 'seriousness of being lost' or the 'ultimate possibilities of life design.' The tone is comforting rather than confrontational regarding the choice of faith.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus doesn’t let Thomas forget it, though.",
        "Blessed are they who have not seen and yet have believed."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the consequence of remaining 'faithless.' What does it mean to be 'lost in time' by refusing the testimony of the Church?"
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Strongest point. Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon emphasizes that grace precedes knowledge of sin and that Christ is the one who 'brings faith to completion.' The two-natures doctrine is implicit in the 'My Lord and my God' section.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus actually grants to Thomas the signs which he so presumptuously had demanded. It is a perfect example of the way grace goes before knowledge of sin.",
        "Man has no life in himself, it is Christ who is his life."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'two-natures' doctrine more explicit to ground the 'My Lord and my God' confession in dogmatic reality as Dekker suggests."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 14.5 minutes (1450 words), the sermon fails Dekker’s absolute minimum of 20 minutes. It lacks the 'breadth' required for 'depth.'",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the theological exposition and the concrete application to the congregation's specific context to reach the 20-minute threshold."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily in its length, its reliance on lengthy personal anecdotes, and its lack of the 'two ways' (the seriousness of being lost). It functions more as a narrative encouragement than a rigorous exposition and application of a specific Word of God. While Christocentric and grounded in grace, it lacks the 'sharpness' and humanities-based depth required for a 'true sermon' in Dekker's sense.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christocentric focus where Christ is the telos of the message.",
      "Clear identification of grace as preceding human response.",
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' (misery, redemption, gratitude) as a background framework."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient duration (under 20 minutes) preventing necessary depth.",
      "Over-reliance on personal narrative (New York anecdote) which occupies too much space relative to the text.",
      "Absence of the 'two ways' and the existential weight of being lost.",
      "Application remains too general and psychological rather than concrete and contemporary."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "According to Dekker’s strict definition, this is an 'inadequate' sermon. It lacks the formal requirement of length and the substantive requirement of the 'two ways.' It risks being a 'speech about the gospel' rather than a specific actualization of the Word."
