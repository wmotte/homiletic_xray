    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating a 'sense of place' for ancient Smyrna, using historical and geographical details to paint a picture. Taylor uses sensory language to contrast the physical city with the spiritual state of the church. However, the imagery becomes more abstract when discussing 'wealth' later in the sermon, shifting from the 'gray marble floor' to more conceptual lists of blessings. The 'show, don't tell' principle is strongly applied in the historical introduction but weakens during the moral application regarding greed.",
      "quotes": [
        "It was said by the Asians that its feet were in the sea and its head was crowned by a great hill that rose over Smyrna.",
        "Two-legged, eyeglass-wearing gods? Bald-headed, pot-bellied gods? Teeth-decaying, hair-falling gods?",
        "You can still see in the city of Smyrna the gray marble floor of what was once a temple to Tiberius."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Vivid personification of the city of Smyrna.",
        "Effective use of grotesque imagery to deconstruct the 'divinity' of Roman emperors.",
        "Concrete historical markers that make the biblical world tangible."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The metaphors for 'wealth' (health, limbs) are somewhat conventional and could be more fresh.",
        "The 'lottery' daydream could be expanded into a more vivid narrative scene.",
        "The transition from the 'stench' of persecution to the 'balm' of myrrh could be more sensorially developed."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strong 'showing' in the first half regarding the city and the emperors; shifts to 'telling' during the critique of modern greed and the exhortation to trust."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Taylor demonstrates a high degree of stewardship of language, avoiding dense academic jargon while maintaining a sophisticated vocabulary. He uses 'Canaanite language' (e.g., 'marvelous light of his grace') but usually anchors it in the lived experience of the congregation. There is a slight tendency toward generalization when discussing 'that other crowd' (non-churchgoers), which lacks the precision seen in his historical descriptions. His use of the 'parenthesis' as a grammatical metaphor for grace is a highlight of linguistic precision.",
      "quotes": [
        "There are endless volumes of God's grace inside this parenthesis.",
        "So said these poor, lame-brained, half-educated Johnny-come-latelies.",
        "The pivot. You follow me—the turning point, the core, the heart, the sine qua non of the New Testament."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent use of grammatical metaphors (the parenthesis).",
        "Clear, accessible language that bridges the gap between the 1st and 20th centuries.",
        "Strong rhetorical use of synonyms to build emphasis."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Some descriptions of 'the world' (poker games, parties) border on caricature.",
        "The term 'Johnny-come-latelies' is evocative but perhaps lacks the 'loving language' McEntyre advocates for.",
        "The transition between the Edsel Ford anecdote and the definition of wealth is slightly abrupt."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Theological terms like 'tribulation' and 'grace' are used frequently but are contextualized through the lens of social deprivation and economic struggle."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest aesthetic feature. Taylor utilizes the 'musicality' of the African American preaching tradition. The use of parallelism, repetition (anaphora), and varying sentence lengths creates a rhythmic cadence that builds toward the 'climax' or 'celebration' at the end. The rhythm is not merely decorative; it serves to reinforce the 'heartbeat' of the message—the reliability of the Resurrection. It is clearly oral language, meant to be heard and felt.",
      "quotes": [
        "Can God do it? He raised Christ from the dead. If God could do that, nothing, nothing is too hard for him.",
        "Two-legged, eyeglass-wearing gods? Bald-headed, pot-bellied gods?",
        "I will open doors for you. I will put bread on your table and I'll put a roof over your head."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Masterful use of the 'call and response' rhythm even in written form.",
        "Effective use of staccato questions followed by a consistent rhythmic answer.",
        "The 'musical' build-up in the conclusion creates a sense of inevitability."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The middle section on Japanese debt and Washington politics loses some of the rhythmic flow found in the beginning and end.",
        "Some sentences in the historical section are slightly long and 'bookish'.",
        "The transition into the Sister Marie anecdote breaks the established cadence."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Decidedly oral language. The structure is designed for breath, emphasis, and communal resonance."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high level of micro-aesthetic quality, particularly in its musicality and rhythmic structure. Taylor uses language not just to inform but to evoke a physical and emotional response. While the imagery is vivid in the historical sections, it becomes more conventional in the moral applications. The 'stewardship of language' is evident in the careful choice of rhetorical figures like the 'parenthesis of grace,' though some social critiques lack the same level of nuance. Overall, the language is vibrant, oral-centered, and effectively avoids the dryness of 'paper language'."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'Lowry-esque' loop to some extent, beginning with a 'confusing' subject (the upsetting of equilibrium) and moving through the 'trouble' of the Smyrna church. However, the structure is somewhat episodic. It moves from historical context to a critique of modern greed, then to a definition of wealth, and finally to the Resurrection. The 'tension' is maintained more by the preacher's delivery and rhythmic build than by a tight narrative plot. The turning point is the 'linchpin' of the Resurrection, which provides a strong resolution.",
      "quotes": [
        "This subject I found confusing. I did not know whether to call this the poor rich church or the rich poor church.",
        "But if we will put our hands in the Lord's keeping, he will give us strength.",
        "I do not know what your condition is, but it cannot be any worse than what God faced when Christ was in the tomb."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong opening that immediately poses a paradox to be solved.",
        "The conclusion successfully ties the 'poverty' of the hearer to the 'victory' of the Resurrection.",
        "Good movement from the 'then' of Smyrna to the 'now' of the congregation."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The section on Japanese debt and the Exxon building feels like a thematic detour that slows the narrative momentum.",
        "The transition from the Polycarp mention (which is teased but not told) to the critique of greed is a missed opportunity for narrative tension.",
        "The 'Sister Marie' anecdote feels disconnected from the primary arc of the Smyrna church."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A hybrid between a thematic 'points' structure and a dynamic journey; the rhythmic 'celebration' at the end provides the primary sense of movement."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Taylor excels at 'reframing' (Cilliers). He takes the ancient reality of Smyrna (economic disenfranchisement due to faith) and maps it onto the experience of the Black church in America. He reframes 'poverty' not as a lack of money, but as a space where God's 'parenthesis of grace' operates. He challenges the 'health and wealth' gospel by using the biblical text to show that true wealth is found in 'wearing the colors of Christ' amidst suffering. This is a sophisticated synthesis of text and context.",
      "quotes": [
        "The people in our black community... who are going to work, and earning a living... are church people.",
        "What is it? What is the lust in us that makes us want to be more than what humans were meant to be?",
        "You are wearing my colors!"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Direct and courageous application to the socio-economic reality of the congregation.",
        "Effective 'reframing' of the word 'atheist' and 'wealth'.",
        "The connection between Roman emperor worship and the 'imperial presidency' is a sharp contextual bridge."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The critique of 1980s greed could be more deeply rooted in the specific 'ten days' of tribulation mentioned in the text.",
        "The 'lottery' daydream is a bit of a cliché context-link.",
        "More could be made of the 'myrrh' (Smyrna) metaphor in relation to modern healing."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes, the sermon successfully reframes the congregation's struggle as a participation in the 'richness' of the suffering church of Smyrna."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward a 'closed' structure. While it acknowledges the 'struggle from the cradle to the grave,' it provides very definitive, almost formulaic answers ('He raised Christ from the dead'). There is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' that Stark or Cilliers advocate for. The ending is a triumphant resolution that leaves few questions unanswered. While this provides comfort (consolatio), it risks becoming a 'coercive schema' where the complexity of suffering is quickly swallowed by the rhetoric of victory.",
      "quotes": [
        "Whatever it is, I will raise up friends for you. I will open doors for you.",
        "Yes, God can see about me. No matter how far I drift... God can bring me through.",
        "What God has done for others... God can do for you."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Provides strong pastoral assurance and 'consolatio'.",
        "The 'parenthesis' metaphor allows for a layer of mystery within the text.",
        "Acknowledges the reality of struggle ('life is not an easy business')."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'I will put bread on your table' promises can feel overly prescriptive and 'closed' to those whose tables remain empty.",
        "Allow more space for the 'ten days' of trial to be felt before the 'crown of life' is offered.",
        "The conclusion could benefit from an invitation to reflect rather than just a series of declarations."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily a closed work of art; it functions as a 'proclamation of certainty' rather than an 'exploration of meaning'."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is solid but traditional. The sermon moves from a paradoxical opening to a triumphant liturgical climax. Its strength lies in the 'reframing' of the biblical text for a specific socio-economic context, making the ancient Smyrna church a mirror for the modern Black church. However, the structure is somewhat episodic and 'closed,' offering immediate and certain resolutions to the tensions it raises. While this fits the 'witness' model of preaching, it leaves less room for the 'open work' interpretation favored by modern aesthetic homiletics."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon flirts with kitsch in its use of 'happy ending' rhetoric and certain clichés ('put bread on your table', 'wearing the colors'). However, it avoids pure kitsch through its grounding in the historical reality of persecution and the socio-economic struggle of the Black community. The 'pot-bellied gods' imagery provides a gritty, anti-kitsch realism that punctures religious sentimentality. The emotion feels authentic because it is tied to a history of 'tribulation' that the preacher and congregation share.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'Sister Marie' horse-racing anecdote feels like a 'pre-chewed' sermon illustration.",
      "The promise that God will 'put bread on your table' can function as a cliché that bypasses the pain of those in systemic poverty."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The deconstruction of the 'bald-headed, pot-bellied' emperors.",
      "The honest admission: 'desperately wanted, under God, not to disgrace his people'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To increase depth, the preacher could dwell longer on the 'Polycarp' reality—the fact that faithfulness sometimes leads to death, not just 'bread on the table'."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'parenthesis' metaphor. Taylor suggests that within the 'poverty' of the human condition, there is a hidden, divine richness that is unavailable to the 'greedy.' However, the space is somewhat narrowed by the moralistic critique of 'that other crowd' (non-churchgoers). The Resurrection is presented as the ultimate 'Space for Grace'—the place where the impossible becomes possible.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are raised (poverty vs. wealth) but are resolved quite quickly through the rhythmic repetition of the Resurrection formula.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'mystery' of how one is rich while poor is respected, but the 'mystery' of God's silence in suffering is less explored.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the conclusion, but moralization (regarding greed and church attendance) is prominent in the middle section.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'silence' of the tomb to be felt more deeply before the 'empty' tomb is proclaimed, creating more 'space' for those currently in the 'ten days' of trial."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.7,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of the 'Aesthetic of the Word' within the African American homiletical tradition. Its aesthetic power lies in its rhythmic cadence, its ability to reframe ancient texts for contemporary social struggle, and its vivid, sometimes gritty imagery. Gardner C. Taylor acts as a 'witness' (Long), testifying to the reality of the Resurrection as the 'linchpin' of existence. While the sermon occasionally falls into 'closed' structures and conventional illustrations, it maintains a high level of 'sober beauty' and rhetorical precision. The 'musicality' of the text ensures that the form is indeed part of the content—the rhythm itself communicates the heartbeat of hope. It avoids the 'kitsch' of the prosperity gospel by grounding 'wealth' in spiritual identity and communal resilience rather than mere material gain.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rhythmic and musical use of language (Domain A3).",
      "Creative reframing of 'poverty' and 'wealth' (Domain B2).",
      "Vivid historical 'painting' of the city of Smyrna (Domain A1)."

      "Increase 'openness' by allowing questions to linger (Domain B3).",
      "Avoid episodic detours (like the Japanese debt) to strengthen the narrative arc (Domain B1).",
      "Replace conventional anecdotes (Sister Marie) with more original narrative scenes."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Rhythmic (Classic Black Homiletic)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Gerrit Immink's 'Performance' (the holy happens in the rhythmic event) and Johan Cilliers' 'Reframing'.",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who value oral tradition, emotional resonance, and a connection between faith and social identity.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the congregation in the 'between' space of Smyrna's trial.",
      "Use more 'sensory' language when describing the 'crown of life' to match the vividness of the 'pot-bellied gods'.",
      "Deepen the 'stewardship of language' by avoiding caricatures of those outside the church."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically effective 'event' that uses the power of rhythm and reframing to offer 'consolatio' to a struggling community. While it prioritizes 'certainty' over 'polyvalence,' its linguistic care and historical imagination elevate it above standard thematic preaching. It is a 'sober-beautiful' performance of the Resurrection faith."
