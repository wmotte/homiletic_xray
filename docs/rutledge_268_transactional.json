    "psychological_health_score": 7,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically sophisticated, moving from a shared 'Child' experience of wonder to a 'Nurturing Parent' stance of theological rescue. It avoids the toxic 'Critical Parent' traps common in traditional preaching but risks creating a dependency by emphasizing human total incapacity. The preacher uses his own vulnerability as a 'Con' to establish trust before switching to a dogmatic 'Rescuer' role. However, the warmth and inclusion of 'outsiders' make it significantly healthier than standard fire-and-brimstone or shame-based models.",
    "strengths": [
      "High empathy and validation of the listeners' emotional reality.",
      "Successful deconstruction of the 'Critical Parent' clerical stereotype.",
      "Strong use of Free Child imagery to engage the audience."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Total Depravity' angle (humans as 'utterly incapable') can reinforce a 'Victim' script.",
      "The transition from 'we are all in this together' to 'I bring you the gift' creates a hierarchy that undermines the earlier solidarity."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to invite the congregation's 'Adult' to partner with God's grace, rather than positioning the 'Child' as a helpless victim who must be rescued from another dimension. This promotes autonomy and 'I'm OK, You're OK' rather than 'I'm OK (because I have faith), You're Not OK (because you are incapable).'"
