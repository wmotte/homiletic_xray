        "score": 8,
        "score_explanation": "10 = Completely free from coercive judgments. The preacher largely avoids using 'must' or 'should' as a weapon, instead externalizing the Critical Parent into the 'Law' or 'Mother/Father' figures.",
        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher identifies the Critical Parent as an external/internal enemy (the 'thundering verdict') rather than speaking from that position. Coercion is described as a symptom of the 'Law of Sin' rather than a tool of the pulpit.",
        "quotes": [
          "The fear of being pronounced guilty by some terrifying power haunts us all our lives",

        "presence": "Medium",
        "analysis": "The care is supportive and empathetic, particularly through shared vulnerability (athletic failure). However, it leans toward a 'Nurturing Parent' who provides the solution to the 'Child's' terror.",
        "quotes": [
          "It gives me the greatest imaginable joy to preach today on this text",
          "I was profoundly moved and humbled by the open sincerity and trustfulness of Dorothy’s new life"

      "score": 6,

      "presence": "Medium",
      "analysis": "The preacher addresses the listener as a thinking subject by citing Camus, Conrad, and the NYT. However, the 'Adult' is used primarily to validate the 'Child's' fear before the 'Parent' (God) steps in.",
      "quotes": [
        "The word 'law' has many meanings here, but one of them is that of an inexorable activity... like the law of gravity."

        "presence_of_adaptation": "High",
        "analysis": "The preacher speaks from a place of shared Adapted Child experience (being chosen last, disappointment to parents). While authentic, it keeps the congregation in a state of 'primitive terror' to make the Gospel 'payoff' more effective.",

    "primary_transaction_style": "Parent -> Child (Complementary)",
    "analysis": "The preacher identifies a universal 'Child' wound (fear of judgment) and provides a 'Parental' solution (God's acquittal). It is a stable, comforting transaction that bypasses the Adult's need for behavioral change in favor of emotional relief.",

    "risk_explanation": "The risk is a 'double bottom' where the promise of 'no condemnation' (NP) is later used to demand 'transformation' (CP), potentially re-triggering the 'not good enough' cycle."

      "victim": "Low/Medium. The preacher identifies as a 'Victim' of his own un-athletic past to build rapport."

    "escape_possibilities": "The sermon offers an escape through 'Transformation' (Adult/Spirit), but the heavy emphasis on the 'Not Guilty' verdict keeps the focus on the relief of the Victim."
  },
  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 7,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically sophisticated, using TA-adjacent concepts (parental influence, internal scripts) to explain theological 'Law'. It effectively moves the listener from a state of 'Adapted Child' fear to 'Free Child' relief. However, it risks a subtle 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' (ITHY) dynamic by suggesting that the 'Not Guilty' verdict is only the start of a new set of expectations (transformation), which could lead back to the 'not good enough' script if the transformation is slow.",
    "strengths": [
      "High empathy and shared vulnerability.",
      "Rejection of the Critical Parent/Persecutor role.",
      "Clear identification of internal 'scripts' (the message of the cut)."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to 'transformation' (Romans 8:4) could be perceived as a new 'Law' if not carefully handled.",
      "Heavy reliance on the 'Child' ego state may inhibit 'Adult' spiritual maturity."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To remain game-free, ensure the 'transformation' section is framed as an Adult choice/empowerment rather than a Nurturing Parent's new requirement for the Child."
