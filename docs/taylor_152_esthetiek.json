    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily through traditional metaphors and biblical archetypes. There is a clear attempt to 'paint the picture' of the gossip surrounding Jesus, using sensory-adjacent language like 'poisoned whisper' and 'finger pointers'. However, the imagery often leans toward the conventional rather than the original. The preacher successfully evokes the 'dump-heap' and 'garbage-pile' of society to illustrate the outcasts, which provides a visceral contrast to the 'holy man' image. While the 'show, don't tell' principle is applied during the description of the slanderers, the later parts of the sermon rely more on 'telling' through biblical citations. The imagery is effective for a general audience but lacks the fresh, startling metaphors that Cilliers or Wilson advocate for to truly 'reframe' perception.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The language is accessible but occasionally falls into repetitive religious jargon. The preacher uses 'stewardship of language' well when distinguishing between the roles of doctors, lawyers, and ministers, showing precision in logic. However, as the sermon progresses, it adopts a more 'pulpit-heavy' vocabulary ('gainsayers', 'winebibber', 'transgressors') which, while biblically grounded, borders on the 'Canaanite' language McEntyre warns against. There is a certain lack of nuance in the description of 'other cultures' debauching themselves, which feels like a generalization. The precision of human experience is somewhat sacrificed for the sake of rhetorical flourish toward the end.",
      "quotes": [
        "Each idle tongue, each wicked heart, each twisted brain adds its own stinging twist.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits strong oral qualities, likely designed for a rhythmic delivery. The use of parallelism ('Our Friend by day... Our Friend by night') and alliteration ('libel his label', 'dump-heap, garbage-pile') creates a cadence that aids memorability. The sentence structure varies effectively between short, punchy declarations and longer, flowing biblical quotations. The preacher understands the 'musicality' of the pulpit, using repetition to build emotional momentum. While it occasionally feels like 'paper language' in the more academic sections, the overall flow is conducive to an oral 'event' as described by Immink.",
      "quotes": [
        "Our Friend he is by day and our Friend by night. Our Friend in bright days and in dark.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 6.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is rhetorically capable, utilizing traditional homiletical tools like alliteration and rhythmic repetition. It successfully moves from the mundane (household sayings) to the sublime (the cross). However, it is hampered by a reliance on conventional religious metaphors and occasionally archaic vocabulary. While it 'shows' the social tension of Jesus' ministry well, it eventually retreats into 'telling' through a heavy density of scripture. It is a solid example of mid-century pulpit rhetoric—effective and rhythmic, but lacking the linguistic 'stewardship' of modern precision."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' as described by Lowry. It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' by challenging a common proverb. This creates immediate interest. The 'conflict' is the slander against Jesus, and the 'turning point' is Jesus' acceptance and transformation of that slander. The movement from the 'bad apple' to the 'Sinner's Friend' provides a coherent journey. However, the energy tends to plateau in the middle during the long string of biblical citations. The conclusion is a traditional 'resolution' that offers comfort but perhaps lacks a final 'open' hook to keep the hearer reflecting beyond the sanctuary.",
      "quotes": [
        "With this ground clearing, it is now necessary to go on to say...",
        "Jesus accepted the label, the slander, and turned it into the brightest jewel...",
        "I speak not of the persuasive powers of any preacher. Forget the preacher! Remember the gospel!"

      "strengths": [
        "The 'ground clearing' introduction effectively hooks the audience with relatable wisdom.",
        "The dramatic reversal of 'libel to label' serves as a strong structural pivot.",
        "The movement from social gossip to cosmic salvation is logically sound."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The middle section (biblical proofs) feels like a static list; it needs more narrative tension.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The integration is one of the sermon's strongest points. The preacher successfully 'reframes' the biblical text (the accusation of being a friend of sinners) by placing it against the backdrop of modern social reputation and gossip. By starting with 'household sayings', the preacher creates a bridge between the hearer's daily reality and the biblical world. The 'reframing' occurs when the hearer realizes that what they consider a social negative (bad company) is the very heart of God's grace. This synthesis feels organic rather than forced, though the 'context' remains somewhat general and 'timeless' rather than specifically historical to the 21st century.",
      "quotes": [
        "A person is known by the company he or she keeps... his critics applied its principle to him.",
        "Jesus, shedding the unbending asceticism of John, came in quite the opposite way.",
        "The 'common' then meant sinners. Rejoice, my sinful soul..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent use of the 'reframing' technique regarding the concept of 'company'.",
        "The connection between the 'doctor's' company and 'Jesus' company is a strong logical bridge.",
        "The sermon honors the 'strangeness' of Jesus' social choices."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'context' could be more concrete—who are the 'outcasts' in the hearer's specific city today?",
        "Avoid the 'then vs. now' binary by showing how the text still 'disturbs' our current social frames.",
        "The application to 'young people' at the start feels a bit disconnected from the later theological depth."

      "reframing_present": "Yes, it successfully reframes 'bad reputation' as 'divine grace'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "Aesthetically, the sermon is quite 'closed'. Following Stark's 'open work of art', this sermon leaves little room for the hearer's own interpretation or ambivalence. It is a 'closed system of truths' that are delivered with authority. The preacher answers all questions and resolves all tensions with traditional dogmatic statements. While the invitation is warm, it is prescriptive ('He bids us come... never mind our condition'). There is little room for the 'resistance' or 'doubt' that Stark and Cilliers suggest are necessary for a truly aesthetic encounter with the Holy. It is a 'monovalent' work that seeks to persuade rather than invite into a mystery.",
      "quotes": [
        "I cannot understand how anybody... can remain cold of heart and unmoved.",

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Closed work of art; monovalent and prescriptive."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 5.67,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon has a well-defined narrative arc that moves from human proverbs to divine grace. Its strength lies in the 'reframing' of social reputation as a vehicle for the gospel. However, the structure is aesthetically 'closed', leaving little room for the hearer's active interpretation or the sustaining of existential tension. It functions as a persuasive speech rather than an 'open work of art'. The dramaturgy is effective for traditional proclamation but lacks the 'polyphony' required for a more modern aesthetic experience."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 5,
    "analysis": "The sermon teeters on the edge of religious kitsch. While it avoids the most egregious 'happy ending' clichés by focusing on the 'dump-heap' and 'outcasts', it falls into kitsch through its use of pre-chewed emotional language ('bathes my eyes in thankful tears', 'brightest jewel in the crown'). The resolution of the 'sinner's' problem is presented somewhat easily, without fully exploring the 'pain of suffering' or the complexity of sin. It offers 'immediate comfort' (kitsch) rather than 'authentic emotion'. However, the gritty description of the 'poisoned whisper' and the 'riff-raff' provides some authentic aesthetic depth that saves it from being pure kitsch.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'brightest jewel in the dear Savior's crown' metaphor.",
      "The phrase 'bathes my eyes in thankful tears'—a pre-packaged emotional response."

      "The raw list of the 'bruised, the abused, the second class, and the sickened class'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Avoid 'pious' adjectives and pre-packaged emotional descriptions. Let the facts of the gospel evoke the emotion rather than telling the audience how they should feel (e.g., 'I cannot understand how anybody... can remain cold')."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully opens a 'space for grace' by emphasizing that Jesus' friendship is not based on the hearer's merit. Cilliers' concept of 'reframing' is present: reality is seen through the lens of a God who chooses 'bad company'. However, the space is partially closed by the preacher's moralizing tone at the beginning and the 'sealed' nature of the conclusion. The 'mystery' of the incarnation is explained away through logical analogies (the doctor, the lawyer) rather than being allowed to stand in its own 'strangeness'.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are mostly resolved quickly through theological declarations.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery is largely 'explained' through analogies and scripture proofs.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the content, but the tone remains somewhat moralistic/prescriptive.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'scandal' of Jesus' company to remain scandalous without immediately domesticating it with the 'doctor' analogy."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 5.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a robust example of traditional rhetorical homiletics. Its primary aesthetic strength lies in its 'reframing' of social reputation and its rhythmic, oral quality. It successfully takes a common human experience (gossip and reputation) and uses it as a lens to view the gospel. However, from the perspective of the 'aesthetic turn', it is overly 'closed' and occasionally 'kitsch'. It relies on 'telling' the audience how to feel and what to believe, rather than 'showing' the reality of grace in a way that invites the hearer into an 'open work of art'. The language is evocative but often relies on clichéd religious imagery that lacks the precision of 'stewardship of language'. It is a sermon that 'meets' the requirements of effective communication but does not reach the level of an aesthetically transformative event.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "The rhetorical 'reframing' of Jesus' reputation from 'libel' to 'label'.",
      "Strong rhythmic cadence and use of parallelism in the oral delivery.",
      "Effective 'ground clearing' that connects the biblical text to universal human experiences."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Move away from 'religious kitsch' and pre-packaged emotional phrases.",
      "Increase the 'openness' of the sermon to allow for hearer interpretation and ambivalence.",
      "Modernize the imagery to avoid 'Canaanite' jargon and archaic metaphors."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Academic-Declarative with Narrative-Dramatic elements.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'New Homiletic' (Wilson/Long) in its use of imagery and plot, but lacks the 'Open Work' quality of Stark or the 'Sober Beauty' of Reformed aesthetics.",
    "audience_analysis": "Traditional, churched hearers who find comfort in authoritative, rhythmic proclamation and biblical proof-texting.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer with a lingering question.",
      "Use more 'secular' or contemporary metaphors to describe grace, avoiding 'jewels' and 'crowns'.",
      "Focus on 'showing' the struggle of the outcasts rather than just 'listing' them."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a competent piece of homiletical craft that functions well within a traditional liturgical framework. It achieves its goal of comfort and proclamation. However, it lacks the 'aesthetic depth' that comes from sustaining tension, respecting mystery, and avoiding the shortcuts of religious sentimentality. It is a 'closed' work that prioritizes dogmatic clarity over aesthetic exploration."
