However, it heavily utilizes the Drama Triangle, casting the world as a Persecutor (greed, drugs, TV), the listeners as Victims (maimed, hungering), and Christ/the Preacher as the Rescuer. While theologically 'orthodox,' it risks creating a 'shame-relief' cycle where the listener is made to feel 'naked' and 'maimed' before being offered the 'Bread' as a psychological sedative.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to maintain the Adult ego position when discussing social failings. Instead of labeling greed an 'abomination' (CP), analyze its 'here-and-now' consequences on the human psyche (Adult), allowing the listener to reach their own moral conclusion."
