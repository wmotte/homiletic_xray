In the Book of Acts, the early Christians are big public players [...] Because we know about this, we are like Peter and John: . . . we cannot keep from speaking about what we have seen and heard. (Acts 4:20) We join in the walking, the leaping, the praise of God. We are a part of the watching crowd . . . filled with wonder and amazement . . . and gratitude at what has happened (3:10)."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Acts 3 and 4. While it follows the narrative arc, it treats the text more as a 'biblical idea' (resurrection as social change) than as a unique word. It fails to identify what is in this text that can be found nowhere else, settling for a general theme of 'healing vs. money'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The text is about a sick man who is healed, who now is present in public in good health.",
        "The sum of this long narrative is about resurrection; but it is resurrection concretely enacted in the healing of this nameless beggar."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Isolate the specific linguistic and theological tension of the 'Name' in Acts 4:12 (which is omitted) to show why *this* specific healing triggered a legal crisis, rather than treating it as a general example of 'alternative medicine'."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is superficial. There is no mention of the Greek text or the specific theological history of Israel. The 'rulers and scribes' are flattened into a modern 'power structure' without explaining their specific religious-political role in Jerusalem.",
      "quotes": [
        "The entire power structure of the community was assembled.",
        "Peter and John, good Jews that they are, are on their way to the temple."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the specific messianic expectations of the time and the linguistic significance of 'salvation' (soteria) which in Greek implies both healing and eternal rescue."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the healthcare system and 'money management,' which aligns with Dekker's demand for cultural philosophy. However, it risks becoming a 'general truth' about social justice rather than a specific application of the Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have reduced health care to money management and drug companies...",
        "It is predictable that a money scheme such as we have designed in our society cannot and will not have the power to heal."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the critique of 'drug companies' to the specific spiritual condition of the modern hearer's heart in relation to these systems."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon successfully avoids the 'first exposition, then application' trap. It moves back and forth between the courtroom in Acts and the modern health center, drawing the hearer into the narrative.",
      "quotes": [
        "What Peter does is to make a concrete linkage between the miracle of Easter and this practice of health care, a connection that matters in our own context today as well."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'present of revelation' is not just a social parallel but a theological event where God speaks now."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is present (disability/systemic greed) and gratitude is mentioned. However, redemption is dangerously close to being 'too objective' or social-horizontal. The 'misery' of the sinner before God is replaced by the 'misery' of a bad healthcare system.",
      "quotes": [
        "He is disabled, lame from birth we are told.",
        "We join in the walking, the leaping, the praise of God... and gratitude at what has happened."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' part to include the spiritual 'lameness' of the hearer before God, not just the systemic failures of society."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon hints at 'regime change' and 'conflict,' but the 'seriousness of being lost' is absent. It leans toward the liberal tradition of 'temporal loss' (society perishing) but lacks the individual urgency of eternal life or death.",
      "quotes": [
        "The one that is defensive is on the side of money, power, and the status quo—without healing.",
        "It costs your life. It brings you into conflict with the old patterns of life..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'ultimate possibilities' of the hearer's life design. What does it mean to be 'lost' if one rejects the 'Name' of Jesus?"
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, and the doctrine of the two natures is implicit in the 'power of the resurrection.' However, Christ is often used as a catalyst for human action ('alternative medicine') rather than the Savior outside of us.",
      "quotes": [
        "This man is standing before you in good health by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...",
        "The healing celebrated here concerns how women and men of faith... are among the needy and the sick."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Emphasize that salvation is 'outside ourselves' (extra nos) rather than just an 'empowerment' for our own healthcare practices."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At roughly 1450 words, the sermon lasts approximately 14-15 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for true depth.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical and dogmatic sections to reach the 20-minute threshold, allowing the text to breathe."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily in its length, lack of rigorous linguistic exegesis, and its tendency to transform the Gospel into a social-psychological 'alternative medicine.' While it successfully avoids a dry separation of text and life, it sacrifices the 'seriousness of the two ways' for a more palatable message of social empowerment.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective interwovenness of the biblical narrative with contemporary social structures.",
      "Strong emphasis on the 'Name' as the source of power, avoiding mere moralism.",
      "Clear identification of the 'misery' found in systemic greed and physical brokenness."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient duration (under 20 minutes) prevents necessary theological depth.",
      "Lack of original language engagement and historical-critical depth.",
      "The 'two ways' are reduced to social choices rather than the ultimate possibility of being lost before God."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an 'adequate' speech that borders on a sermon, but it lacks the formal 'breadth' and substantive 'seriousness' required by Dekker's theses. It functions more as a theological reflection on healthcare than a proclamatory recreation of the Word of God."
