    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates experience primarily through the narrative of Peter. The preacher uses the imagery of the 'fire' to create a sensory connection between Peter's failure and the reader's own life. However, it stays somewhat distant by focusing on a biblical character rather than immediately grounding the experience in the hearer's contemporary everyday life. The emotional weight relies heavily on the biblical drama rather than modern 'slices of life'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Imagine Peter seeing the Lord who he denied and betrayed... Jesus says, 'Hey! Let's sit down by the fire.'",

      "analysis": "This is a significant strength of the sermon. The preacher pauses to analyze the 'why' of human failure, using the concept of 'homo incurvatus in se' and the 'shame and honor culture' to provide perspective. He explores the problem of failure and the human tendency toward self-centeredness with depth, moving beyond superficial observation.",

The 'Big Idea' is that resurrection is a life-transforming power through grace, not just a moral example.

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of the 'Assimilating' style, focusing heavily on the relationship between Reflective Observation and Abstract Conceptualization. It succeeds in providing a deep, intellectually satisfying analysis of the Gospel and human failure. It fails to provide a robust 'Active Experimentation' phase, leaving the application at a general, internal level. The use of historical scholarship (Bauckham) and classical theology (Augustine) provides significant depth, but the transition to the 'four principles' feels somewhat mechanical. The emotional core—Peter at the fire—is the strongest element of Concrete Experience, but it is often overshadowed by the logical argumentation that follows. The sermon addresses the 'why' and 'what' exceptionally well, but the 'how' is less clear.",

      "Strategic advice 1: Spend more time on the 'Pragmatic' task of Osmer to help the congregation respond.",
      "Strategic advice 2: Use more modern-day parables to strengthen the Concrete Experience phase.",
      "Strategic advice 3: Experiment with an inductive structure that delays the 'four points' until the very end."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This is a well-constructed, intellectually stimulating sermon that provides deep theological insight into the nature of grace and failure. It is particularly effective for hearers who learn through logical models and reflection. However, from a Kolb perspective, it is incomplete due to the relative absence of concrete application (Active Experimentation). The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between 'understanding the achievement of the resurrection' and 'living its life' in specific, measurable ways. It is a strong '7'—a well-developed piece of homiletics that serves the 'head' and 'heart' but leaves the 'hands' searching for direction."
