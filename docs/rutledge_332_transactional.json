    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically coercive. It utilizes the 'Critical Parent' to dismantle the listener's self-esteem and boundaries, labeling healthy self-regard as 'blindness.' By using personal anecdotes that border on pastoral gossip, the preacher creates a 'NIGYSOB' dynamic where the listener's everyday experiences (shopping, social events) are weaponized against them to induce a 'Child' state of guilt.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try speaking from the Adult ego state: instead of diagnosing the 'blindness' of others, present the theology of the Cross as a data point for the listener's own reflection. Avoid 'Formula G' by not using pastoral stories to 'trap' the audience into a specific emotional response."
