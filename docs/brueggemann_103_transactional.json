    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and exceptionally 'game-free.' It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, providing a sophisticated structural analysis of human resistance to change. By categorizing resistance as 'maintenance' (a high-energy, defensive Parent/Child loop), the preacher empowers the listener to recognize their own psychological patterns without triggering shame. The transition to the 'News' invites the Free Child's creativity and the Adult's decision-making, promoting true autonomy rather than religious dependency.",

      "High levels of Adult-to-Adult transparency.",

      "The 'Orange Alert' metaphor is strong but could be expanded to show how the Adult processes reality differently than the fearful Child."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'we' pronoun to maintain the horizontal transaction. Ensure that the 'News' remains a 'gift and risk' (Adult) rather than a 'magic solution' (Rescuer)."
