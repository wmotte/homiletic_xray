  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon series is psychologically robust and exceptionally healthy. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the 'Critical Parent' by validating the 'Free Child's' right to question and doubt. By operating primarily from the 'Adult' ego state, the preacher fosters a sense of agency and intellectual honesty in the congregation. The refusal to offer 'pious platitudes' (Rescuer role) in the face of tragedy (the Alabama tornado example) protects the listener from the 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' game. The emphasis on God as 'Other' rather than a 'domesticated pet' encourages the listener to move toward a mature, autonomous faith that can tolerate ambiguity.",

      "High Adult-to-Adult transparency.",

      "Avoidance of the Drama Triangle."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the 'Why' to the 'Who' could be seen as a slight 'Parental' redirection, though it is handled with Adult reasoning.",
      "More 'Free Child' joy could balance the heavy 'Adult' processing of death and dust."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements regarding doubt and struggle; it effectively neutralizes the 'Rescuer' projection and keeps the transaction Adult-Adult."
