    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon employs imagery primarily as an illustrative tool rather than a foundational poetic layer. While it references sensory details from the text (mud, saliva, the pool), the preacher's own language tends toward the conceptual and psychological. The imagery of the 'tower falling' or the '120 stitches' provides concrete anchors, but the overall texture is more analytical than cinematic. According to Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' rule, this sermon leans heavily on 'telling'—explaining the mechanics of spiritual blindness rather than painting it. However, the use of the 'writing god' illustration effectively visualizes the internal state of a person blinded by their own idols, making an abstract concept visible through a modern vocational lens.",

        "He went to see a friend of mine in the hospital who had gone through a windshield and had, like, 120 stitches in his face.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Predominantly 'telling'. The preacher explains theological and psychological mechanisms (the 'why') more than he evokes the experience of the 'what'."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in 'stewardship of language' as defined by McEntyre. There is a high degree of precision in distinguishing between 'sin in general' and 'sin in particular'. The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by defining terms like 'realize' and 'spiritual blindness' in ways that are accessible to a secular or skeptical audience. The language is economical and intellectually rigorous, avoiding the fluff often found in popular preaching. The nuances of the Pharisees' pride versus the man's simple testimony are handled with surgical precision. This clarity serves the 'Reformed aesthetics' of sober beauty—where the beauty lies in the truth being accurately and clearly articulated without unnecessary ornamentation.",
      "quotes": [
        "What does realize mean? It means it got real to me. I knew it abstractly... but I didn't see it.",
        "The deepest blindness is blindness to your own blindness.",

        "Exceptional clarity in defining theological concepts for a modern audience.",

        "Some sentences are structurally repetitive (e.g., 'If you live for... if you live for...')."

      "jargon_analysis": "Religious jargon is almost non-existent; where theological terms are used, they are immediately 'translated' into psychological or experiential categories."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The rhythm is that of a lecture or a high-level conversation rather than a poem or a song. It lacks the 'legato' of contemplative prose, favoring a 'staccato' of logical points and rhetorical questions. While this is effective for clarity and engagement in an urban setting, it lacks the aesthetic 'flow' that Grözinger or Cilliers might look for in a more 'poetic' sermon. The cadence is predictable: statement, explanation, example, rhetorical question. There are few instances of alliteration or parallelism that would make the language 'stick' based on sound alone. It is very much 'oral language'—designed to be heard and understood immediately—but it borders on 'paper language' in its heavy reliance on logical structure.",
      "quotes": [
        "The why question is always attached to suffering. 'Why me? Why them? Why, God?'",
        "If you live for your moral goodness, you’ll be blind about yourself. If you live for your children, you’ll be blind about them.",
        "He has to be torn if we’re going to be mended, and he has to be plunged into darkness."

        "Strong use of rhetorical questions to maintain engagement and rhythm.",

        "Clear, conversational tone that feels authentic and unforced."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Incorporate more varied sentence structures to avoid a monotonous 'teaching' cadence.",
        "Use more rhetorical figures (parallelism, chiasm) to increase memorability.",
        "Allow for moments of silence or slower 'legato' reflection between the dense logical points."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Oral language, but specifically 'didactic oral language'. It sounds like a teacher, not a poet."
    },
    "average_score_language": 6.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by intellectual precision and clarity, functioning as a sharp tool for 'reframing' reality. It avoids religious kitsch through a sober, analytical style. However, it lacks the sensory richness and musical cadence that would elevate it to a 'poetic' work of art. It prioritizes the 'logos' of the word—ensuring the hearer understands the mechanics of grace—over the 'pathos' of sensory evocation. It is a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic where the beauty is found in the clarity of the truth rather than the decoration of the delivery."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by upsetting the equilibrium with the 'why' of suffering, moves through the 'clash' of the Pharisees' blindness, and resolves in the man's worship. There is a palpable movement from the 'trouble' (suffering and blindness) to the 'grace' (Christ's darkness on the cross). The structure is not a static three-point list but a progressive argument that builds tension. The 'turning point' occurs when the preacher shifts from the external blindness of the man to the internal blindness of the 'brilliant' hearer. This creates a 'trap' for the listener that is only resolved through the gospel at the end.",
      "quotes": [
        "What we’re going to learn from the disciples... from the Pharisees... and then there’s the man himself.",
        "Jesus is saying two extremely interesting things about spiritual blindness. The first is a kind of reversal.",
        "He has to be torn if we’re going to be mended."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The 'reversal' in point two creates a strong dramaturgical shift that involves the hearer.",
        "The movement from physical to spiritual to Christological is logically and emotionally satisfying.",
        "The conclusion ties the 'darkness' of the blind man to the 'darkness' of the cross."

        "The transition between the three points could be more 'narrative' and less 'enumerative'.",

      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey that uses a three-part structure as a scaffold for a progressive argument."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. It perfectly exemplifies Cilliers' 'reframing'. The preacher takes a 1st-century healing and reframes it for a 21st-century 'meritocratic' context. He connects the disciples' theological questions to modern psychological biases and the Pharisees' pride to the 'brilliance' of New Yorkers. The synthesis between the biblical world and the contemporary world is organic; the text is not a 'springboard' but the 'lens' through which the modern world is scrutinized. It respects the 'strangeness' of the text (spitting, mud) while making its meaning piercingly relevant to a person applying for college or writing for the Times.",
      "quotes": [
        "There are brilliant people out there. In fact, a lot of them live in New York City.",
        "You needed a Department of Buildings back then, but they didn’t have it.",
        "When good writing was my only goal, I made the quality of my work the measure of my worth."

      "strengths": [
        "Masterful 'reframing' of the Pharisee as the 'successful/brilliant' modern person.",
        "Organic connection between the 'tower of Siloam' and modern safety/building concerns.",
        "The 'writing god' illustration perfectly bridges the gap between ancient idolatry and modern careerism."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could explore the 'Siloam' (Sent) meaning more deeply in relation to the modern 'sent-ness' of the believer.",
        "The 'Department of Buildings' joke is a bit 'kitsch'—it could be replaced with a deeper contextual insight.",
        "More focus on the 'Pool' as a space of transition."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing. It forces the hearer to see their 'success' as a potential 'blindness' and their 'suffering' as a 'space for grace'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is somewhat 'closed' in its logical rigor. While it is an 'open work of art' in the sense that it invites the hearer to diagnose their own blindness, the theological conclusions are very firmly 'sealed'. The preacher provides the answers to the 'why' of suffering and the 'how' of healing with great authority. However, it leaves room for the 'mystery' of suffering ('It’s mysterious... God has his purposes'), which prevents it from being a purely moralistic 'closed' system. The ending is an invitation to worship, which is an 'open' act, but the path to get there is a very specific, narrow logical corridor. It treats the hearer as a 'mature conversation partner' but one who is being led to a very specific conclusion.",
      "quotes": [
        "God has his purposes, but the point is God has work to do.",
        "I can actually test you right now. If you do not know what I’m talking about at all...",
        "Let it happen. Let us pray."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the mystery of suffering without offering 'cheap' answers.",
        "Invites the hearer to self-diagnosis rather than just imposing a label.",
        "The ending moves from 'explanation' to 'encounter' (worship)."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Leave more 'unresolved' questions at the end to stimulate further reflection.",
        "Reduce the 'I can test you' language, which can feel coercive rather than inviting.",
        "Allow the biblical narrative to speak more for itself without immediate 'translation'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A 'semi-open' work. It is polyvalent in its application but monovalent in its theological 'trap' and resolution."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic is strong, characterized by a sophisticated 'reframing' of the text for a modern audience. The sermon moves with a clear narrative arc from the problem of suffering to the solution of grace. It avoids the static 'three-point' trap by building a cumulative argument that culminates in a Christological 'turning point'. While the structure is logically 'tight' and occasionally 'closed', it creates a genuine 'space for grace' by honoring the mystery of suffering and the necessity of a 'rescue' from outside the self."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It explicitly attacks kitsch by rejecting the 'Sound of Music' theology ('I must have done something good'). It refuses to give 'happy ending' solutions to suffering, acknowledging that one may 'never see' or 'never understand' the purpose of their pain. The emotion at the end (the 'torn' Christ) is authentic because it is grounded in the 'trouble' of the cross rather than a superficial sentimentality. It avoids the 'pre-chewed' emotions of typical 'comfort' preaching by first demanding a painful self-honesty about blindness and pride.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'Sound of Music' quote is used as an example of kitsch to be rejected.",
      "The 'Department of Buildings' joke is a minor moment of 'pulpit kitsch'—a predictable 'relatability' move."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission that 'you may never see it... you may never understand' the purpose of suffering.",
      "The stark imagery of Christ being 'torn' and 'plunged into darkness' on the cross."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the rigorous rejection of 'merit-based' comfort; ensure that the 'worship' at the end doesn't become a 'technique' for sight but remains a response to grace."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'reversal' of human merit. By showing that the 'brilliant' are blind and the 'blind' see, the preacher creates a space where human effort is sidelined and God's 'work' becomes the only actor. The sermon avoids moralization by explicitly stating that 'cleaning up your life' actually makes you more blind. However, the space is slightly 'crowded' by the dense logical and psychological explanations. The 'mystery' of God is respected, but it is a mystery that is very clearly 'mapped' by the preacher.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained regarding suffering (the 'why' remains mysterious) but resolved quickly regarding the 'how' of salvation.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of God's providence is respected, but the mechanics of the human heart are 'explained' with perhaps too much certainty.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. The sermon is a sustained argument against moralization.",
    "recommendation": "Allow for more 'aesthetic pause'—moments where the mystery is simply sat with rather than explained."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high-quality example of 'Sober-Reformed' aesthetics combined with the 'New Homiletic' focus on movement and reframing. Its aesthetic power lies in its intellectual clarity and its ability to 'unmask' the hearer. It functions as an 'apologetic work of art', using logic and psychological insight to clear the ground for a sensory encounter with the cross. While it lacks the 'poetic' beauty of high-sensory language or rhythmic cadence, it achieves a 'beauty of truth' through its precise stewardship of language and its refusal to engage in religious kitsch. It is a sermon that 'shows' the gospel by 'reframing' the hearer's entire reality, moving them from a frame of 'merit' to a frame of 'grace'.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Intellectual precision and 'stewardship of language' that avoids jargon.",
      "Masterful 'reframing' of ancient text for a sophisticated urban context.",

      "Increase sensory 'imagery' to balance the heavy 'analytical' tone.",

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Analytical-Reframing (Reformed-Sober)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Anti-Kitsch) and Thomas Long (Witness/Form follows Text), though it leans more toward 'teaching' than 'performance'.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'intellectual seekers' and 'urban professionals' who value logic, psychological depth, and the 'unmasking' of cultural idols.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'cinematic' storytelling—spend three minutes solely in the 'darkness' of the blind man before explaining it.",
      "Use more 'legato' phrasing in the final movement to enhance the 'worshipful' atmosphere.",
      "Identify one 'living metaphor' and let it run through the entire sermon as a visual leitmotif."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically 'good' to 'strong' (6.8) performance of practical theology. It excels in the 'macro-aesthetics' of structure and reframing, creating a compelling journey for the modern mind. Its 'micro-aesthetics' are functional and precise but lack the poetic 'surplus' that would make it a model of homiletic beauty. It is a highly effective 'event' of truth-telling that opens a clear, if intellectually demanding, space for grace."
