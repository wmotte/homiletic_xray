    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a masterful piece of poetic homiletics that effectively uses the Nurturing Parent ego state to address existential dread. However, it regresses into a Critical Parent mode by using God's immutability as a tool for moral surveillance. It reinforces a 'Helpless Child' position in the listener, emphasizing decay and inability over the Adult's capacity for present-moment agency.",

      "High level of empathy and Nurturing Parent support for those grieving.",
      "Effective use of Adult metaphors (navigation) to explain complex concepts."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Heavy reliance on 'Ain't It Awful' creates a depressive atmosphere.",
      "The shift to Critical Parent ('God frowns') feels like a psychological trap after the initial comfort."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to move from 'We are helpless' (Victim) to 'How do we respond today?' (Adult). Reduce the use of nostalgic triggers that keep the listener in a regressed Child state."
