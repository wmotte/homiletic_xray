    "summary": "The sermon is intellectually stimulating and addresses 'Adult' concerns (history, economy). However, it relies heavily on a Critical Parent voice to drive change. By labeling the listener's past (and their parents) as 'wrong,' it risks triggering a defensive Adapted Child response rather than authentic Free Child transformation. The 'grace' mentioned feels more like a theological requirement than a felt reality.",

      "The 'your mother was wrong' comment is a high-risk CP transaction that can cause unnecessary trauma/resistance.",
      "The list of 'Go further' imperatives can feel like a new 'Law' replacing the old 'Purity Codes'."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Shift from the imperative 'Go further!' (Parent) to an interrogative 'Where is the Spirit inviting you?' (Adult). This honors the listener's autonomy and reduces the 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' dynamic."
