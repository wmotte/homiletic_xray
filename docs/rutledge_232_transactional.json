It avoids the common trap of the Critical Parent (shaming the listener for not being 'forgiving enough') and instead uses the Adult ego state to validate the complexity of human suffering. By acknowledging that 'denial is bad for everybody,' the preacher aligns theological truth with psychological reality. The sermon promotes autonomy by removing the burden of 'producing' forgiveness and placing the responsibility for 'rectification' on the Divine, thereby freeing the listener from the Drama Triangle.",
