    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is rhetorically powerful but psychologically regressive. It relies on devaluing others ('The Beautiful People') to create a sense of belonging for the 'in-group.' By casting the world as 'repulsive' and the listener as a 'victim' or 'sheep,' it reinforces a Parent-Child dynamic that promotes dependency rather than spiritual maturity (Adult). The second half offers high-quality Nurturing Parent comfort, but it remains within the Drama Triangle.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation's Adult ego. Instead of saying 'we cannot make ourselves beautiful' (Child helplessness), explore how the 'glory' of God empowers the Adult to live with integrity in a complex world without needing to devalue others to feel 'beautiful'."
