    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily through biblical exposition and personal anecdotes. The preacher effectively 'paints' the scene of the Passion to illustrate the 'Lamb of God' metaphor, moving from abstract theology to sensory details like the 'open back' and the 'narrow streets of Jerusalem'. However, the imagery is often traditional and lacks original metaphorical 'reframing' in the sense of Cilliers. The personal story of meeting his wife provides a relatable image of 'encounter', but it remains somewhat separate from the theological imagery of the Lamb. The 'show, don't tell' principle is applied during the Golgotha section, but elsewhere the sermon relies on 'telling' the meaning of Greek words (e.g., 'airein').",

    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The language is accessible and pastoral but relies heavily on 'Canaanite' religious jargon ('zondenlast', 'verzoening', 'vrucht dragen', 'beschaamd het hoofd buigen'). While these terms are familiar to the target audience, they lack the 'stewardship of language' McEntyre advocates for—precision that breaks through cliché. The word choice is somewhat repetitive, frequently using 'gemeente' and 'zie' without varying the rhetorical impact. There is a tendency toward generalization ('we all have sins') rather than nuanced human experience. However, the explanation of the Moody story shows a careful narrative hand.",
      "quotes": [
        "Dan buig je toch beschaamd je hoofd? En dan vlucht je toch tot dat Lam van God...",
        "Nee, geen uiterlijke opknapbeurt. Niet iets van de buitenkant, maar innerlijk, van binnen.",

      "jargon_analysis": "High presence of traditional Reformed jargon; it functions as a 'shibboleth' for the in-group but lacks aesthetic freshness."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a natural, conversational flow. The preacher uses rhetorical repetition effectively, particularly the 'Zie...' (Behold) and 'Kom en zie' (Come and see) motifs, which create a rhythmic cadence. The variation between the narrative sections (Moody, personal story) and the hortatory sections provides a decent tempo. However, the sentence structure is often monotonous, following a standard subject-verb-object pattern without much poetic variation or use of alliteration/assonance. It is clearly 'oral language', which is a strength, but it lacks the 'musical' depth of a truly poetic sermon.",
      "quotes": [
        "Kom. Kom in beweging. Blijf niet zitten waar je zit, maar sta op en open je hart en kom naar Mij toe.",
        "Zie Hem daar gebukt gaan... Zie Hem daar hangen... Zie het Lam van God.",

        "Strong use of anaphora ('Zie...') to build rhetorical intensity.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 5.67,
    "summary_language": "The language is pastorally warm and accessible but aesthetically conservative. It relies on traditional Reformed vocabulary which, while comforting to the 'in-group', borders on cliché. The imagery is strongest when describing the Passion, successfully 'showing' the suffering of Christ. However, the lack of linguistic precision and the reliance on religious jargon prevent the sermon from achieving a high poetic score. It functions well as a vehicle for a message but does not stand as a 'work of art' in its own right."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear, albeit traditional, narrative arc. It begins with a personal 'hook' (the meeting with his wife), moves into the biblical narrative of John the Baptist, transitions to the 'trouble' (the weight of sin), and finds its 'grace' in the invitation of Jesus. The use of the Moody story serves as a secondary climax to illustrate the application. However, the 'upsetting of the equilibrium' is mild; the tension is never truly uncomfortable. The structure is more of a 'string of stories' than a single, tight homiletical plot. The movement from 'seeing' to 'following' to 'inviting' provides a logical progression.",
      "quotes": [
        "Die ontmoeting ben ik nooit vergeten. En die heeft mijn leven drastisch veranderd.",
        "Stel dat Jezus vanmorgen hier in de Broederkerk is... Wat zou je dan zeggen?",
        "En zo leidde Andreas zijn broer Petrus tot Jezus."

        "The personal opening effectively establishes the theme of 'life-changing encounters'.",
        "The 'Moody' story is well-placed to provide a concrete example of the sermon's goal.",
        "Clear transitions between the biblical 'then' and the congregational 'now'."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Increase the 'homiletical tension' by exploring the resistance to following Jesus more deeply.",
        "Tighten the connection between the three main stories (Personal, Biblical, Moody) into a more singular arc.",

      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey through stories, though slightly fragmented by the multiple anecdotes."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher does a commendable job of 'reframing' the biblical text within the contemporary life of the congregation. By placing Jesus 'in the Broederkerk' and asking what the hearer would say to Him, the preacher bridges the historical gap. The connection between Andreas's personal invitation and modern 'friendship evangelism' is a successful integration of context. The 'reframing' occurs when the preacher takes the mundane (a shoe store, a youth magazine) and shows God's providence within it. However, the 'strangeness' of the biblical world is quickly domesticated into familiar pietistic categories.",
      "quotes": [
        "En zo komt deze Jezus vanmorgen hier langs, ook in de Broederkerk.",
        "Vriendschapsevangelisatie, dat is een hele [plaatsnaam]volle manier om anderen tot Jezus te leiden.",
        "Vind je lezen moeilijk? Je kunt overal, is die Bijbel ingelezen, dus via een podcast..."

      "strengths": [
        "Strong 'actualization' of the text for different demographics (teenagers, seekers).",
        "The 'Broederkerk' thought experiment creates a vivid sense of 'hic et nunc' (here and now).",
        "Practical advice (podcasts) shows awareness of modern context."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Allow the biblical text to remain 'strange' for a moment longer before applying it, to increase the impact of the reframing.",
        "Explore the 'context' of modern doubt more deeply than just 'not having a house' or 'health'.",
        "Connect the 'Lamb of God' imagery more specifically to modern social or personal 'burdens'."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes, the sermon successfully frames the biblical 'meeting' as a present-day possibility."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward a 'closed' work of art. While it uses questions ('What do you seek?'), it often provides the answers immediately in traditional dogmatic terms. The 'invitation' is warm, but the path is strictly defined through the lens of Reformed piety (sin-grace-gratitude). There is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or for a hearer who might struggle with the 'Lamb' metaphor. The ending is an imperative ('Do not play hide and seek'), which closes the 'open space' that Ciska Stark advocates for. It is a monovalent call to a specific type of faith experience.",
      "quotes": [
        "Dan buig je toch beschaamd je hoofd?",
        "De gemeente zal daar zo'n poosje stil zijn... [followed by immediate interpretation]",
        "Speel dan niet lang een verstoppertje. Blijf niet zitten waar je zit..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The moment of silence in the middle of the sermon is a rare and excellent 'open' liturgical moment.",
        "The invitation 'Come and see' is inherently more open than 'Believe this doctrine'.",
        "The use of the Moody story allows the hearer to 'see' themselves in the narrative."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Leave the questions hanging longer without providing the 'correct' religious answer immediately.",
        "Acknowledge the difficulty of 'seeing' Jesus in a secular age more honestly.",
        "End with an invitation or a blessing rather than a moralizing command ('Speel niet...')."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent; the hearer is guided toward a predetermined emotional and theological response."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon's structure is effective and narrative-driven, making it highly engaging for a listener. It successfully bridges the gap between the biblical world and the local context of the 'Broederkerk'. However, it suffers from a lack of dramaturgical tension and a tendency to close the 'open space' of the text with traditional moralizing and dogmatic shortcuts. It is a well-constructed 'path' for the hearer, but the destination is perhaps too predictable to be truly aesthetically transformative."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 5,
    "analysis": "The sermon teeters on the edge of religious kitsch. The personal anecdote about meeting his wife, while charming, risks being 'sentimental' rather than 'authentic' in a theological sense (the 'happy ending' trope). The language of 'beschaamd het hoofd buigen' and 'vluchten tot het Lam' are clichés that can function as kitsch—pre-packaged emotions that bypass real struggle. However, the story of the verlegen (shy) Sunday school teacher Kimball provides a moment of authentic depth, as it highlights weakness and 'stuttering' rather than polished religious success. The Passion description is vivid but borders on the 'melodramatic' kitsch of traditional pietism.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'perfect' family photo on the bank leading to a 'miracle' meeting the next day.",
      "The immediate resolution of the 'sin' problem through standard liturgical phrases."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of Kimball 'trembling with nerves' before entering the shoe store.",
      "The honest admission that 'I don't remember what I said... it was a weak call'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Avoid the 'happily ever after' framing of providence; instead, highlight the 'inter-esse' (the tension) between the encounter and the reality of a broken world."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened through the central motif of 'invitation' ('Kom en zie'). By emphasizing that Jesus takes the initiative and 'looks at' Petrus, the preacher maintains the 'vertical' dimension of grace. However, the space is partially closed by the heavy moralizing in the application ('you must not stay seated', 'open your Bible'). The 'mystery' of the Lamb is explained away through Greek word studies rather than being allowed to stand as a holy mystery. The sermon creates a 'Space for Grace' primarily in its tone of warmth and welcome, but less so in its theological structure.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are mostly resolved quickly through the 'it is volbracht' (it is finished) formula.",
    "mystery_respected": "Moderate; the preacher tries to make the mystery 'understandable' rather than 'perceivable'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace is the foundation, but moralization ('do this', 'read that') dominates the conclusion.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'silence' and the 'mystery' of Christ's presence to speak for themselves without over-explaining the mechanics of salvation."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 5.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a solid example of 'Sober-Reformed' homiletics with a strong narrative heart. Its aesthetic quality lies in its accessibility and the warmth of its 'invitational' tone. The preacher successfully uses the 'New Homiletic' technique of 'showing' during the Passion narrative and employs a 'homiletical plot' by weaving personal and historical stories into the biblical text. However, from the perspective of the 'aesthetic turn', the sermon is hampered by its reliance on traditional religious jargon and a 'closed' structure that leaves little room for the hearer's own interpretive struggle. It prioritizes 'consolatio' (consolation) and 'exhortatio' (exhortation) over the 'opera aperta' (open work). The imagery is effective but traditional, lacking the 'reframing' power that would make the gospel appear 'strange' and new. It is a 'safe' sermon that confirms the existing frames of the hearer rather than radically expanding them.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Narrative engagement through well-told anecdotes (Personal, Moody).",
      "Strong actualization, making the biblical encounter feel present in the 'Broederkerk'.",
      "Effective use of the 'Zie/Behold' motif to create a visual focus on Christ."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Linguistic stewardship: Replace 'Canaanite' clichés with fresh, precise language.",
      "Dramaturgical tension: Allow the 'trouble' or 'resistance' to be more palpable before offering the solution.",
      "Openness: Trust the 'Space for Grace' by ending with an invitation rather than a series of imperatives."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Pietistic: Focused on personal encounter, story-telling, and heart-felt response within a traditional framework.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Four Pages' model of Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Trouble/Grace) and the narrative approach of Kees van Dusseldorp.",
    "audience_analysis": "Most appealing to traditional Reformed churchgoers who find comfort in familiar imagery and a warm, personal pastoral tone.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a 'reframing' metaphor that doesn't come from the traditional religious lexicon.",
      "Read the sermon aloud to identify and cut 'filler' phrases that weaken the musicality.",
      "Try an 'open ending' that leaves the congregation with a question rather than a command."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is aesthetically 'sufficient' (6/10) in its ability to communicate a message through story and image. It avoids the worst traps of kitsch by including moments of human weakness (Kimball), but it does not reach the level of 'excellent' (8+) because it remains too tied to predictable linguistic and theological patterns. It functions as a clear 'witness' (Long) but lacks the 'poetic power' (Grözinger) to truly startle the hearer into a new perception of reality. It is a sermon that 'serves' the congregation well but does not 'challenge' the aesthetic or spiritual imagination."
