    "psychological_health_score": 2,
    "summary": "This sermon is a classic example of 'Guilt-Gore-Grace' homiletics. It functions primarily through a Critical Parent to Adapted Child transaction. By forcing the listener to visualize their 'most sinful' acts alongside the graphic torture of a 'helpless' victim, it creates a psychological bind. The preacher suppresses the Adult ego by dismissing objective inquiry in favor of emotional saturation. The result is a 'payoff' of relief that is actually a trauma-bond to the religious institution rather than authentic spiritual growth.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Shift from 'For you!' (accusatory) to Adult-Adult reflection on the nature of suffering. Reduce the use of 'must' and 'vile' to allow the listener to arrive at their own moral conclusions without coercion."
