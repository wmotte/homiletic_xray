        "score": 8,
        "score_explanation": "High score due to the absence of moralistic 'shaming.' The preacher uses 'we' rather than 'you' when discussing failure.",
        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "Coercion is replaced by logical necessity. Instead of 'You must change,' the preacher argues 'If you have this power, why wouldn't you change?'",

        "presence_of_adaptation": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher explicitly rejects the 'one-size-fits-all' conversion experience, which reduces the pressure on the listener to 'adapt' to a specific emotional mold.",

    "risk_explanation": "A minor risk of a 'Parent -> Child' transaction exists when the preacher defines who is and isn't a 'Christian,' though this is framed as a logical definition rather than a personal attack."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely game-free. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, treating the listener as a rational agent capable of self-reflection. By validating diverse emotional experiences (the three conversion stories), it prevents the 'Adapted Child' response of forced piety. The use of the Drama Triangle is avoided by placing the 'Hero' role on the theological figure of Christ rather than the preacher, thus fostering a healthy, non-dependent relationship between the pulpit and the pew.",
    "strengths": [
      "Validation of diverse psychological temperaments.",
      "Strong Adult-level engagement with text and reality.",
      "Inclusion of the self (preacher) in human limitation."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'if you haven't experienced new birth, you're not a Christian' line is a brief flash of Critical Parent that could trigger 'Adapted Child' anxiety in seekers."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'we' to maintain the Adult-Adult horizontal plane. Ensure that the 'imperishable hope' doesn't become a 'Gimmick' for bypassing real-world grief (though this sermon balances that well)."
