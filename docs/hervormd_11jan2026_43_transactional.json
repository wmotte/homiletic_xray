By defining human nature as inherently 'hating' and 'bad,' it risks damaging the listener's self-esteem and agency. The use of the 'NIGYSOB' game effectively invalidates any positive human behavior, creating a state of learned helplessness. While theologically consistent with strict Reformed tradition, the psychological impact is one of shame-induction and total dependency on an external 'Rescuer' without fostering Adult-level responsibility.",
