    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon employs strong, visceral imagery, particularly when describing the 'stark ugliness of death.' The preacher avoids the 'kitsch' of springtime metaphors initially, opting for the 'smell of death' and the 'horrible indignity' of the corpse. This aligns with Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' by making the enemy of death a tangible 'Power.' However, the later sections rely heavily on biblical and hymnographic imagery (battle scenes, white horses) which, while powerful, are less 'original' metaphors and more traditional tropes. The contrast between the 'scruffy fishermen' and the 'lightning' of the angel creates a cinematic tension. The imagery of the 'citadel of Death' being 'stormed' provides a concrete spatial dimension to the theological concept of Atonement.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise, particularly in its critique of 'Canaanite' liberal jargon. The preacher meticulously deconstructs phrases like 'enduring symbols of ultimate truth,' exposing them as vague and powerless. This demonstrates McEntyre's 'stewardship of language' by refusing to let words be used sloppily. The distinction between 'sentiment' and 'miracle' is handled with surgical precision. The preacher uses clear, economical sentences to build an argument. There is a sophisticated awareness of syntax (e.g., noting that God is the 'acting subject' of the sentence), which elevates the sermon from mere exhortation to a high-level linguistic performance.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a distinct oral cadence, utilizing rhetorical questions and staccato sentences to create urgency. The repetition of 'I know...' creates a rhythmic build-up (anaphora) that leads to the 'But I also know...' turning point. There is a clear 'legato' in the reflective sections about death, followed by a 'fortissimo' of apocalyptic quotes. The use of the Easter greeting as a bookend provides a musical 'da capo' structure. However, the long block-quotes from Revelation at the end disrupt the preacher's own rhythmic flow, shifting from a personal voice to a declamatory one that may feel 'heavy' in a live performance.",

    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by 'sober beauty' and intellectual rigor. It avoids the 'kitsch' of sentimental Easter tropes by grounding the imagery in the harsh reality of death. The preacher acts as a 'steward of the word,' carefully dissecting and rejecting vague religious abstractions. While the imagery is largely traditional (battle/apocalypse), it is delivered with a rhythmic precision that makes the 'impossible' message feel urgent. The micro-aesthetics are defined by a move from the 'smell of death' to the 'lightning' of the Resurrection, maintaining a high level of linguistic care throughout."

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a masterful 'Lowry-esque' plot. It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' by questioning the congregation's own belief. It then moves into the 'itch'—the embarrassment of modern faith and the inadequacy of 'wishy-washy' sermons. The tension peaks in the description of the 'utter hopelessness' of the disciples. The turning point (the 'aha!' moment) is not a human realization, but the divine 'event' of the earthquake and the angel. The movement from 'human possibility' to 'God's acting subject' provides a clear dramaturgical progression. The energy is sustained until the final 'Hallelujah,' though the climax is perhaps a bit over-extended by the multiple scripture readings.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a prime example of Cilliers' 'reframing.' The preacher takes the 'urbane' context of the listeners and reframes it not as 'sophistication' but as 'timidity' and 'embarrassment.' The biblical text is not 'smoothed over'; its 'strangeness' (earthquakes, lightning, angels) is highlighted as the only thing powerful enough to address the 'stark ugliness' of a hit-and-run death. The synthesis is organic: the 'snowy New England day' is integrated into the liturgical 'Benedicite' prayer at the end. The preacher respects the 'then' of the scruffy fishermen while making it a 'now' for the skeptical Ph.D. student.",
      "quotes": [
        "I asked him afterward why he had been so timid, and he murmured something about the congregation being 'very skeptical and urbane.'",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Aesthetically, the sermon is more 'closed' than Stark’s 'Opera Aperta' might suggest. It is a powerful 'Witness' (Long) that leaves little room for alternative interpretations. The preacher is quite directive: 'I confess that it is not enough for me. More important, such reflections fall far short of the New Testament message.' While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (the hit-and-run, the smell of death), it resolves these tensions very firmly with the 'victory' of the Resurrection. It is 'monovalent' in its insistence on the literal/divine act. However, it is 'open' in the sense that it invites the hearer into a 'mystery' that 'cannot be proved,' leaving the final 'leap of faith' to the listener.",
      "quotes": [
        "I know it isn't possible as we understand possibility. But I also know that this is a message that would explain everything.",

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Relatively closed/monovalent; it is a 'kerygmatic' proclamation that demands a 'yes' or 'no' response."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon exhibits a strong, dynamic narrative arc that moves from the 'itch' of modern skepticism to the 'climax' of divine intervention. It excels in 'reframing' the contemporary context through the 'strangeness' of the biblical text. While the structure is somewhat 'closed' due to its strong kerygmatic stance, it maintains aesthetic depth by refusing to resolve the 'impossibility' of the message through logic, instead pointing to 'stupefied awe.' The integration of local context (the weather, the cemetery) with cosmic battle imagery creates a compelling macro-aesthetic movement."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is a masterclass in anti-kitsch. It explicitly attacks 'religious kitsch'—the 'wishy-washy sentiments about springtime,' the 'enduring symbols,' and the 'nature-bound ideas' of afterlife. The preacher refuses to offer 'immediate comfort' without first acknowledging the 'horrible indignity' of death. By contrasting the 'smell of death' with the 'lightning' of the angel, the sermon avoids the 'pre-chewed emotions' of typical Easter messages. It sustains the 'pain of suffering' (the hit-and-run husband) and refuses to give it a 'happy ending' other than the 'impossible' hope of the Resurrection. It is authentic because it admits the 'shame' and 'timidity' of the believer.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'springtime in the heart' sentiments the preacher explicitly rejects.",
      "The 'enduring symbols of ultimate truth' jargon."

      "The admission of the preacher's own 'goosebumps' and the 'shame' felt by modern Christians."

    "recommendation": "To maintain this level of authenticity, ensure that the 'battle imagery' at the end doesn't become its own kind of 'theological kitsch' by being too detached from the 'smell of death' established earlier."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace precisely by closing off the 'space for human effort.' By arguing that the disciples could not 'pull themselves together,' the preacher creates a vacuum that only God's grace can fill. Cilliers' 'reframing' is evident: the tomb is not a place of human remembrance but a site of divine 'inter-esse.' The 'mystery' of the resurrection is respected because it is presented as 'beyond possibility.' However, the high-intensity 'battle' language at the end risks 'crowding' the space with dogmatic certainty, though the preacher's admission that it 'cannot be proved' keeps the door of grace slightly ajar for the skeptic.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'urbane skepticism' and 'divine earthquake' is sustained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, the 'how' of the resurrection is left in the 'night' before the women arrived.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; there is almost no moralizing ('we must'), only proclamation ('God has').",

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.7,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'Kerygmatic-Apocalyptic' preaching. It achieves high aesthetic quality not through 'beautifying' the message, but through the 'beauty of simplicity' and the 'power of metaphor' (Cilliers). Its primary strength lies in its 'stewardship of language,' where it aggressively clears away religious kitsch to make room for the 'strangeness' of the Gospel. The poetics are grounded in sensory reality (the smell of death, the cold of New England) which provides a necessary 'weight' to the cosmic battle imagery used later. Dramaturgically, it is a 'dynamic journey' that successfully reframes the listener's skepticism as a participation in the disciples' own initial hopelessness. While it leans towards a 'closed' work of art in its dogmatic intensity, it remains aesthetically 'open' by grounding its claims in 'stupefied awe' rather than logical proof. It is a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that draws attention not to the preacher's brilliance, but to the 'acting subject' of the text: God.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional 'anti-kitsch' stance that honors the reality of death.",

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Kerygmatic-Apocalyptic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Preacher as Witness' of Thomas Long.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'urbane' skeptics who are tired of sentimentality and seek a 'hard' intellectual and spiritual challenge.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'open' endings to allow the 'polyvalence' of the text to resonate longer.",
      "Integrate the 'battle' metaphors more deeply into the contemporary stories used.",
      "Reduce the length of scripture block-quotes to maintain the preacher's unique rhythmic voice."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically 'excellent' sermon (7.7) that serves as a model for how to preach the Resurrection in a secular age without resorting to kitsch. It demonstrates that the 'aesthetic turn' is not about making the message 'pretty,' but about making the 'impossible' truth of the Gospel 'perceivable' through precise language and dramatic structure. It successfully creates a 'Space for Grace' by highlighting the limits of human possibility."
