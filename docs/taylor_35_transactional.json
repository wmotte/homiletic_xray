    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of Nurturing Parent preaching. While it provides significant emotional comfort and utilizes a high-level Adult opening (Einstein), it ultimately reinforces a 'Helpful/Helpless' dynamic. By framing spiritual growth as something that only happens when one is 'knocked down,' it risks romanticizing depression and passivity. The use of the word 'fix' (drug metaphor) explicitly points to a dependency model rather than a growth model.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to move from 'I have a word for you' (Parent) to 'Let us examine how we can use our past experiences' (Adult). Encourage the 'Free Child's' joy without requiring the 'Adapted Child's' total defeat first."
