    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a strong seasonal metaphor that connects to the universal human experience of time passing. It effectively uses the New Year context to ground the hearer in a recognizable moment. However, it relies more on poetic archetypes (spring, summer, autumn, winter) than on specific, gritty life-situations of the modern hearer, which keeps the experience somewhat generalized.",

        "A year is gone! A year has come!",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher spends significant time observing the human tendency to avoid the reality of death. There is a clear attempt to analyze the 'why' behind human behavior—specifically the 'defense phrases' and 'smart-alecky evasions.' It falls short of a 7 because it tends to scold the behavior rather than deeply exploring the psychological or cultural roots of this avoidance.",
      "quotes": [
        "Maybe, maybe we refuse to consider that we are so very temporary in the earth because most of us do not have a faith deep enough...",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The theological core is the transition from human frailty to God's eternity. The 'big idea' is the shift of hope from the temporal to the eternal. While it quotes several scriptures, the exegesis of Psalm 39 is relatively thin, serving more as a springboard for the preacher's own poetic reflections than a rigorous unfolding of the text's logic.",

    "overall_kolb_score": 6.2,
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of visionary, poetic preaching that effectively utilizes the 'Concrete Experience' of the New Year to address the 'Reflective Observation' of human mortality. It succeeds in creating a somber, reflective atmosphere that forces the hearer to confront the 'vain shadow' of material life. However, it falls short in 'Active Experimentation.' While it clearly identifies God as the source of hope (Abstract Conceptualization), it provides almost no concrete guidance on how a hearer should practically reorient their life, finances, or relationships in light of this hope. The language is elevated and metaphorical, which serves the 'Diverging' learner well but may leave the 'Converging' learner searching for practical relevance. The Christological turn at the end is appropriate but feels somewhat like a standard 'homiletical addition' rather than a fully integrated solution to the specific 'sorrow' and 'silence' mentioned in the introduction.",

      "Balance the 'Artist' role with the 'Guide/Coach' role.",
      "Use more specific, less archetypal 'Concrete Experiences' from modern life."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a well-crafted visionary piece that excels in the first half of Kolb's cycle. It successfully moves the hearer from the 'feeling' of time passing to a 'reflection' on the futility of materialism and a 'conceptualization' of God as the only stable hope. Its primary diagnosis is a lack of practical application; it is a sermon of 'atmosphere' and 'truth' that lacks 'action.' For a New Year's sermon, it provides the necessary solemnity but misses the opportunity to equip the congregation with specific spiritual habits for the year ahead. The priority for improvement is the development of the Pragmatic/Active Experimentation quadrant."
