    "sermon_start_end": "On Palm Sunday every year, Christians around the world think about what it means that Jesus is King. On Palm Sunday, Jesus rode into Jerusalem one week before he died, and he received the acclaim of the crowd, who waved palms and said, “Hosanna” and “Blessed is the King” [...] Jesus is the divine and human King. Jesus is the Mighty God, but he’s at the same time the Wonderful Counselor. He’s the great King. He’s the great Judge, but he’s the Judge who became judged. He was the sacrifice for our sins."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon focuses specifically on Psalm 110. It avoids generalities by highlighting the unique tension within this specific text—the combination of kingly and priestly offices—which is rare in the Old Testament canon.",
      "quotes": [
        "Instead, you just had Psalm 110 read to you. Psalm 110 is unbelievably rich.",
        "The fundamental question in making the sermon is: what is in this Bible passage that you can find NOWHERE else in the Bible?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "While the sermon identifies the uniqueness of the text, it occasionally drifts into a general explanation of the 'Gospel' rather than sticking strictly to the unique imagery of the 'brook' or the 'footstool' in the latter half."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates knowledge of the historical context regarding the separation of offices in Israel and the figure of Melchizedek. However, the exegesis is heavily filtered through New Testament reception rather than the Hebrew context itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "In Israel, kings were not priests, and priests were not kings.",
        "Melchizedek was a strange person who... was a priest and a king. Before Israel was founded, in Genesis 14..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the linguistic analysis of the Hebrew 'Adonai' vs 'YHWH' beyond the surface level to ground the 'divine/human' claim more firmly in the text's original difficulty."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application targets the 'modern New Yorker' or 'American' mindset, specifically the desire for an impersonal God. While culturally relevant, it remains somewhat broad and psychological rather than socially or politically concrete.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus says things that just make New Yorkers’ skin crawl.",
        "Most Americans want to have some kind of idea of God, but they don’t want a God like this."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the 'individual's view of God' to more concrete applications in the realms of ethics, politics, or specific congregational life as Dekker suggests."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon successfully avoids the 'lecture-then-moral' structure. It moves back and forth between the text's claims and the hearer's resistance, drawing the hearer into the logic of the Psalm.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus used this psalm to get into the face of his audience, but if you don’t mind, I’d like to use Psalm 110 to get into your face."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'application' sections don't become independent theological essays that lose sight of the specific verses of Psalm 110."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The three parts are present. Misery is defined as the 'box' we put God in; redemption is the cross; gratitude is becoming 'kings and priests.' However, the 'misery' is more intellectual/psychological than a deep existential 'misery before God.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The essence of sin is you putting yourself where only God deserves to be.",
        "The gospel humbles you by saying, 'You are a sinner. You need this.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Sharpen the 'misery' aspect; it feels slightly 'soft' in Dekker’s terms, focusing on 'putting God in a box' rather than the total lostness of man."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on the 'two ways' by mentioning the 'day of wrath' and the 'ultimate possibilities' of surrender vs. resistance, but it softens the blow by focusing on 'beauty' rather than the 'destruction' mentioned in Dekker's thesis 6.",
      "quotes": [
        "He will crush kings on the day of his wrath... heaping up the dead.",
        "If you’re going to deal with me at all... you have to surrender to me."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the reality of being 'lost' more directly. The sermon tends to pivot quickly to grace without dwelling on the gravity of the 'broad way'."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "The sermon is strongly Christocentric. Christ is the telos, and the doctrine of the two natures is central to the argument. Grace is presented as the only way to reconcile God's justice and love.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus Christ is the one to whom all of them point, and he supersedes them.",
        "It’s only as we understand what Jesus Christ did for us in the gospel that all the goodness of God passes in front of us."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Maintain the tension of the 'Judge' (King) more firmly so that grace doesn't become a 'general truth' but remains a 'concrete' rescue from the specific judgment in the text."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At approximately 3,300 words, the sermon provides the 'breadth' Miskotte and Dekker require for 'depth.' It allows for complex theological moves.",
      "quotes": [
        "There’s actually so much to tell you about... that I despair of getting it all in, but let’s go."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "None on length; the duration is adequate for the substantive weight attempted."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of Christocentric preaching that takes the specific biblical text seriously. It falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily in its tendency toward psychological application rather than concrete social/ethical application, and in its slightly 'soft' treatment of the 'two ways' (the reality of being lost). It successfully avoids being a general speech about 'kingship' by tethering the argument to the unique priest-king tension of Psalm 110.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strict adherence to the specific logic of the chosen pericope (Thesis 1).",
      "Effective interwoveness of exposition and application (Thesis 4).",
      "Clear Christological focus grounded in the two-natures doctrine (Thesis 7)."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Application remains largely in the realm of personal psychology/spirituality (Thesis 3).",
      "The 'seriousness of being lost' is present but secondary to the 'beauty of Christ' (Thesis 6).",
      "Exegesis relies heavily on systematic theology rather than original historical-linguistic depth (Thesis 2)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It functions as an actualization of the Word, though it would benefit from a more 'concrete' and less 'psychological' application to the zeitgeist."
