    "sermon_start_end": "When someone has achieved something noteworthy, one of the first questions put to that person inquires how the success was attained. When a man or a woman reaches an unusually advanced age, reporters want to know, \"How did you live to be a hundred or a hundred and five?\" [...] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lorp for ever. (Psalm 23)",
    "notes": "The sermon utilizes a narrative-homiletical approach, moving from human curiosity about 'success' to the theological reality of God's presence."

  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The 'Sache' (matter) of the sermon is the practice of the presence of God as the source of spiritual stability. The preacher correctly identifies the exegetical core of Psalm 16:8. However, the theological depth remains somewhat horizontal. While referencing James Sanders and C.H. Dodd, the sermon leans heavily on the 'how-to' of spiritual life rather than a robust dogmatic exploration of the 'Living Christ' (Barth). The factual content is highly comprehensible but lacks a sharp analytical edge regarding the nature of revelation itself. It treats the Bible as a 'mirror'—a valid homiletical move—but risks reducing the Word to a psychological tool for self-improvement rather than an encounter with the Wholly Other.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have set the Lorp always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.",
        "The Bible is a mirror in which we may see ourselves.",

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The language is accessible, and the metaphors (old age, business success) are relatable to a general congregation."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a nostalgic yet critical perspective on church tradition (e.g., the corncob pipe anecdote). There is a clear sense of pastoral maturity and a 'merry twinkle' in the delivery. The 'I' is used primarily as a bridge to the 'We', showing a diaconal quality where personal observations serve the message. However, there is a slight 'leak' of frustration regarding the lack of growth in the congregation ('Christians who have not grown in ten, twenty, thirty... years'). This reveals a preacher who feels the weight of stagnant congregational life, moving from a gentle storyteller to a stern monitor of spiritual progress.",
      "quotes": [
        "In my childhood I knew many matriarchs... who smoked their corncob pipes without any hint of criticism.",
        "I am not out to prove anything, but this was an interesting difference made by our elders.",
        "Too many of us are still in the same old patterns we were in twenty or thirty years ago."

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive-Compulsive mix. The preacher seeks harmony and connection (Depressive) through shared stories but exhibits Compulsive traits in the demand for spiritual order, growth, and 'correctness' in prayer life.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is largely subservient, though the preacher's own standards for 'spiritual success' occasionally overshadow the text's own rhythm.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is initially solidary ('We want to know...'), but shifts into a paternalistic 'Teaching' mode in the middle section. The preacher positions himself as the one who diagnoses the congregation's 'moral flabbiness.' There is significant 'relationship noise' when the preacher accuses the congregation of 'slouching down in some halfway house of the spirit.' While intended as a 'healing disruption,' it risks being heard as a 'You-message' of condemnation from a position of superiority, potentially repelling the listener who feels they are doing their best in difficult circumstances.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is a mockery of the Lord Jesus Christ... for us to slouch down in some halfway house of the spirit.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward 'Anspruch' (Demand). The appeal is for spiritual growth, more prayer, and more holiness. While theologically sound in intent, the 'Red Side' dominates the 'Blue Side' of Gospel promise. The preacher demands 'agony of prayer' and 'godliness,' but the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is often presented as the *result* of the human action of 'setting the Lord before us' rather than the *cause* of it. This creates a risk of moralism where the listener leaves with a 'to-do' list rather than the 'rest' of faith (Immink). The Gospel is framed as a reward for 'Spiritual Success' rather than a gift for the spiritually bankrupt.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are called to be more prayerful than we are, more holy than we are.",

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The balance is skewed toward Anspruch. The promise (Zuspruch) is conditional upon the human effort of 'setting the Lord before us'.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "High. The emphasis on 'achieving' and 'pursuing' spiritual heights can lead to a works-righteousness mindset.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 5.8,
    "summary": "The sermon 'Spiritual Success' is a classic example of a homiletical move from human experience to divine demand. While it begins with an engaging, narrative 'Green' side that builds rapport, it quickly transitions into a dominant 'Red' side. Theologically, it flirts with a Barthian 'No' to human self-satisfaction but fails to provide the corresponding 'Yes' of Grace that is independent of human effort. The preacher's use of the 'Riemann Compulsive' type creates a sermon that is structured and demanding, which may mobilize some but will likely burden the 'depressive' or 'struggling' hearer with a sense of inadequacy. The interaction between psychology and theology here is one where psychological 'success' is the goal, and God is the means to that end—a reversal of the Barthian priority where God is the Subject and human 'success' is irrelevant to the reality of Grace.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a significant risk of psychologization. The sermon treats 'spiritual power' as a human achievement ('how it is done') rather than a sovereign act of God.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Excellent narrative opening that captures attention.",
      "Strong integration of Scripture (Psalms 1, 16, 23, 51).",
      "Clear, logical progression of thought."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Shift the focus from human 'achieving' to God's 'acting'.",
      "Reduce the moralistic pressure in the 'Appeal' side.",
      "Balance the 'Yellow' relationship signals to be more solidary and less paternalistic."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively competent but theologically 'heavy' sermon that prioritizes the Law (Anspruch) over the Gospel (Zuspruch), risking the creation of 'weary' rather than 'restored' souls."
