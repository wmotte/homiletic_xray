    "summary": "The sermon is a sophisticated blend of Nurturing Parent care and Critical Parent boundary-setting. It provides a strong sense of security for the listener by discrediting 'outside' intellectual threats (scholars, media). While it validates human suffering (Adult/NP), it creates a dependency on the preacher’s own '20 years' of expertise and the 'trustworthiness' of the tradition, rather than empowering the listener to process the data independently. The 'Stealth Bomber' metaphor is a clever hook but ultimately reinforces a Parent-Child dynamic where God (and the preacher) knows the 'secret' that the world does not.",

      "Validates the 'Victim' position of those in pain without immediate 'Rescuer' platitudes.",
      "Strong use of the Nurturing Parent to provide emotional containment during a somber holiday."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Heavy reliance on 'Us vs. Them' rhetoric (Critical Parent).",
      "Appeal to personal authority ('I have been teaching... for 20 years') creates a Parent-Child hierarchy."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to present the 'trendy scholars' or 'academic theories' with Adult objectivity rather than Critical Parent dismissal. This allows the congregation to use their own Adult ego state to choose the 'Biblical witness' rather than being shamed into it."
