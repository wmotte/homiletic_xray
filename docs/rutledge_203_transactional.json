    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Redemptive Shaming.' It uses high-quality Nurturing Parent language to build trust before switching to a Critical Parent stance that demands the listener adopt a 'miserable' identity. While theologically traditional, it fosters psychological dependency by insisting that 'no health' exists within the individual, thereby positioning the preacher/church as the sole Rescuer.",

      "Heavy reliance on the 'Miserable Offender' script which can trigger toxic shame.",
      "Lack of an Adult-to-Adult invitation for the listener to find internal resources or strength."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to present the 'need for grace' without requiring the listener to first agree they are 'miserable' or 'without health.' Address the congregation as capable Adults who can choose to enter into relationship with God, rather than as self-destructive children who must be rescued from their own nature."
