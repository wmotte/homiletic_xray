  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely game-free. It utilizes the Adult ego state to analyze systemic oppression while inviting the listener's Free Child to experience joy and transformation. By identifying the 'sin' as systemic collusion rather than individual moral failure, it avoids the Critical Parent trap. It promotes autonomy by framing the resurrection as a 'practice' and 'engagement' rather than a passive belief.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement through rhetorical questioning.",
      "High value placed on the 'Free Child' (joy, leaping, dancing).",
      "Avoidance of the Drama Triangle by refusing to 'Rescue' the congregation."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The critique of 'military capitalism' could potentially trigger an 'Adapted Child' response (guilt) in some listeners if not balanced with more NP (Nurturing Parent) support.",
      "The 'Ecce Homo' refrain is powerful but could become a 'Parental' mantra if overused."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'Have you noticed?' as it keeps the listener in their Adult ego state. Ensure that the 'call to repent' remains an invitation to freedom rather than a Parental demand for compliance."
