    "summary": "The sermon is intellectually stimulating (Adult) but psychologically heavy (Critical Parent). It utilizes a 'Bait & Switch' tactic, first flattering the audience as 'avant-garde' before pivoting to a crushing diagnosis of 'total incapacity.' While theologically orthodox in many traditions, the psychological impact reinforces a 'I'm Not OK - You're Not OK' (until the Exchange) dynamic, which can foster dependency and deep-seated guilt rather than autonomous faith.",
