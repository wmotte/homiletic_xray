    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a robust exegetical and dogmatic framework, contrasting contemporary 'New Age' angelology with Biblical angelology. The 'Sache' (the living Christ) is clearly prioritized over the phenomena of angels. The preacher correctly identifies that in the Old Testament, angels are 'pure, unmitigated divine presence' rather than independent deities. The use of the Epistle to the Hebrews and the Joshua narrative serves to ground the sermon in a Christocentric reading of the Old Testament. However, the transition from the critique of commercialism to the critique of social policy (Social Services Block Grant) introduces a secondary factual layer that, while ethically grounded, slightly shifts the 'Sache' from Christology to socio-political polemics.",
      "quotes": [
        "In the Bible, angels are of no interest in themselves. They exist only to direct our attention to God.",
        "The Biblical angel is at the furthest possible remove from the guardian angel lapel pins available at the checkout counters.",
        "The true test of an angelic appearance is quite simple: Does it glorify Christ?"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong distinction between 'fides quae' (dogma) and cultural sentimentality.",
        "Excellent use of historical art and literary references to deepen the factual horizon."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The jump to specific 1996 block grant statistics feels slightly dated and interrupts the theological flow.",
        "Could have delved deeper into the 'No' of the angel in Joshua as a dialectical theological category."
      ],
      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The preacher uses accessible cultural touchstones (Time, Oprah) to explain complex theological shifts."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a persona that is intellectually rigorous yet pastorally concerned. There is a conscious 'Selbstdarstellung' of a traditionalist who is 'beginning to think it’s time to call a halt' to modern nonsense. The 'I' is largely diaconal, serving the text, though a moment of personal vulnerability 'leaks' when mentioning 'someone very dear to me is going through a terrible ordeal.' This provides a glimpse into the preacher's own struggle with the 'No' of God, moving the sermon from a lecture to a shared existential space. The tone is authoritative but not arrogant, reflecting a person who finds comfort in the 'austere' rather than the 'cute'.",
      "quotes": [
        "I’m beginning to think it’s time to call a halt.",
        "I have always loved angels myself — I decorate my house with them at Christmas just like everybody else.",
        "I know all about that. Someone very dear to me is going through a terrible ordeal right this minute."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Schizoid. The preacher shows 'Compulsive' traits through a desire for correctness and a 'stern warning' against the disorder of New Age cults. The 'Schizoid' element appears in the preference for 'remote', 'austere', and 'hieratic' images over human closeness.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is mostly subservient, used primarily to establish common ground before pivoting to the 'Sache'.",
      "strengths": [
        "Honesty about personal traditions (decorating with angels) prevents hypocrisy.",
        "Controlled use of personal emotion in the final third."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The initial critique can come across as slightly 'grumpy', potentially alienating those with a 'Depressive' ear seeking warmth."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher-Congregation' with a strong 'We-definition' regarding the community's failures. The preacher speaks 'at eye level' when discussing shared cultural habits, but moves to a 'paternalistic' authority when correcting theological errors. There is 'relationship noise' in the section regarding social services; the preacher assumes a shared political alignment that might repel listeners who do not see the 15% grant cut as a direct 'judgment of God'. However, the final section shifts to a 'solidary' relationship, acknowledging the 'fiery furnaces' the congregation members are facing.",
      "quotes": [
        "God has a case against us.",
        "Christian people need to be a lot less focused on angel sightings and a lot more focused on... the Social Services Block Grant.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily a call to shift focus: from self-help to God's holiness, and from sentimentality to ethical responsibility. The preacher successfully navigates the Law/Gospel (Anspruch/Zuspruch) tension. The 'Law' is the judgment of God against a self-centered culture; the 'Gospel' is the 'Fear not' and the presence of Christ in the fire. The appeal to work in a 'soup kitchen' serves as a concrete behavioral demand (Anspruch), but it is ultimately grounded in the 'Yes' of Christ (Zuspruch). The sermon avoids pure moralism by concluding with the promise that the future belongs to Christ.",
      "quotes": [
        "If people want to get in touch with their angels, they’d be a lot better off working at a soup kitchen.",
        "The first words of angels to human beings have to be 'Fear not.'",
        "For all the promises of God find their Yes in him."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The balance is well-maintained; the 'Anspruch' (social concern) is presented as the fruit of understanding the 'Zuspruch' (God's mercy).",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Moderate. The critique of 'angel worship' risks becoming a moralistic lecture on 'proper' piety if not for the final Christological turn.",
      "strengths": [
        "Strong theological grounding of the 'Fear not' as a divine necessity.",
        "Clear directional force toward Christology."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The appeal to social action could be more organically linked to the 'holiness' of God rather than just a reaction to New Age trends."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7,
    "summary": "This is a strong, intellectually rigorous sermon that successfully deconstructs a cultural idol (sentimental angelology) to reveal a theological 'Sache' (the sovereignty of Christ). The preacher utilizes the Schulz von Thun dimensions effectively, though the 'Blue' side dominates. The transition from the critique of 'New Age' fluff to the 'Red' side of social responsibility is a classic homiletical move, though it risks datedness. Theologically, it follows a Barthian trajectory by refusing to let God be an object of human 'experience' or 'self-help,' insisting instead on God as the Acting Subject. The psychological 'Riemann' profile of the preacher (Compulsive-Schizoid) provides a necessary 'austere' counter-balance to the 'Hysterical' nature of the angel-craze being critiqued. The sermon's greatest strength lies in its final movement, where the 'No' of judgment is subsumed by the 'Yes' of Christ in the fire. This provides a 'healing disruption' that moves the listener from dread to trust.",
    "barthian_warning": "Low risk. The preacher explicitly fights against the psychologization of faith ('inner angel') and maintains the 'infinite qualitative distinction' between God and human sentiment.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Rigorous biblical-theological deconstruction of cultural myths.",
      "Excellent integration of art and literature (Rilke, Byron).",
      "Strong Christocentric conclusion that provides genuine comfort (Zuspruch)."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Smooth out the transition to specific political policy to avoid 'relationship noise'.",
      "Increase 'Green' side warmth earlier in the sermon to balance the 'Compulsive' rigor.",
      "Update cultural references (though appropriate for 1996) to maintain 'Blue' side relevance."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively integral and theologically sound sermon that serves the 'Sache' with precision and pastoral sobriety."
