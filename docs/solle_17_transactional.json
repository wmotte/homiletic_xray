    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It avoids the typical 'Parental' trap of religious discourse by utilizing an 'Adult' analytical framework. It validates the 'Child's' fear as a biological and biographical reality (birth trauma) rather than a moral failing. While it flirts with 'Ain't It Awful' regarding global politics, it ultimately seeks to empower the listener to transform 'energy' from fear into 'productive instruments'. It promotes horizontal (Adult-Adult) community over vertical dependency.",
    "strengths": [
      "Validation of fear as a natural human state.",
      "Rejection of the 'Rescuer' role in favor of 'Brother/Friend'.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The collective 'we' of guilt can sometimes bypass individual Adult conscience.",
      "The transition from 'birth trauma' to 'political radicalism' is a large leap that might overwhelm the listener's Adult."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To remain completely game-free, ensure that the 'we' of the guilt-analysis is balanced with specific, individual Adult choices to avoid the 'Ain't It Awful' collective passivity."
