  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy, leaning heavily on the Nurturing Parent to soothe the Adapted Child's anxieties. It avoids the 'shame-cycles' common in many sermons. By defining salvation as 'wholeness' (salvus), it bridges the gap between theology and psychological health. The preacher uses the 'Adult' to provide historical context but primarily aims for the 'Free Child's' sense of relief and joy. The main risk is the 'Rescuer' dynamic, which may oversimplify complex life problems as being solved by a single 'look.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong affirmation of the listener's potential for 'wholeness'.",
      "Avoidance of Critical Parent 'must'/shame language.",
      "Authentic self-disclosure of the preacher's own sense of purpose."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Adult' could be strengthened by acknowledging that 'looking' doesn't always result in an immediate 'sunlight' experience.",
      "Slightly less 'Rescuer' language regarding 'solver of all problems' to avoid setting up unrealistic expectations."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize 'finding one's own key' as a personal, Adult responsibility rather than a passive miracle, to further promote listener autonomy."
