Jesus simply plunged into the Jordan River. It was, we are told, a baptism of “repentance for the forgiveness of sins.” [...] Now in Lent we take the plunge yet again. It is a plunge into a new vocation. He called it “good news.” He said, “Follow me.” He performed his new ministry of healing and then he invited his followers to do the same."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon identifies the specific pericope of Mark 1. However, it fails Dekker's test of finding what is 'NOWHERE else in the Bible.' Instead of mining the unique Marcan 'schizo' (tearing open) of the heavens, it treats the text as a general template for baptismal vocation. It drifts into 1 Peter 3 and Psalm 91, diluting the specificity of the Marcan text.",

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "There is a clear attempt at exposition regarding the 'Son' as a coronation title and the 'wild beasts' as a threat. The preacher understands the literary structure ('quickly and tersely'). However, the exegesis remains somewhat superficial, serving more as a springboard for the application rather than a deep dive into the Greek or the specific theological history of Israel.",
      "quotes": [
        "The phrase 'You are my Son' is used for coronations when the old king empowered the new, young king.",
        "Mark wants us to notice that this event was very special and inexplicable."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is frequent but tends toward the general truths Dekker forbids. Terms like 'healing, transformation, forgiveness' are abstract. While 'Wall Street' and 'racism' are mentioned, they are used as buzzwords rather than concrete applications of the specific text to the specific congregation's life.",
      "quotes": [
        "The vocation of baptism calls us to do God's work in the world—work of healing, transformation, forgiveness, reconciliation.",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a 'two-block' structure: Part I is Jesus (exposition), Part II is 'Us' (application). This is exactly what Dekker warns against. It makes the relevance of the text feel like a secondary 'imitation' rather than a single movement where the hearer is 'expounded' by the Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "I imagine that what happened to Jesus in his baptism might be what happens to us in our baptism as well.",
        "But of course the story does not linger too long over Jesus as such, but turns attention to his disciples..."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward 'vocation' (gratitude/sanctification) and 'wilderness' (misery), but it is too Christocentric in a way that Dekker warns against—it risks becoming objective. The 'misery' is externalized as 'the world' or 'greed' rather than the hearer's own misery before God.",

      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are largely absent. While 'being lost in time' is hinted at through the failure of vocation, there is no real sense of the 'broad way that leads to destruction.' The tone is too safe; the 'wild beasts' are mentioned but the ultimate stakes of human choice are softened by the 'angels' always being there.",

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the subject of the first half, but the sermon shifts toward the 'vocation' of the believer. Christ becomes a 'conduit' or 'agent' rather than the 'telos' who is God. The doctrine of the two natures is not felt; Jesus is more of a pioneer of a new lifestyle.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus is given a peculiar vocation that the church celebrates. It is a calling to be God’s agent...",

      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1250 words, the sermon would take about 12-13 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for 'depth.' The brevity contributes to the use of generalities rather than specific, concrete exposition and application.",

  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily due to its brevity and its 'two-block' structure which separates exposition from application. It relies on general theological categories (vocation, healing, greed) rather than the specific, unique word of the Marcan text. The seriousness of the 'two ways' is missing, replaced by a somewhat optimistic view of 'vocation' and 'angelic' protection.",
    "strengths": [
      "Clear identification of the Marcan literary style ('quick and terse').",
      "Effective use of the 'wilderness' as a zone of discomfort rather than just a place of quiet."

    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (approx. 12 minutes) prevents theological depth.",
      "Separation of Jesus' story and the congregation's story into distinct sections.",
      "Lack of concrete, specific application; reliance on general 'liberal' or 'orthodox' tropes about greed and racism."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is a thematic reflection on baptismal vocation using the text as an illustration rather than an actualization of the Word of God that finds what is unique to the passage."
