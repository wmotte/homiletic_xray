      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is grounded in visceral human experience. It avoids abstract 'humanity' and instead names specific historical and contemporary sufferings. The identification with Mary Magdalene's grief is not just a rhetorical device but a shared emotional state. The use of Sölle's poetry facilitates a deep emotional connection to the 'stilled' and 'frozen' state of despair.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels at identifying the 'problem'—the 'logic of death' and the 'cynicism of the powerful.' It pauses to ask why we have become silent and why the church has historically failed (e.g., anti-Judaism). It provides a cultural critique of the 'Two-Thirds Society' and the 'logic of growth.' However, it sometimes moves quickly from observation to political judgment without allowing the hearer to sit with the 'why' of their own complicity in a neutral way.",

      "analysis": "Theological depth is present but is often subordinated to political ethics. The exegesis of John 20 is solid, particularly the 'Noli me tangere' and the commissioning. The 'Big Idea' is the 'Macht der Auferstehung' (Power of Resurrection) as a counter-power to the 'Reich des Todes.' However, traditional dogmatic categories are intentionally deconstructed (e.g., God as Father/Mother), which might leave hearers seeking traditional logic somewhat unmoored.",

It calls for a 'Selbstversorgungswirtschaft' (subsistence economy) and concrete changes in lifestyle (baking bread, half-time work for men). It moves from the 'What' to the 'How,' though the 'How' is a radical societal shift that may feel unattainable for the average hearer.",

    "summary": "This sermon is a robust example of political-feminist homiletics that successfully integrates the four phases of Kolb, though with a clear bias toward the 'Accommodating' and 'Diverging' quadrants. It begins with a deep, visceral engagement with grief (Concrete Experience) and moves through a sharp critique of societal 'death-logic' (Reflective Observation). The theological core (Abstract Conceptualization) redefines resurrection not as a past event but as a present 'Gegenmacht' (counter-power). The sermon concludes with highly specific, albeit radical, calls for economic and ecclesiastical restructuring (Active Experimentation). While it lacks traditional dogmatic 'safety,' it offers a coherent and challenging learning process for the hearer.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a strong, contextualized piece of homiletics that prioritizes the 'Heart' and 'Hands.' From a Kolb perspective, it is highly effective at moving the hearer from a state of passive despair to active hope. Its primary diagnosis is that it risks 'moralism' by setting the bar for 'Active Experimentation' so high (total economic withdrawal) that it may leave the 'average' hearer behind. However, as a model of how to weave biblical narrative into contemporary political struggle, it is a clear and effective example of the 'Visionary-Pragmatic' structure."
