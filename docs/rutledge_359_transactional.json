  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and game-free. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent (demanding joy) or the Rescuer (promising a fix). By utilizing the Adult ego state to process the reality of death and the Nurturing Parent to validate lament, the preacher creates a safe space for the listener's Free Child to eventually experience authentic joy without the weight of Adapted Child compliance.",
    "strengths": [
      "Validation of negative emotions (lament/doubt) prevents the 'Adapted Child' trap.",
      "Strong Adult reality-testing regarding suffering.",
      "Refusal to play the 'Rescuer' in the face of tragedy."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the 'Abundant Life' section could risk being seen as a 'Bait & Switch' if not for the careful qualification that joy is often 'only in the form of promise' for now."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' to name the 'Crossup' (the paradox of suffering and hope) as you did here. This prevents the listener from feeling manipulated by a 'Con' of easy happiness."
