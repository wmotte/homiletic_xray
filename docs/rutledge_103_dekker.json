    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon fails the primary test of specificity. While Matthew 28:16-20 is cited, the text is treated as a springboard for a thematic discussion on 'Epiphany' and 'Mission'. The preacher does not identify what is in this specific passage that can be found nowhere else; instead, the sermon drifts into Romans, 1 Corinthians, and general liturgical themes.",
      "quotes": [
        "The season of Epiphany, if its narrative structure is unfolded with the idea of glorifying Christ, is a powerful antidote...",
        "The season with its readings takes us through some of the highest epiphanies..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus exclusively on the specific details of Matthew 28—such as the 'mountain', the 'doubt' of the disciples, or the specific trinitarian formula—rather than speaking about the liturgical season of Epiphany."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "There is a lack of rigorous exegesis. The preacher mentions Greek terms ('ho erchomenos') but uses them to support a general dogmatic point rather than uncovering the original meaning of the Matthew passage for its first readers. The historical context of the 'eleven' in Galilee is ignored in favor of 19th-century Episcopal history.",
      "quotes": [
        "the one who comes (ho erchomenos; see Revelation 1:4) on the last day to be our judge.",
        "the 'righteousness of God' (or 'justice' of God—same word in Greek and Hebrew) is a gift..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must use their knowledge of Greek and biblical history to explain why Jesus directed the disciples specifically to a mountain in Galilee and what 'authority' meant in that specific post-resurrection context."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application is somewhat concrete regarding the 'zeitgeist' (mentioning Nicholas Kristof, 'progressive' vs 'evangelical' churches), but it remains a critique of church trends rather than a concrete application of the text to the spiritual life of the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "The left-leaning, 'progressive' churches have tended to present Jesus as a great religious figure...",
        "The right-leaning, self-identified 'evangelical' churches, on the other hand, tend to a highly individualized concept of sin..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move away from critiquing ecclesiastical 'camps' and apply the command to 'make disciples' to the concrete, personal lives of the congregation members."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exposition and application are not mixed because there is very little actual exposition of the text. The sermon functions more as a theological essay or a 'speech about the gospel' (which Dekker explicitly forbids) than a movement where the hearer is drawn into the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries... the season of Epiphany in the Episcopal Church was focused on mission."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Start with the text itself and let the contemporary application emerge directly from the exegesis, rather than starting with church history."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The three parts are present in the background. Misery is addressed through the concept of 'chaff' and 'sin', redemption through the 'unearned gift', and gratitude as the proper response. However, it feels more like a dogmatic lecture than a psychological reality for the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "all of us are 'chaff' in a sense, for 'none is righteous, no, not one'",
        "When it is gratefully received as being undeserved and unearned, it is the ultimate good news..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'misery' more concrete to the human condition of the hearer today, rather than quoting Romans 3:10 as an objective fact."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon explicitly mentions the 'great threshing floor' and 'being lost', which aligns with Dekker’s requirement for the 'two ways'. However, the preacher immediately softens this with a 'hint of universal salvation', which may weaken the seriousness of the choice.",
      "quotes": [
        "giving angels charge at last / in the fire the tares to cast",
        "If there is a hint of universal salvation here, so be it; it is only a hint..."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon emphasizes His authority and His role as the 'unique Lamb of God'. It correctly identifies that the church's reason for being is delivering the person of Jesus.",
      "quotes": [
        "Delivering the gospel message is the same thing as delivering the person of Jesus himself.",
        "In him is contained all of the wonder of creation..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure that the Christology is derived from the specific 'All authority' of the Matthew text rather than a general Trinitarian summary."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "At approximately 1150 words, the sermon would take about 11-12 minutes to deliver. This is significantly below Dekker's 20-minute minimum. The lack of 'breadth' results in a lack of 'depth' regarding the specific text.",
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must expand the exposition of the specific Bible passage to reach the required depth and duration."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text functions more as a theological reflection on the liturgical season of Epiphany than a sermon as defined by Dekker. It lacks a specific focus on the unique contribution of the Matthew 28 pericope and is significantly too short to achieve the necessary homiletical depth. While it correctly identifies Christ as the telos and maintains a sober view of sin and grace, it remains too general and 'thematic'.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christocentric focus that avoids reducing Jesus to a mere moral example.",
      "Willingness to address the 'two ways' and the reality of judgment/sin (misery).",
      "Adequate awareness of the contemporary zeitgeist and ecclesiastical tensions."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Failure to ground the message in the specific, unique details of the chosen Bible passage.",
      "Insufficient length (approx. 11 minutes) to provide the 'breadth' required for 'depth'.",
      "Thematic approach: it is a speech about 'mission' and 'Epiphany' rather than an exposition of Matthew 28."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "According to Dekker’s criteria, this is not yet a sermon. It is an edifying theological essay. To become a sermon, it must be anchored in the 'NOWHERE else' of the specific text and expanded to allow the Word to truly work through exposition and application."
