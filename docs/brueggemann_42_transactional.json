    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of 'Prophetic Parent' rhetoric. While theologically rich, it is psychologically coercive. It creates a high-stakes environment where the listener's Adult ego is bypassed in favor of an Adapted Child response (obedience). The use of the word 'slave' to define the relationship with the divine, while biblically grounded, functions psychologically to suppress the listener's autonomy and healthy self-actualization, labeling the latter as 'self-indulgence.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Clear, logical structure (Adult appeal in form).",

      "High dependency on 'Parent' imperatives (must, ought).",
      "Binary framing of 'Church vs. World' encourages 'Ain't It Awful' dynamics.",
      "Devaluation of personal initiative and self-regard."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try using more 'I' statements instead of 'The Church teaches.' Invite the congregation to 'Adult' reflection by asking questions that don't have a pre-determined 'Parent' answer. Acknowledge the validity of the listener's struggle with 'cost' without immediately labeling it as 'self-indulgence.'"
