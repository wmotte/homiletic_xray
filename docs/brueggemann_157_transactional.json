      "analysis": "The preacher uses a high degree of Adult processing. He analyzes historical/sociological structures (Pharaoh, privatization, low wages) and invites the listener to think critically.

    "analysis": "The preacher primarily uses information-sharing and structural analysis to invite the listener into an Adult state of self-evaluation. While he uses Parent-like authority to interpret scripture, it is directed toward empowering the listener's Adult to choose between two ideologies.",
    "ulterior_motives": "The 'Communist' framing is a social A->A transaction that carries a psychological 'hook' to provoke the listener's Critical Parent, but the preacher immediately grounds it in biblical exegesis to return to Adult.",

    "risk_explanation": "The only risk is the 'Bait' of the Helder Camara quote, which could be seen as a 'Con' to trigger political defensiveness, but the preacher uses it to clarify a theological point rather than to 'win' a game."

    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exceptionally healthy example of Adult-Adult communication. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent (shaming the rich or the anxious) and instead uses structural analysis to explain why the listener feels anxious. By identifying 'Pharaoh' as a metaphor for an ideology, the preacher allows the listener to examine their own participation in 'scarcity' without triggering the Adapted Child's defensiveness. The use of the Free Child (the cat, the birds) adds a layer of authentic warmth that prevents the Adult analysis from becoming dry or academic.",
    "strengths": [
      "High Adult presence promotes listener autonomy.",
      "Avoidance of the Drama Triangle; the preacher refuses to play Rescuer.",
      "Inclusive language ('all of us') prevents NIGYSOB games."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Communist' label is a high-risk Gimmick that could trigger a 'Crossed Transaction' (Listener's CP reacting to the word) before the Adult message is heard.",
      "Slight risk of 'Nurturing Parent' smothering in the Psalm section, though mitigated by the call to action."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' and 'us' when discussing the 'hard work' of the gospel to maintain the Adult-Adult contract. Ensure that the 'Communist' provocation is always immediately linked back to the 'Adult' data of systemic poverty to avoid a purely emotional 'Child' reaction from the pews."
