    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on one specific pericope. It jumps between Revelation, Acts, and Psalm 23. This prevents the preacher from finding what is unique to a single text. Instead of 'recreating' the Bible into a current word, the preacher uses the texts as illustrations for a pre-conceived theme of 'empire vs. gospel'.",

        "The book of Revelation is about a big decision...",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is a rudimentary acknowledgement of the original context (Roman Empire), but it is quickly flattened into a modern sociological category. The mention of 'Aramaic' and 'Greek' for Tabitha/Dorcas is a superficial academic marker that does not lead to deeper theological exposition of the text's original meaning.",
      "quotes": [
        "The 'great ordeal' is the time when the empire had gone after gospel people...",
        "named Dorcas (in Greek), named Tabitha (in Aramaic)."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is largely ideological and general. While it mentions 'corporations' and 'militarism', these function as general labels rather than concrete spiritual guidance for the congregation. The airplane seat anecdote is trivial and disconnected from the 'great ordeal' described in the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "We might think of the enforcers like hard-nosed judges... or police... or surveillance mechanisms...",
        "the empire of militarism, the empire of consumerism, the empire of greed and fear..."

      "improvement_point": "Avoid listing general societal 'evils'. Address the specific ways the congregation is currently 'lost in time' or how the 'newness of God' specifically interrupts their local reality."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon does attempt to mix the biblical narrative with contemporary categories. The hearer is drawn into the 'ordeal'. However, because the exposition is thin, the interwoven application feels more like a political lecture than a revelation of the Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "The great ordeal is the effort of established power—government, corporations, media, orthodoxy—to talk us out of authentic gospel obedience."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'application' arises strictly from the 'exposition' of the Greek/Hebrew text rather than from a pre-existing cultural philosophy."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is present but defined primarily as external oppression (the Empire) rather than the biblical 'misery before God'. Redemption is portrayed as 'enacting futures' and 'making decisions', which risks becoming Pelagian. Gratitude is present in the 'singing', but it is not clearly a response to the Spirit's work.",
      "quotes": [
        "The followers of Christ were abused by the empire...",
        "They enacted such futures in defiance of the way the empire had arranged things."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the sense of misery. It is not just the 'hard-nosed judges' who are the problem; it is the human condition before God. Redemption must be more clearly an act of God, not just a human 'big decision'."

      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is a stronger point. The preacher emphasizes that 'choices matter' and life is not a 'vacation'. There is a clear call to decision. However, the 'loss' is framed almost entirely as 'temporal loss' (failing to answer a calling) with no mention of the eternal dimension Dekker requires.",
      "quotes": [
        "A person can be lost in time... our life consists in such small decisions...",
        "Most capitulated to the empire. But these are the ones who stayed with the faith..."

      "findings": "Christ (the Lamb) is the 'telos', but He is presented more as a model for 'vulnerability' and 'alternative power' than as the ontological Savior (God). The 'two natures' are not felt; Christ is a 'stand-in' for a certain type of power rather than the source of life outside ourselves.",

      "improvement_point": "Move from Christ as an 'alternative vision' to Christ as the one in whom we have life because we have none in ourselves. Emphasize grace as the 'deepest of our life' rather than our 'big decision' as the starting point."

      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1,150 words, the sermon lasts about 11-12 minutes. This is significantly below Dekker's 20-minute minimum. The lack of 'breadth' results in a lack of 'depth'; the sermon remains at the level of a thematic address.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exposition of the specific Bible passage. Depth requires more than 12 minutes to unfold the 'present of revelation'."

  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily due to its lack of focus on a specific pericope and its insufficient length. It functions as a thematic speech about 'Empire vs. Gospel' rather than an exposition of the Word of God. The application is overly sociological and the Christology is more exemplary than redemptive.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong emphasis on the seriousness of human choice and the 'two ways' of living.",
      "Effective use of the 'ordeal' concept to challenge the hearer's current life design."

    "weaknesses": [
      "Fails the formal definition by using multiple passages as illustrations for a general theme.",
      "Duration is too short to achieve the necessary theological depth.",
      "Misery and Redemption are framed in political/sociological terms rather than theological/coram Deo terms."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is a religious-political speech. It lacks the specific recreation of a single Bible passage into a current proclamatory word and fails the requirement of length and depth."
