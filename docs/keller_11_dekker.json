We’re taking a part of the Lord’s Prayer each week and going to some part of the Bible to help us understand the biblical teaching behind the phrase. [...] Someday I’m not going to just wake up from the sleep in my bed; I’m going to wake up into my new body, all because Jesus Christ lay down in death for me and was raised for my justification. I can hope. I can live in the knowledge of that coming kingdom. Thy kingdom come. Let us pray."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Luke 6 as a lens for the Lord's Prayer. While it stays with the text, it immediately imports Matthew 5 to harmonize and interpret Luke. It fails Dekker's test of finding what is unique to *this* passage by smoothing over Luke's distinct, harsh material 'woes' with Matthew's spiritualized 'poor in spirit'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Matthew 5 is a little more famous... but Luke 6 is another place where he talks about the kingdom",
        "In Matthew, chapter 5, Jesus gives this sermon again, and there he says, 'Blessed are the poor in spirit.'... What that means is... you’re not a Christian unless you’re poor in spirit."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus on the specific 'Luke-ness' of the text—the literal poverty and the physical woes—rather than immediately retreating to the more comfortable spiritual categories of Matthew."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is thin. The preacher mentions a Greek word ('laugh' as 'gloat') but provides no historical context regarding Israel, the social reality of the first readers, or the specific theology of Luke. The 'coach' analogy replaces historical exegesis with modern management theory.",
      "quotes": [
        "This word laugh is a Greek word that means to gloat.",
        "When we Americans think of kingdom, we have a bit of a blur... I want you to know that when a coach takes over a major college football or basketball team..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Replace the 'coach' analogy with an exploration of the socio-political reality of the Roman Empire versus the Kingdom of God as understood in the 1st-century Jewish context."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the 'zeitgeist' of New York (power, success, recognition). However, it often lapses into generalities about 'serving God' and 'being a Christian' rather than specific ethical demands of the Lucan text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now this is New York City, and we are the capital of the kingdom of this world.",
        "The Bible says you should tithe... I’m not preaching on that."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the application of the 'woes' more biting for the specific congregation. Instead of general 'success', address specific local idols."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a thematic structure (What it is, what it's not, etc.) rather than an organic movement where the hearer is 'expounded' with the text. The application is often a separate section at the end of each point.",
      "quotes": [
        "I want to show you what the kingdom of God is, what it’s not, what it’s like, how you enter it, and then we’ll apply it..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Abandon the 'five-point' lecture structure. Allow the text's own movement to dictate the flow, mixing the explanation of the 'woes' directly with the contemporary 'woes' of the city."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon strongly addresses misery (spiritual bankruptcy) and redemption (Christ's reversal). Gratitude is present in the final section on prayer and obedience. It successfully avoids a purely objective Christocentrism by focusing on the 'poor in spirit' subject.",
      "quotes": [
        "Not until you’re spiritually poor... will you turn to Jesus Christ as your Savior.",
        "Jesus Christ was reversing places with us."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' section by connecting it to the 'woes'—the actual danger of being rich and well-fed—rather than just the absence of spiritual poverty."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are present through the contrast of the two kingdoms. The preacher mentions the possibility of being 'lost' (disillusionment/suicide), but the eternal dimension of the 'woes' is somewhat softened into psychological unhappiness.",
      "quotes": [
        "The disillusionment turned them howling and insufferable.",
        "If your king... is anything but God, it’s going to distort your life."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'woes' as actual divine judgment rather than just a 'rotten practical joke' or psychological disillusionment."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The 'reversal' theology (He became poor so we become rich) is the pivot of the sermon. It maintains the necessity of grace for salvation.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus Christ reversed places with us, he gets what we deserve so we get what he deserves.",
        "He, though he was rich, became poor."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the Christology is drawn specifically from the Lucan context of the 'Son of Man' rather than a general Pauline substitutionary model."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At approximately 24 minutes, the sermon meets Dekker's requirement for breadth to achieve depth. It allows time for illustrations and theological development.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this length but increase the density of biblical exposition relative to the modern analogies."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily by harmonizing the specific Lucan text with Matthew, thereby losing the 'nowhere else' quality of Luke's literal woes. It relies heavily on modern analogies (coaches, movie stars) which, while effective for communication, occasionally displace rigorous biblical exposition. However, it successfully maintains a Trinitarian structure and centers on the necessity of grace.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong focus on the 'reversal' of the Gospel as the mechanism of salvation.",
      "Adequate length allows for substantive theological reflection.",
      "Clear identification of the 'zeitgeist' in a specific urban context."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Weak exegesis of the original historical and religious context of Luke.",
      "Harmonization with Matthew 5 dilutes the specific challenge of Luke 6.",
      "Thematic structure (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) creates a lecture-like separation between text and hearer."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a functional sermon that provides psychological and spiritual help, but it lacks the 'sober' and 'specific' scriptural rigor Dekker demands. It is more of a thematic address on the Kingdom than an exposition of Luke 6."
