      "analysis": "The sermon lacks a specific, individual 'slice of life' story that would allow for deep emotional identification. It operates more on a collective sociological level. While it mentions 'white, male, and heterosexual' privilege, these remain categories rather than concrete experiences. The 'feeling' level is addressed through the imagery of singing, but it feels more like a description of a scene than an invitation into an experience.",

He moves from the first-century 'ordeal' to a contemporary 'anguish,' providing a sharp cultural critique of privilege, environmental indifference, and the psychological roots of societal resentment.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of cultural-theological analysis that effectively bridges a difficult biblical text (Revelation) with contemporary societal shifts. It falls short in providing a truly 'Concrete Experience' for the hearer, as it avoids personal narrative in favor of broad sociological categories. The 'Reflective Observation' is the sermon's peak, offering a sober diagnosis of modern 'anguish' as the death of privilege. The 'Abstract Conceptualization' is solid, framing baptism as a current vocation. However, the 'Active Experimentation' remains at the level of ethical stances rather than concrete, daily actions. It is a sermon that will deeply engage the 'Assimilating' learner but may leave the 'Accommodating' learner looking for more personal or practical handles.",

      "Use more 'I' or 'You' language in the Concrete Experience phase to increase identification."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon provides a high-quality intellectual and prophetic analysis of Revelation 7. Its primary value lies in its ability to interpret the 'signs of the times' through a theological lens, making it a strong 'Declarative' and 'Visionary' piece. From a Kolb perspective, it is somewhat unbalanced, favoring reflection and conceptualization over concrete experience and practical experimentation. While it successfully challenges the hearer's worldview, it provides fewer handles for the hearer's emotional or practical life. The priority for improvement is the integration of specific, recognizable human narratives to ground the abstract sociological categories."
