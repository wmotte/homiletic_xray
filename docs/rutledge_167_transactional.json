    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably 'game-free.' It utilizes the Adult ego state to deconstruct the typical religious game of projecting evil onto others. By defining repentance as 'insight' rather than 'groveling,' it promotes listener autonomy and self-awareness. It successfully balances the Critical Parent language of the liturgy with a strong, supportive Nurturing Parent and an objective Adult.",

      "Validation of the listener's need for safety (dropping defenses)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The liturgical prayer at the end contains high CP language ('wretchedness') which could trigger an Adapted Child response if not carefully contextualized by the preacher's tone."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' language to maintain the Adult-Adult level and prevent the congregation from slipping into a 'Victim' position before a 'Persecuting' God."
