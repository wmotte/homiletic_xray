    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The factual content is primarily anecdotal rather than exegetical. The preacher uses the 'Sache' of the Cross not through a deep dive into the Greek text or historical context, but through the lens of human resistance. The theological core—substitutionary atonement ('in our place')—is presented clearly but briefly at the end. The 'blue' side serves as a mirror for the human condition rather than an objective lecture on dogma. While the connection between the 'common criminal' status of Jesus and the listener's sin is logically sound, the sermon lacks a robust engagement with the Matthew text mentioned at the start, using it merely as a springboard for the anecdotes.",
      "quotes": [

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals themselves as a seasoned observer of human nature, likely a long-term pastor given the specific memories of 'Sally' and 'Jane'. There is a subtle 'leak' of frustration or perhaps a sense of pastoral failure ('I was unable to put this across'). The preacher positions themselves as one who 'knows' the truth that the characters in the story miss. This creates a slight distance; the preacher is the narrator of others' blindness rather than a fellow-struggler in the moment of the story, though they attempt to bridge this by including themselves in the 'all the rest of us' category later.",
      "quotes": [
        "I knew it to be a fact that she made life difficult for her family.",
        "I have often thought, since, how terribly sad that was.",
        "I was unable to put this across."

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive/Schizoid. The preacher values correctness and 'seeing the truth' (Compulsive) and maintains a diagnostic distance from the subjects of the stories (Schizoid).",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is mostly diaconal, serving as a witness to the resistance of the Gospel, but occasionally borders on the judgmental.",

    },
    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher/Observer to Student/Congregation'. By using 'Sally' and 'Jane' as negative examples, the preacher creates a 'we' (the congregation and preacher) versus 'them' (the blind characters) dynamic, which is risky. If a listener identifies with Sally or Jane, they may feel judged or 'pounced upon' (to use Sally's word). The tone is somewhat paternalistic. However, the transition to 'perhaps you can hear it today' attempts a more solidary invitation, though it still carries a heavy weight of 'I am telling you what they couldn't see'.",
      "quotes": [
        "In her stubborn blindness, Jane could not identify herself as a sinner.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily an appeal to 'see' and 'admit'. It is a call to self-knowledge through the Cross. Theologically, the sermon balances Law (the reality of sin) and Gospel (unconditional love) well in the conclusion. The 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is that knowing one's sin is the gateway to 'true joy'. However, the 'Anspruch' (Demand) to identify as a 'common criminal' is quite sharp. The preacher avoids moralism (doing better) in favor of a call to faith/trust (being honest). This is a strong Barthian move: the demand is simply to accept the truth of what God has already done.",
      "quotes": [
        "Blessed is he who takes no offense at me.",
        "When you really come to know the unconditional love... then you will also come to know the depth of your own participation in sin."

    "disruptions": "The 'Sally' and 'Jane' stories are so vivid they threaten to overwhelm the 'Blue' factual content of the Gospel.",

  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a sharp psychological exploration of the resistance to the Gospel. By using the 'Four-Sides-Model', we see a preacher who is highly effective on the 'Red' (Appeal) side—calling for a specific existential shift—but who operates with a 'Yellow' (Relational) tone that is somewhat diagnostic and distancing. Theologically, it follows a Barthian line by emphasizing that God’s action (the Cross) is the only true measure of human reality. However, the 'Green' (Self-revelation) side is somewhat guarded; the preacher observes the 'shame' of others without fully entering into it themselves. The 'Blue' content is subservient to the narrative, making it highly engaging but slightly thin on exegetical weight. It successfully avoids moralism, landing firmly on the necessity of 'fides qua' (the faith by which we believe).",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a slight risk of 'psychologizing' the faith by making the sermon primarily about 'self-knowledge' and 'handling violence within', though the final paragraphs successfully pivot back to God as the Acting Subject.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Powerful 'Common Criminal' metaphor.",
      "Strong distinction between 'goodness' and 'grace'.",
      "Clear, jargon-free communication."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Increase pastoral solidarity (less 'them', more 'us').",
      "Deepen the biblical exposition of the Matthew text.",
      "Introduce the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) earlier to mitigate the 'Yellow' side's judgmental weight."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A solid, communicative sermon that uses psychology to serve a theological point, though it risks alienating the listener through its diagnostic distance."
