  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates a strong grasp of the 'Sache' in the tradition of Barth and Immink. The factual content is not merely a lecture on Ezekiel but a theological exploration of God as the Acting Subject. The preacher correctly identifies the 'gospel' within Ezekiel 36:22—the radical idea that God acts for the sake of His own name, not human merit. This avoids the trap of intellectualism by linking the exegetical finding (the dryness of the bones) to the existential reality of the congregation. However, the 'blue' side occasionally leans into polemics against 'highbrow critics,' which distracts slightly from the pure theological data of the text. The distinction between 'fides quae' (the myth) and 'fides qua' (the trust) is handled with sophistication.",
      "quotes": [
        "The good news is that God’s ultimate purpose of mercy for humanity is not for our sake... it is for the sake of his holy name.",
        "The Bible can venture to give full weight to the gravity of sickness because it knows the remedy.",
        "Life is given only by the Spirit of God; 'Lord, only thou knowest.'"

      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The polemic against the 'Jesus Seminar' and 'highbrow critics' could be more integrated into the 'Sache' rather than appearing as a cultural grievance.",
        "More depth on the 'reconstitution' of the bodies vs. the 'breathing' could have sharpened the pneumatology."
      ],
      "comprehensibility_check": "Appropriate. Uses cultural touchstones (McInerney, New Yorker) to bridge the gap between ancient text and modern listener."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher exhibits a high degree of 'diaconal' self-revelation. There is a transparent admission of skepticism regarding 'deathbed scenes,' which serves to build trust with a modern, perhaps equally skeptical, audience. The 'I' is not used for self-aggrandizement but as a fellow traveler on a 'trip with this unique prophet.' The preacher reveals a personality that values intellectual honesty and is wary of 'warm fuzzy' versions of faith. This authenticity serves the text because it models the 'noble utterance of faith' found in Ezekiel: 'O Lord God, thou knowest.' The preacher does not claim to have all the answers, which paradoxically strengthens the message of God's sovereignty.",
      "quotes": [
        "Personally, I have never been very interested in deathbed scenes... I am skeptical about them.",
        "I warn you that you shouldn’t necessarily rush right home and read it.",
        "On most days of the year, if you asked me that question, I would not think of Ezekiel."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive with Schizoid tendencies. The preacher values correctness, structure, and 'unblinking scrutiny' (Compulsive), while maintaining a certain intellectual distance from 'sentimental' religion (Schizoid).",
      "diaconal_quality": "High. The preacher's skepticism and intellectual rigor are placed at the service of the Gospel's 'dazzlement.'",

        "Avoidance of 'hysterical' emotional manipulation."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Solidary' yet 'Teaching.' The preacher uses 'we' and 'us' frequently, placing themselves in the same boat as the 'sinners' and 'benighted souls.' However, there is a subtle 'from above' tone when addressing the 'cultural cool' or the 'highbrow critics.' This creates a 'We vs. Them' dynamic that might alienate a listener who identifies with the 'urbane' world being critiqued. The relationship noise here is a slight defensiveness. Nevertheless, the preacher's empathy for Mrs. McInerney and the 'black slaves' who sang the spirituals creates a warm, inclusive relationship with the suffering and the marginalized.",

        "You and I, along with the Southern Baptists... poor benighted souls that we are.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest side. The preacher masterfully navigates the Law/Gospel (Zuspruch/Anspruch) tension. The 'appeal' is not a moralistic demand for better behavior, but a call to 'submit' to the Holy Spirit and 'trust' in God's nature. By using the McInerney story, the preacher illustrates the failure of 'Anspruch' (the mother's fear of not deserving peace) and the necessity of 'Zuspruch' (God's mercy for the ungodly). The ratio is heavily weighted toward the Promise. The 'red' side is directional but not legalistic; it points toward the 'miracle of God’s in-breaking power.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Submit to him this day, with joy.",
        "It is not for your sake... but for the sake of my holy name.",
        "Lazarus, come forth."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Excellent. The demand (submit) is entirely predicated on the gift (God's nature).",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Very low. The preacher explicitly rejects the idea that we 'deserve' or 'earn' mercy.",
      "strengths": [
        "Clear rejection of 'righteous peace of mind' based on works.",
        "The appeal is an invitation to freedom, not a burden of duty."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The final appeal 'Submit to him' could be more concretely grounded in what that looks like in the 'dryness' of daily life."

    "disruptions": "The main disruption is the cultural polemic at the start, which creates a 'Yellow' noise of defensiveness before the 'Blue' content can settle.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a robust, theologically dense sermon that successfully avoids the 'non-committal warmth' of modern liberal preaching. By integrating the Schulz von Thun dimensions, we see a preacher who uses their own skepticism (Green) to validate the listener's doubts, while simultaneously presenting a 'Blue' content that is unashamedly Barthian in its focus on God as the Subject. The 'Yellow' side is slightly marred by a defensive posture against secular critics, but this is compensated for by a powerful 'Red' side that prioritizes 'Zuspruch' (Promise) over 'Anspruch' (Demand). The sermon moves from the 'dryness' of human effort to the 'breath' of the Spirit with communicative integrity. It is a 'strong' sermon (8) in its theological depth, though its 'Yellow' signals keep it at a 7.5 for general congregational reception.",
    "barthian_warning": "Minimal psychologization. The preacher resists making the 'experience' of the Spirit the focus, keeping the focus on God's 'determined purpose.'",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Masterful handling of the Law/Gospel distinction.",
      "Authentic, non-sentimental self-revelation.",
      "High theological 'Sache' (God's action for His own name's sake)."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Soften the polemic against 'highbrow' culture to reduce relationship noise.",
      "More concrete application of 'submitting to the Spirit' in modern life.",
      "Ensure the 'Compulsive' drive for correctness doesn't overshadow the 'Depressive' need for pastoral warmth."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively honest and theologically sharp sermon that serves the text more than the preacher's ego."
