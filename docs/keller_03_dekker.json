    "sermon_start_end": "The Bible says that when we become Christians we don’t just turn over a new leaf. We’re spiritually raised with Christ, it says in Ephesians 2. In Philippians 3, Paul says, “I want to know the power of his resurrection.” Jesus Christ’s resurrection power comes into our lives. [...] In the Old Testament God’s holiness is awesome, but in the New Testament God’s holiness in Jesus Christ giving himself away is gorgeous. So look at it until it makes you holy. Let’s pray. Father, we ask only that you’d make us holy, as you are holy."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon focuses on the 1 Peter passage, specifically the command to be holy. However, it quickly moves to general definitions of holiness and relies heavily on external texts (Leviticus, 1 Corinthians, 2 Samuel, Ephesians). It struggles to identify what this specific pericope offers that is unique compared to other texts on holiness.",
      "quotes": [
        "Today we come to a well-known, very important theme and one we have to come to grips with: holiness.",
        "If you want to understand what holiness is, you should notice the quote. Peter quotes... He’s quoting Leviticus."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the specific '1 Peter' flavor of holiness—the tension of being 'foreigners' and 'obedient children'—rather than defaulting to a general biblical-theological study of the word 'holy'."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates knowledge of the original languages (Hebrew 'separate') and the cultic context of Leviticus. The distinction between moral and ceremonial holiness is well-executed, showing the necessary humanities-based background Dekker requires.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Hebrew word originally means separate, set apart.",
        "Leviticus 11 [that Peter quotes] are not given in the context of moral commands... but the context of ceremonial restrictions dealing with clean and unclean things."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exegesis of the specific Petrine context of 'reverent fear' and 'impartial judgment' to avoid the sermon becoming a lecture on Leviticus."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application is somewhat concrete (workplace ethics, New York mindset), but it often veers into general psychological or moral categories. The 'New Yorker' example is a bit of a caricature, lacking the depth of a true analysis of the zeitgeist.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you talk to a typical New Yorker and ask, 'Well, what do you believe?'",
        "When you’re doing your daily job, don’t work for your boss... don’t work according to eye service."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the 'typical New Yorker' trope toward more specific, contemporary struggles with 'holiness' in a secular age, perhaps addressing the specific 'evil desires' of modern life."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a thematic structure (What, How, Why) which tends to separate the 'teaching' from the 'doing'. While there are moments where the hearer is drawn into the text, it remains largely a didactic explanation followed by an application.",
      "quotes": [
        "1. What is holiness? Let’s look at verses 15–16.",
        "2. How does it develop? ... It develops three ways: mind, will, and heart."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the 'three-point' lecture structure. Let the exposition of the text immediately 'expound' the hearer's life in a single movement."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The three parts are clearly present in the background. Misery is defined as the 'claustrophobia of living for ourselves,' redemption as Christ's 'precious blood,' and gratitude as 'delight' in holiness. It avoids being overly objective by focusing on the 'personal' nature of holiness.",
      "quotes": [
        "The claustrophobia of living for ourselves, the crampedness of it, the narrowness of spirit...",
        "You’re a recipient of free grace. Therefore, you are not your own."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The 'misery' part could be sharper. The 'New Yorker' example makes misery seem like a lack of logic rather than a state of being lost before God."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "This is the weakest point. While 'judgment' and 'fear' are in the text, the preacher softens them significantly. The concept of being 'lost' (temporal or eternal) is largely absent, replaced by a focus on 'peace' and 'freedom'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Fathers can be pretty strict... but fathers don’t destroy their children.",
        "This doesn’t mean to be scared that you’re going to be destroyed on the last day."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Take the 'impartial judge' and the 'reverent fear' of the text more seriously. Dekker demands that the possibility of being lost be realized, not explained away as 'not being scared'."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "The sermon is strongly Christocentric. Christ is the telos, specifically through the 'precious blood' and the concept of Christ 'sanctifying himself.' The doctrine of grace is the foundation for the call to holiness.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus Christ’s blood, his sacrificial love, has been shed for you. That’s the key.",
        "To the degree you see him giving himself away for you... to that degree you’ll be able to give yourself away to him."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the connection between Christ's holiness and the believer's holiness is not just an emotional 'motivation' but a dogmatic necessity (participation in Christ)."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "At approximately 2400 words, the sermon meets Dekker's requirement for breadth. It takes time to explore definitions and illustrations, allowing for some theological depth.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Use the available time to explore the 'specific' text more deeply rather than spending significant time on the 2 Samuel 23 illustration."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of didactic preaching but falls short of Dekker's ideal in its handling of the 'two ways' and the specificity of the pericope. It relies heavily on a general biblical-theological framework (holiness as 'set apart') rather than the unique contribution of 1 Peter. The softening of 'fear' and 'judgment' contradicts Dekker's demand for the seriousness of man's destination.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christocentric focus where grace is the engine of the Christian life.",
      "Clear use of original context and linguistic background to define holiness.",
      "Adequate length allows for the 'breadth' required for depth."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 'two ways' are neglected; the preacher actively deconstructs the 'fear' mentioned in the text.",
      "Over-reliance on external biblical examples (David, Paul) at the expense of the specific 1 Peter text.",
      "The didactic structure (1, 2, 3) separates exposition from application."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'good' sermon (6/10) that functions well as a teaching piece, but it lacks the 'proclamatory urgency' and the 'seriousness of the two ways' that Dekker identifies as essential for a sermon to be truly the Word of God."
