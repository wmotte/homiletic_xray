    "sermon_start_end": "Jesus cried with a loud voice, 'Lazarus, come forth!' And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes... and Jesus said to them, 'Loose him, and let him go.' You probably noticed that there is a very unspiritual detail in the story [...] To his infinitely precious children by baptism and the Holy Spirit he says, 'I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and he who lives and believes in me shall never die'. He is the Alpha and the Omega.",
    "notes": "The sermon exhibits a strong Barthian influence, emphasizing the 'Infinite Qualitative Distinction' and God as the sole Acting Subject."

  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The factual content is exceptionally robust, rooted in a 'theology of the Word.' The preacher avoids sentimentalism by focusing on the 'Sache' of death as a biological and theological reality. There is a sophisticated use of historical-critical and dogmatic insights, specifically referencing the 'infinite qualitative distinction' (Kierkegaard/Barth) and the 'American Way of Death' (Mitford). The exegesis of John 11 is not merely a retelling but a dogmatic exploration of Christ as Creator-Word. The 'blue' side is heavy but clear, providing a necessary intellectual foundation for the subsequent proclamation of the Gospel.",

      "comprehensibility_check": "High level of abstraction; requires a congregation with some theological literacy or high attentiveness."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as a seasoned, somewhat traditional priest who values liturgical sobriety. The personal anecdote about his first encounter with a corpse is used diaconally—not to draw attention to his own 'journey,' but to ground the theological 'Sache' in shared human experience. There is a sense of professional gravitas and a slight intellectual elitism ('You are not the average Sunday crowd'). This 'green' signal suggests a personality that finds security in structure and truth rather than emotional rapport.",
      "quotes": [
        "I had never seen a dead body until I was a priest in my mid-thirties.",
        "It is a compliment to this Easter evening congregation that we are talking about such things.",
        "I was not prepared; it was all I could do to perform my task."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive/Schizoid. The preacher values correctness, tradition (Anglican liturgy), and maintains a professional distance from the 'obscene mystery' through structured thought.",
      "diaconal_quality": "High. The 'I' is used to serve the reality of death, not to seek sympathy.",
      "strengths": [
        "Authentic vulnerability regarding his first encounter with death.",
        "Lack of 'pulpit-pathos' or forced emotionality."

        "The 'compliment' to the congregation can be heard as a subtle form of image management (Selbstdarstellung).",

    },
    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher to Advanced Students.' By stating the congregation is 'not the average Sunday crowd,' the preacher creates an 'in-group' feeling, but also sets a high bar for the relationship. The tone is authoritative and paternalistic. The 'yellow' side signals that the preacher expects the congregation to endure the 'stink' of the truth. There is a risk of 'relationship noise' where the preacher's critique of 'tender-minded times' might feel like a reprimand to those currently in deep, raw grief.",
      "quotes": [
        "You, I know, are ready for stronger challenges.",
        "Not so in these tender-minded times.",
        "Believest thou this?"

        "Could benefit from more 'eye-level' solidarity in the face of the 'fell sergeant' Death.",

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The appeal is masterfully handled because it is almost entirely 'Zuspruch' (Promise). The preacher rejects the psychological appeal of 'working on your grief' or 'believing harder.' Instead, the appeal is to recognize the sovereignty of God. The 'red' side is the force of the Gospel itself: the command of Christ that Lazarus (and the hearer) cannot resist. It is a 'healing disruption' that moves from the Law (the finality of death) to the Gospel (the creative Word). The only 'Anspruch' (Demand) is the final, echoing question of faith.",
      "quotes": [
        "Could Lazarus have said 'No!' to Jesus' command?",
        "There can be no true proclamation of the Resurrection until there has been an acknowledgement of the power and the finality of Death.",
        "Believest thou this?"
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The sermon is 90% Zuspruch (God's action) and 10% Anspruch (the response of faith).",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Zero. The sermon is anti-moralistic, emphasizing human helplessness.",
      "strengths": [
        "Theological clarity on the 'Gift' of resurrection.",
        "Avoids 'to-do lists' for the bereaved."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The final question 'Believest thou this?' is so abrupt it may land as a test rather than a comfort."

    "disruptions": "The main disruption is the critique of modern funeral practices, which momentarily shifts the focus from the Gospel to cultural criticism (Relationship Noise).",
    "healing_disruption": "The 'stink' of Lazarus is a healing disruption; it forces the hearer out of 'Corinthian' illusions into the reality where only God can act."

    "the_factual_ear_hears": "A well-reasoned argument for why resurrection is a miracle of creation, not a natural process.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a high-quality homiletical piece that prioritizes the 'Sache' (the matter at hand) over the 'Self.' It is a classic example of the Hamburg school's 'diaconal' self-revelation. The preacher successfully navigates the tension between the psychological reality of grief and the theological reality of the Resurrection. By using the 'Blue' side to dismantle 'Corinthian' optimism, he clears the way for a 'Red' side that is pure Gospel. The sermon is Barthian in its insistence that God is the Subject; Lazarus is passive, and so is the congregation. The communicative power lies in its refusal to be 'nice,' opting instead for 'truth.' However, the high level of abstraction and the slightly paternalistic 'Yellow' signals prevent it from reaching the 'exceptional' 9-10 range. It is a sermon for the head that eventually aims for the heart, but it takes a very long, intellectual route to get there.",
    "barthian_warning": "Low risk. The preacher explicitly warns against 'psychological explanations' and maintains the 'infinite qualitative distinction.'",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological depth and dogmatic consistency.",
      "Effective use of 'Zuspruch' over 'Anspruch'.",
      "Courageous realism regarding the 'stink' of death."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Soften the 'Yellow' side to include more pastoral warmth for the 'tender-minded'.",
      "Reduce the number of literary quotes to allow the biblical text more space.",
      "Bridge the gap between the 'stark terms' and the 'realm of light' with more transition."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, intellectually demanding sermon that maintains high communicative integrity by subordinating the preacher's persona to the sovereignty of the Word."
