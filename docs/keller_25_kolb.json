      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a liturgical reference (Palm Sunday) rather than a specific human experience. While it mentions 'New Yorkers' skin crawl' and the desire for 'spirituality' without demands, these remain somewhat generalized. The emotional connection is primarily intellectual-theological rather than visceral. The 'hook' is the historical significance of the text rather than a 'slice of life' from the hearer's world.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon is strong in analyzing the human condition of wanting a 'God in a box.' It pauses to explore why people prefer an impersonal force over a personal King. It uses cultural analysis (the 'American' desire for choice) to help the hearer understand their resistance to the Gospel. However, it moves relatively quickly into the solution (the Cross) without dwelling extensively on the existential 'why' of the human dilemma.",

The 'big idea'—the conjunction of diverse excellencies—is logically developed and theologically deep. The preacher uses logical argumentation to show why a 'good' God must be both just and merciful.",

It succeeds in providing a deep, logical, and theologically rich exposition of Psalm 110, effectively resolving the tension between God's justice and mercy through the person of Christ. However, it falls short in the 'Concrete Experience' and 'Active Experimentation' phases. The opening is more liturgical than experiential, and the closing application remains at the level of general identity rather than specific ethical action. It serves the 'Assimilating' learner excellently but may leave the 'Accommodating' learner without a clear sense of how to embody the truth in daily life.",

    "conclusion": "This is a well-constructed, intellectually stimulating sermon that provides a high degree of theological clarity. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon—strong on thinking and reflecting, but weaker on feeling and doing. It effectively teaches the 'what' and 'why' of the Gospel but leaves the 'how' largely to the hearer's imagination. To reach a more holistic level of learning, the preacher should focus on bridging the gap between the 'diverse excellencies' of Christ and the 'diverse challenges' of the modern hearer's daily life."
