    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' common in homiletics. By operating primarily from an Adult ego state, the preacher respects the autonomy of the listener. He avoids the 'Critical Parent' trap of moralism by reframing 'Torah' as a delightful reaching out to the vulnerable rather than a list of rigid rules. The focus on 'Open Ears' promotes a healthy, receptive Adult state that is capable of processing new information and changing behavior without the impetus of guilt or fear.",

      "The 'Ain't It Awful' list of societal ills (political, economic, etc.) could be expanded into Adult problem-solving to avoid a brief dip into collective passivity."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'we' pronoun to maintain the Adult-Adult level. Keep emphasizing the 'freedom' of God to prevent the congregation from slipping into a 'Victim' role looking for a 'Rescuer' God."
