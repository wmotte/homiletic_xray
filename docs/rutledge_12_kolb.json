One of my students asked me what my theme would be. I said, “Wrath and judgment!” He laughed. [...] We believe that thou shalt come to be our Judge. We therefore pray thee, help thy servants whom thou hadst redeemed with thy precious blood. Amen.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a personal anecdote and quickly moves to vivid 'word pictures' of Sinai and Zion. It connects the biblical text to modern tragedies (oil spills, cancer, Taliban violence). However, it occasionally leans toward 'listing' experiences rather than deeply immersing the hearer in a single, sustained narrative experience.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher pauses to ask 'What do we make of this?' and explores the 'why' behind human suffering and the nature of the world as 'bent out of shape.' It challenges the common misconception of a 'split' between the Old and New Testament God.",

      "analysis": "The sermon provides a robust theological framework. It engages in careful exegesis of Hebrews, specifically the contrast/link between Sinai and Zion, and the 'better word' of Christ's blood compared to Abel's. The 'big idea'—that God's judgment is the consuming fire that destroys evil to save the good—is logically sustained.",

It excels in Abstract Conceptualization and Reflective Observation, providing the hearer with a robust framework for understanding God's judgment as a necessary component of His love. It uses high-quality literary and theological citations to deepen the 'big idea.' However, the sermon is significantly weaker in the Pragmatic/Active Experimentation phase. While it effectively moves the 'head' and 'heart,' it provides few concrete 'handles' for the 'hands.' The call to action remains largely liturgical and internal, which may leave adult learners who favor the Converging or Accommodating styles without a clear path forward.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a sophisticated theological exploration that successfully reclaims the difficult theme of divine judgment for a modern audience. It is intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant. From a Kolb perspective, it is a highly effective 'Assimilating' sermon. However, its diagnostic priority for improvement is the 'Active Experimentation' phase. To move from a 'good lecture' to a 'transformative learning experience,' the preacher must bridge the gap between the 'unshakeable kingdom' and the 'shakable' daily lives of the parishioners with more concrete, actionable wisdom."
