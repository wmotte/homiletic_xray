    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery effectively but sporadically. It contrasts the 'big splashy occasions' and 'azaleas and hyacinths' of Easter with the 'winter coats' of daily life. The most vivid imagery appears in the biblical citations (the Roman gladiatorial circus) and the personal anecdote of the woman in the wheelchair. However, the preacher often relies on conceptual language ('reorientation of our entire existence', 'sovereign freedom') rather than sustained sensory painting. According to Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell', the sermon leans toward 'telling' the significance of the Resurrection rather than 'showing' the risen life through new metaphors. The imagery of the 'engine' and 'fuel' for the Holy Spirit is functional but somewhat mechanical, lacking the poetic depth found in Cilliers’ 'Space for Grace'.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise and exhibits what McEntyre calls 'stewardship of language'. The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by explaining theological concepts like 'Low Sunday' and 'Apostolic faith' in accessible terms. There is a clear, honest tone that avoids the 'beautifying writing' Grözinger warns against. The use of the phrase 'provincial nonentities' is sharp and intentional, showing a command of nuance. The preacher is careful to distinguish between 'sentiment' (Easter as a spring festival) and 'emotion' (the world-overturning announcement). The transition from the academic 'New Testament witnesses' to the colloquial 'Get over it!' shows a deliberate, though jarring, range of register.",
      "quotes": [

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a strong oral cadence, likely honed through years of liturgical leadership. There is a rhythmic use of repetition ('Tell your children. Tell your grandchildren. Tell your friends.') that builds toward the conclusion. The preacher uses short, punchy sentences ('He did.', 'He is alive.') to punctuate longer, more complex theological reflections. This variation creates a 'legato' for reflection and 'staccato' for proclamation, as recommended in rhetorical studies. The flow is natural, avoiding the 'paper language' of a lecture. The concluding doxology provides a traditional, musical resolution to the tension of the 'Low Sunday' problem.",

    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high level of linguistic stewardship. It avoids the 'kitsch' of flowery Easter language in favor of a sober, precise, and rhythmic proclamation. While it occasionally leans into abstract theological explanation, it grounds these moments in concrete imagery (winter coats, wheelchairs). The preacher’s voice is authoritative yet vulnerable, using language that respects the hearer's intelligence while demanding a 'reorientation' of their reality. It is a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that finds beauty in the clarity of the Word rather than in baroque ornamentation."

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a masterful 'homiletical plot' similar to Eugene Lowry’s model. It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' by addressing the 'twinge of disappointment' of Low Sunday. It moves from the 'problem' (why don't they come back?) to a 'complication' (the Resurrection is only for witnesses/sufferers), and finally to a 'climax' (the personal story of healing). The arc is not a static three-point sermon but a journey from the empty pews of the present to the 'power from on high' in the early church, and back to the congregation's own calling. The tension is sustained by the provocative idea that being 'chosen' is not an 'unmixed blessing'.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a prime example of Cilliers’ 'reframing'. The preacher takes the 'Low Sunday' context—often seen as a liturgical 'hangover'—and reframes it through Acts 10 as a sign of 'chosenness'. The 'strangeness' of the biblical text (that Jesus only appeared to a few) is not smoothed over but used to challenge the modern 'inclusive' or 'universal' assumptions of the hearers. The synthesis of the biblical 'witness' and the contemporary 'Episcopalian' identity is handled with wit and theological depth. The text is not a springboard for the preacher's ideas; rather, the preacher's ideas are clearly submissive to the logic of the Acts narrative.",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is largely an 'open work of art' in its middle section, raising difficult questions about why some believe and others don't. It respects the 'mystery' of God's sovereign freedom. However, the conclusion leans toward a more 'closed' and prescriptive ending ('Tell your children. Tell your grandchildren.'). While the preacher admits to being 'scared' by the healing, the sermon ultimately provides a fairly robust 'answer' to the problem of Low Sunday. It is less 'polyvalent' than Stark might prefer, as it drives toward a specific interpretation of 'witness'. Yet, the admission of 'not knowing' how the healing happened preserves a necessary aesthetic 'gap' for the Holy.",
      "quotes": [
        "You may doubt this, or even be frightened by it, but I invite you to take it seriously.",

        "The ending could benefit from a more 'open' question that leaves the weight of the 'witness' with the hearer.",
        "The explanation of the Holy Spirit as an 'engine' is a very 'closed' metaphor that explains away the mystery."

    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics of the sermon are its greatest strength. The preacher constructs a compelling narrative arc that transforms the congregation's immediate situation (Low Sunday) into a participation in the biblical drama of Acts. The integration of text and context is sophisticated, utilizing 'reframing' to challenge the hearers' perspectives. While the conclusion is somewhat prescriptive, the overall movement from the 'shock' of the Cross to the 'power' of the Spirit is handled with dramaturgical skill, ensuring the 'holy happens' in the moment of proclamation."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a powerful antidote to religious kitsch. It explicitly attacks the 'kitsch' version of Easter (azaleas, hyacinths, spring outfits, and 'vaguely reassuring festivals'). It refuses 'cheap comfort' by emphasizing that the Resurrection is inseparable from the Cross and suffering. The personal story of healing is the ultimate test: in a kitsch sermon, this would be a 'happy ending' formula. Here, the preacher admits it 'scares' her and hasn't happened since, which is an authentic, non-kitsch admission of the 'strangeness' of grace. The sermon sustains the tension between the 'ragtag bunch' and the 'power from on high' without resolving it into a cliché.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential kitsch of 'Easter as a spring festival' is identified and rejected.",

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon creates significant 'Space for Grace' by emphasizing the 'sovereign freedom' of God. It moves the burden of 'faith-making' from the human preacher/hearer to the 'Divine Actor'. By stating that the Resurrection was 'not to all the people' but a gift to the chosen, it opens up a space of wonder and election. The 'inter-esse' (Cilliers) is found in the space between the 'Low Sunday' disappointment and the 'High Sunday' reality of the Spirit. The sermon does not 'seal' the mystery with easy dogmatics but leaves the hearer in the presence of a God who 'acts as he pleases'.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'hiddenness' of the Risen Lord and his 'manifestation' is sustained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the 'different order' of the risen body and the unpredictable nature of the Spirit is highly respected.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "While there is a 'command' to witness, it is framed as a result of having 'ate and drank' with Him (grace) rather than a prerequisite for salvation.",
    "recommendation": "To open even more space, the preacher could allow the 'silence' of the hundreds who didn't come back to speak more loudly before filling it with the 'power' of the Spirit."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of contemporary 'Refining-Reformed' homiletics. Its primary strength lies in its macro-aesthetic structure—specifically its ability to 'reframe' a mundane liturgical reality into a profound theological event. The preacher avoids the 'kitsch' of sentimental Easter rhetoric, opting instead for a 'sober beauty' that honors the Cross. The language is precise and oral, though it occasionally retreats into academic explanation. The inclusion of a 'scary' and 'unrepeatable' miracle story provides a rare moment of authentic aesthetic depth that breaks through the 'sealed' nature of mainline preaching. It successfully creates a 'Space for Grace' by shifting the focus from human attendance to the sovereign initiative of the Risen Christ.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Sophisticated 'reframing' of the 'Low Sunday' context through the lens of Acts 10.",
      "Total avoidance of religious kitsch and sentimentalism.",
      "Strong narrative arc that maintains tension and moves toward a genuine climax."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduce the 'academic' tone in the middle section to maintain the oral rhythm.",
      "Soften the moralistic 'Get over it!' to preserve the 'open work' quality.",
      "Deepen the sensory imagery of the 'eating and drinking' to ground the theology in the body."

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed with Narrative-Dramatic elements.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Four Pages/Imagery), with a touch of Thomas Long (Preacher as Witness).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'clued-in' regular churchgoers who value theological depth, intellectual honesty, and a rejection of superficial 'happy-clappy' religion.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'poetic-imagistic' descriptions of the Risen Life.",
      "Try ending with a more 'open' question to let the 'Space for Grace' linger longer.",
      "Read the text aloud to identify and break up the longer, more complex sentences."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This is a high-quality sermon that functions as a 'witness' rather than a 'lecture'. It succeeds aesthetically because its form (the movement from disappointment to chosenness) perfectly mirrors its content (the Resurrection as vindication for the reeling). It is a model of how to handle 'difficult' or 'dry' liturgical moments by diving deeper into the biblical text's own 'strangeness' rather than trying to 'beautify' the situation with clichés. While it could be more 'open' and 'poetic' in its language, its structural integrity and anti-kitsch stance make it a powerful homiletical event."
