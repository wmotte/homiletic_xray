    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically robust and promotes autonomy. It deconstructs the 'Critical Parent' version of God (the distant, angry judge) and replaces it with a 'Nurturing Parent'/Adult framework. Sölle avoids the common homiletical trap of making the congregation feel like helpless children (Victims) or guilty sinners (Adapted Children). Instead, she uses the Adult ego state to analyze global crises and invites the Free Child to hope and 'dance.' The psychological impact is one of empowerment through reality-testing.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of Adult-to-Adult transparency.",
      "Successful deconstruction of the 'Adapted Child' role in traditional piety.",
      "Inclusion of the preacher's own ego in the critique (prevents NIGYSOB)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The intensity of the 'Ain't It Awful' reality (environmental collapse) could potentially overwhelm the listener's Adult ego if not balanced with more 'Free Child' joy.",
      "Heavy reliance on the 'Adult' might alienate listeners who are currently in a high-distress 'Child' state needing more direct NP comfort."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'we' to maintain the Adult-Adult level. Ensure that the 'prophetic' voice does not slide into 'Critical Parent' by maintaining the vulnerability shown in the personal anecdotes (father's death, childhood fear)."
