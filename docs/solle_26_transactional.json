It deconstructs the 'Critical Parent' image of God that demands submission and replaces it with an 'Adult-Adult' invitation to responsibility. Sölle uses her own 'Child' experiences (fear as a 15-year-old) to build empathy, but remains grounded in an 'Adult' analysis of power structures. She successfully avoids the 'Bait & Switch' of many religious texts by being honest about the 'bitterness' of the Psalm while providing a path to authentic 'Free Child' joy.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to frame 'sin' as 'unconnectedness' (unbezogenheit), as this keeps the dialogue in the Adult sphere of relationship rather than the Parent sphere of moralism."
