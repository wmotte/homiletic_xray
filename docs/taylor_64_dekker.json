  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Psalm 90:17 as a springboard for a general meditation on aging and purpose. It fails to identify what is unique to this specific text. Instead of 'recreating' the Bible passage into a current word, it uses the passage to validate a pre-existing theme of physical vs. spiritual beauty. It imports Psalm 39 and Proverbs to do the heavy lifting.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Bible... pronounces its word upon the departure of our physical beauty and strength in the thirty-ninth psalm."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus exclusively on why Psalm 90—a communal prayer of Moses regarding the eternity of God vs. human transience—specifically asks for 'beauty' (no'am) in the context of 'establishing the work of our hands.' What is in this verse that is not in Psalm 39?"
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is almost no historical-critical or linguistic exegesis. The preacher admits an inability to define the central term ('I cannot pretend to be able to define \"the beauty of the Lord\"'). The original context of Israel's wilderness wandering or the theology of the Psalter is absent. The use of Hebrew/Greek is non-existent.",
      "quotes": [
        "I cannot pretend to be able to define 'the beauty of the Lord,' and interestingly enough, commentators have not spoken widely of this term."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Research the Hebrew 'no'am' (favor/delight/beauty) and its relationship to the sanctuary or the covenant. Ground the 'work of our hands' in the specific historical context of the community's survival."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application is somewhat concrete regarding the 'hair test' and the experience of a hospital stay, but it quickly devolves into general moralisms about 'excellence' and 'high standards.' It lacks the sharp cultural-philosophical analysis Dekker requires.",
      "quotes": [
        "Whatever is worth doing at all... is worth doing well.",
        "Our purpose needs to be to build high standards in our children."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond Victorian-era moralism (excellence/hard work) and apply the text to the specific 'zeitgeist' of modern anxiety regarding productivity and the fear of insignificance."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured as a series of anecdotes and illustrations loosely tied to biblical themes. Exposition and application are not mixed in a movement of revelation; rather, the text is used as a decorative frame for human stories.",
      "quotes": [
        "Along that line, the Bible is not silent. It looks at our human condition..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Instead of starting with mirrors and hospital stories, start with the text's own movement and let the application emerge directly from the linguistic structure of the prayer."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The 'misery' of aging is present but remains largely physical/psychological rather than theological (misery before God). 'Redemption' is equated with 'purpose' and 'excellence,' which risks becoming a new law rather than grace. The Trinitarian background is weak.",
      "quotes": [
        "essentially we are helpless creatures, that is, where the big matters are at stake.",
        "To have purpose, a worthy purpose... is a God-given charge."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the sense of 'misery' to include the theological vanity of human effort apart from God's establishing work. Ensure redemption is seen as Christ's work, not the preacher's call to 'excellence.'"

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are mentioned via Proverbs, but the sermon lacks the 'ultimate possibilities' Dekker demands. The 'lostness' described is mostly the loss of physical attractiveness or a lack of 'purpose,' rather than the radical choice between life and destruction.",
      "quotes": [
        "Drifters know only the awful plunge of Niagara, for the pull or purposelessness is ever downward."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Thematize the 'two ways' in relation to the 'work of our hands'—either it is established by God's beauty, or it is consumed like a moth. Make the choice existential and urgent."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned only at the very end and as an example of prayer, rather than the 'telos' of the sermon. The sermon is more 'Theocentric' in a general sense or even 'anthropocentric' (focused on human purpose) than Christocentric. Grace is mentioned but not developed as the 'deepest of our life.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus ratified that with the words...",
        "prayed their children... toward the Lord Christ."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Show how the 'beauty of the Lord' is specifically revealed in the face of Jesus Christ (2 Cor 4:6). Christ must be the goal that detaches man from his own 'excellence' and points to salvation outside himself."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 16 minutes (1600 words), the sermon falls short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for theological 'depth,' relying on many quotes from poets and playwrights rather than sustained biblical-theological labor.",
      "improvement_point": "Increase the substantive theological weight by engaging more deeply with the exegesis of the Psalm, which would naturally extend the length and depth."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily because it lacks specific exegesis and fails to make Christ the theological telos. It functions more as a moralistic speech on 'purpose' and 'excellence' than a proclamatory word recreated from a specific Bible passage. The use of secondary sources (Shaw, Tennyson, Kierkegaard) often overshadows the primary biblical text.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete illustrations: The 'hair test' and the hospital anecdote provide a tangible connection to human experience.",
      "Clear theme: The contrast between fading physical beauty and the 'beauty of the Lord' is consistently maintained."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specific exegesis: The preacher bypasses the difficult task of defining the text's unique contribution.",
      "Moralism: The application leans heavily on human effort ('excellence,' 'high standards') rather than the radical grace of God.",
      "Weak Christology: Christ is an addendum rather than the center and goal of the proclamation."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the strict Dekkerian sense. It is a topical address about spiritual aging and character building that uses Psalm 90 as a motif rather than as the Word of God that 'expounds' the hearer. It lacks the necessary breadth (duration) and depth (exegesis) to be considered a 'right proclamation of the Gospel.'"
