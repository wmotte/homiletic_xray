    "psychological_health_score": 7,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically robust because it utilizes self-disclosure to level the playing field between preacher and listener. It avoids the typical 'Critical Parent' trap of many religious discourses. However, it flirts with a 'Drama Triangle' by casting the outside world exclusively as a Persecutor (Empire), which can foster a 'Victim' identity in the congregation if not balanced with Adult reality-testing about how to live *within* those systems.",

    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Empire' is a very broad 'Persecutor'—more Adult nuance could help listeners navigate specific ethical dilemmas.",
      "The transition from the Peter/Dorcas miracle to the listener's life is a 'Child' leap that may lack 'Adult' practical steps."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To further strengthen Adult-Adult communication, provide more concrete examples of 'small decisions' that don't just involve church activities, but complex professional or civic choices where the 'Empire' and 'Gospel' are not easily separated."
