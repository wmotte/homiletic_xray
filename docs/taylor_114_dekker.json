On some glad tomorrow, when the morning comes, and all the saints of God are gathered home, we'll meet and tell the story of how we've overcome."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon is primarily a funeral eulogy rather than an exposition of a specific Bible passage. The text (John 17:24) is introduced only in the final third of the speech. It functions as a springboard for comfort rather than the source of the message. It fails to identify what is unique to this text that cannot be found elsewhere.",
      "quotes": [
        "I looked again at the text at John 17:24, which Spurgeon quoted on a Sunday late in March...",
        "The words are the words of Jesus. Who else has a right to speak to us when death has invaded the fields of our affection?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must start with the text rather than the biography of the deceased. The specific 'will' (thelema) of Jesus in John 17 must be the engine of the sermon, not a late-stage ornament."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of Greek/Hebrew study or historical-critical engagement with the Johannine context. The original meaning for the first readers is entirely ignored in favor of a sentimental application to the deceased.",
      "quotes": [
        "\"Father, I will that they be with me.\" There is almost a note here of insistence, of determined demand."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explain the context of the High Priestly Prayer and what it meant for the disciples to 'behold his glory' in the shadow of the cross, rather than jumping immediately to modern funeral imagery."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the life of Sandy Ray and the civil rights context, but it is not an application *of the text*. It is a reflection on a person. The contemporary relevance is limited to the mourning congregation.",
      "quotes": [
        "His unvarying support of every civil rights cause, his sterling record as a champion of the poor and oppressed...",
        "He lived in the earthly metropolis of New York, but he has never seen a city four square..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the specific Johannine promise of 'beholding glory' to the actual struggles of the congregation today, beyond the immediate grief of this one death."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon is bifurcated. The first two-thirds are purely biographical and laudatory. The final third is a brief meditation on the text. There is no 'mixing' where the hearer is drawn into the text; rather, the text is drawn into the service of the eulogy.",
      "quotes": [
        "Supremely, Sandy Ray was a preacher. Our history has not produced his equal.",
        "I have groped through grief for some word to speak to myself as well as to you. I looked again at the text..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The biography of the deceased should be seen *through* the lens of the text from the beginning, rather than standing as a separate monument."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Misery is present as grief, but not as 'misery before God' (sin/alienation). Redemption is treated as a physical 'crossing over' rather than a theological necessity. Gratitude is present as appreciation for a human life, not as a response to the Spirit's work in the face of judgment.",
      "quotes": [
        "We all have a sense of how much has been taken from us.",
        "He passed through Jordan standing up. His Lord kept him away from the fiery arrows."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher should address the 'misery' of death as the 'last enemy' and the judgment of God, which makes the 'will' of Jesus in John 17:24 a matter of radical grace."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are absent. There is an assumption of universal triumph for the deceased. The seriousness of being lost—temporally or eternally—is not addressed, making the salvation described feel automatic rather than a 'narrow way'.",
      "quotes": [
        "He crossed over in full triumph. He crossed over Jordan standing up.",
        "On some glad tomorrow... we'll meet and tell the story of how we've overcome."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Introduce the tension of the 'two ways' by emphasizing that being with Christ is a gift of grace that stands in opposition to the natural 'lostness' of man."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the one who 'wills' and as the 'King of kings', but the sermon is more 'Ray-centric' than Christocentric. Christ serves as the host for Sandy Ray's arrival rather than the telos of the sermon itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "\"Father, I want Sandy now to be with me where I am.\"",
        "He was a leader of the advance guard of the returning King of kings..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Shift the focus from the 'greatness' of the preacher to the 'glory' of Christ that the text actually commands us to behold."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 18 minutes, the sermon falls just short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. More importantly, the 'breadth' is filled with biographical anecdotes rather than theological 'depth'.",
      "improvement_point": "Increase the time spent on the theological implications of the text to reach the 20-minute mark with substantive content."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text falls short of Dekker's definition of a sermon, functioning instead as a high-caliber funeral oration. It lacks specific biblical exposition, fails to engage with the original context of the passage, and prioritizes human biography over the proclamatory Word of God. The 'two ways' and the 'three parts' are largely obscured by sentimentalism and the celebration of a human 'prince'.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete and vivid language regarding the contemporary context of the congregation and the deceased's life.",
      "Effective use of psychological comfort in the face of grief.",
      "Clear, traceable structure in the biographical sections."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The Bible passage is an afterthought, not the starting point.",
      "Total absence of exegetical depth or historical context.",
      "Lack of the 'two ways' perspective; the sermon assumes a triumphalism that ignores the seriousness of being lost.",
      "Christ is relegated to a supporting role in the story of a human hero."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's theses. It is a biographical speech with a biblical postscript. It fails the formal requirement of being 'exposition and application of a specific Bible passage' and the substantive requirement of being about the 'two ways'."
