    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and promotes high levels of autonomy. By identifying 'monologue' as a coercive 'Parent' structure, the preacher gives the congregation 'Permission' (a key TA concept) to move into 'Free Child' expression and 'Adult' processing. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the 'NIGYSOB' game by validating anger and distress as legitimate parts of the human experience rather than sins to be suppressed.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Could incorporate more 'Free Child' spontaneity in delivery style to match the content.",
      "Slightly academic tone may distance those in high emotional distress."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to model the 'cacophony' of voices by sharing personal 'Adult' struggles with the text, ensuring the congregation doesn't turn the 'dialogue' concept into a new 'Parent' rule."
