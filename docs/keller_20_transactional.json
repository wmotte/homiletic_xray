    "risk_explanation": "The only risk is a subtle 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' (ITHY) if the preacher positions himself as the only one who understands the 'true' Gospel, but his self-disclosure about his own marriage and hygiene needs mitigates this."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy because it utilizes the Adult ego state to deconstruct the oppressive Critical Parent (legalism) and the fearful Adapted Child (striving for worth). By framing the Gospel as 'Rest,' the preacher promotes autonomy and reduces the 'games' of religious manipulation. He successfully distinguishes between 'Religion' (a P-C transaction) and 'Gospel' (an A-A or NP-FC transaction).",
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of Adult-Adult reasoning.",
      "Exposes the 'ulterior' motives of legalism.",
      "Promotes the listener's autonomy by offering 'rest' rather than 'new rules'."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Could incorporate more 'Free Child' spontaneity or humor to balance the heavy Adult analysis.",
      "The 'Epic Scale' anger of Jesus could be misinterpreted as Critical Parent if not carefully handled."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using self-disclosure to remain on the same level as the listener, avoiding the 'Preacher-as-Perfect-Parent' trap."
