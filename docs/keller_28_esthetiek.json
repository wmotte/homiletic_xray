Lord, forgive our superficiality. We live in the most superficial age in history, but we ask that you would teach us to become people of character and not just through resolution and hard work and trying to be good.",

    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes strong, concrete imagery to ground its theological claims. Keller effectively employs literary and historical illustrations—such as George MacDonald’s fire of rose petals and William Wallace’s broadsword—to make the abstract concept of 'internal vs. external' sensory. The use of the 'mirror' as a central metaphor for self-perception provides a relatable entry point. However, the imagery is often used as an illustrative 'tool' rather than an organic poetic texture that permeates the entire text. While he 'shows' through these stories, the connective tissue remains largely analytical and expository. The biblical scene of the sons passing by is well-painted, though it relies more on the narrative's inherent drama than on fresh sensory descriptions by the preacher.",
      "quotes": [
        "She has him put his hands in a fire of rose petals, and it burns him. It’s very painful, but when it’s done, he discovers when he takes somebody’s hand he can discern through the outward appearance.",
        "It was a broad sword that was 5 foot 6 inches long. In a day in which most of the warriors he would have been facing would have been about 5 feet 6 inches tall.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Keller exhibits high stewardship of language, characterized by a refusal to hide behind 'Canaanite' jargon. He defines terms like 'primogeniture' and 'internal beauty' through the lens of human experience. His precision is evident in his linguistic analysis of the Hebrew text (e.g., the 'runt' of the litter), which he uses to sharpen the sermon's point rather than to show off scholarship. The language is economical; he avoids flowery adjectives in favor of precise nouns and verbs. He navigates complex cultural critiques (technology, philosophy) with clarity, making dense concepts accessible without oversimplifying them. The tone is intellectual yet pastoral, reflecting a high level of care for how words land on a modern ear.",
      "quotes": [
        "The word literally there is still the smallest, and it’s a Hebrew word that has a kind of negative or pejorative connotation.",
        "Pornography deeply trains you to look at the beauty and the quality of the skin and not the content of the character.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is clearly written for the ear, but its rhythm is more 'conversational-didactic' than 'poetic-musical'. There is a clear cadence in his use of repetition for emphasis ('Don't look at the appearances. Don't look at the externals'). He uses staccato sentences effectively to build tension or drive home a point. However, the structure is heavily dominated by the 'lecture' rhythm—point, explanation, illustration—which lacks the lyrical flow found in more contemplative homiletics. It sounds like a sophisticated conversation rather than a liturgical performance. The ending, quoting C.S. Lewis, provides a much-needed poetic crescendo that the rest of the prose lacks.",

        "Not him. Not him. Not him.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is precise, clear, and intellectually stimulating. It excels in 'stewardship of language' by avoiding jargon and translating ancient concepts into contemporary idioms. While it lacks high poetic musicality, it uses imagery effectively as a didactic tool. The imagery is vivid but often borrowed from literature rather than generated from the preacher's own poetic imagination. It is a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that prioritizes clarity and the 'beauty of simplicity' over baroque decoration."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' through the mirror anecdote, introducing the conflict of self-perception. The movement from the 'importance' to the 'source' and finally the 'secret' creates a sense of progression. There is a palpable tension between the cultural obsession with image and the biblical 'look at the heart'. The turning point occurs in the transition from David to Christ—the 'other child of Bethlehem'. However, the structure is quite explicit (Point 1, 2, 3), which can occasionally feel more like a classroom lecture than a dramatic journey. The energy remains high, but the 'three-point' scaffolding is visible.",
      "quotes": [
        "What do you really look like? ... Actually, believe it or not, as contemporary a column as that is, this passage talks about that.",

        "The transitions between the three main points could be more organic and less 'numbered'.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a hallmark of Keller’s aesthetic: the 'reframing' of reality. He takes the ancient story of David and places it directly into the context of 21st-century New York (Instagram, Spanx, pornography, political debates). The integration feels natural because he identifies the 'perennial relevance' of the heart. He respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the rejection of primogeniture) and uses it to challenge contemporary cultural frames. He doesn't just apply the text; he uses the text to 'unmask' the culture's obsession with externals. The synthesis between the 'runt of the litter' and the 'outsider' status of the gospel is a masterful piece of reframing.",
      "quotes": [
        "Why is Instagram taking over from Facebook? Because I’d rather send a picture than read or even write a text.",
        "New Yorkers like to say, 'Well, yeah. California. They are really obsessed with looks... but honestly, that’s just as superficial.'",
        "David is a kind of male Cinderella left to the domestic chores instead of being invited to the party."

        "Brilliant 'reframing' of the biblical narrative to critique modern secular values.",
        "Surprising connections between Hebrew scholarship (Robert Alter) and modern social media habits.",
        "The application flows organically from the 'reversal' logic found in the text."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The section on technology/philosophy feels slightly detached from the David narrative at times.",
        "Could include more specific 'contextual' examples of 'inner beauty' in the workplace or city life.",
        "Ensure the 'reframing' doesn't become a predictable 'culture-is-wrong-gospel-is-right' formula."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes, the sermon offers a new frame (the 'reversal of values') to view both the self and the culture."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is intellectually 'open'—inviting the hearer to reconsider their worldview—it is structurally quite 'closed'. Keller provides a very clear, almost airtight, theological solution. The 'secret' is explicitly revealed as the substitutionary work of Christ. While this is dogmatically sound, it leaves less room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or for the hearer to sit with the mystery of God’s choice. The use of the C.S. Lewis quote at the end provides a beautiful, imaginative opening, but the preceding analysis is highly prescriptive. It functions more as a 'closed system of truths' (Stark) that are brilliantly argued, rather than an 'open work of art'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Here is true beauty and the only kind of true beauty that will change you.",
        "Only when you see him doing all of that for you... only that can destroy... your need to appear great.",
        "Lord, would you do this for me?"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The C.S. Lewis illustration at the end opens up the imagination to the 'not yet' of heaven.",
        "The sermon invites the hearer into a process of 'detecting and developing' rather than just a one-time fix.",
        "Acknowledges the difficulty of the task ('You're going to need a lot more than [a resolution]')."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Allow more space for the 'silence' of God in the choosing process—why David and not Eliab?",
        "End with a more evocative question rather than a summary prayer.",
        "Reduce the use of 'only' and 'must' to allow for more polyvalent appropriation."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent: The sermon leads to a single, clear theological conclusion, though the final image provides a window of openness."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is strong, moving from a relatable human problem to a profound theological solution. The integration of text and context is the sermon's greatest structural strength, successfully 'reframing' modern life through the ancient text. However, the structure is somewhat rigid and didactic, following a clear 'three-point' logic that prioritizes clarity over mystery. It is a 'Narrative-Dramatic' structure that ultimately resolves into a 'Sober-Reformed' dogmatic conclusion."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully avoids religious kitsch. It does not offer 'cheap comfort' or 'pre-chewed emotions'. Instead, it addresses the 'pain of suffering' and the 'ugliness' of the cross. Keller explicitly critiques the 'happy ending' mentality by pointing out that David will go on to do 'terrible things'. The sermon avoids the 'sentiment' of 'God loves you just as you are' by replacing it with the 'emotion' of 'Christ lost his beauty so you could be beautiful'. The use of the 'runt' metaphor and the 'marred visage' of Christ provides an authentic aesthetic depth that resists the 'polish' of kitsch.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'Flawless' movement/Spanx discussion is used to illustrate cultural kitsch, though the sermon itself avoids it.",
      "Potential kitsch in the 'happy younger men and women dancing' in the Lewis quote, though it is framed as a parable of holiness."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of Christ being 'beaten to a pulp' on the cross as the source of true beauty.",
      "The admission that 'we are not doing' what we know we ought to do—the 'mystery of the ages'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the focus on the 'marred' beauty of the cross to ensure the sermon never slides into superficial sentimentality."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'reversal' theme. By showing that God chooses the 'runt' and the 'outsider', Keller creates a 'space for grace' that is unavailable to the 'strapping' and the 'successful'. However, the space is somewhat narrowed by the highly analytical 'how-to' approach in the third point. The 'mystery' of the Spirit 'rushing through' David is explained as a theological mechanism rather than left as a divine event. Nevertheless, the emphasis on grace as a 'gift' rather than a 'task' (moralization) ensures that the vertical dimension remains the primary focus.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between 'already' and 'not yet' are sustained through the Sarah Smith illustration.",
    "mystery_respected": "Partially; the 'choosing' of God is explored, but the 'how' is explained quite thoroughly.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the sermon explicitly rejects 'trying harder' or 'New Year's resolutions'.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'mystery' of the Spirit's work to breathe more by using less analytical language in the final section."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'Sober-Reformed' homiletics with a 'New Homiletic' emphasis on imagery and narrative. Its primary aesthetic power lies in its intellectual clarity and its ability to 'reframe' contemporary reality. It avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by grounding its 'beauty' in the 'ugliness' of the cross. While it lacks the high poetic musicality of a more liturgical style, it compensates with a profound stewardship of language and a compelling narrative arc. The sermon functions as an 'event' of perception, teaching the hearer to 'see' themselves and their culture through a different lens. It is more 'didactic-dramatic' than 'contemplative-poetic', prioritizing the 'witness' of the preacher to the truth of the text.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful integration of contemporary cultural context with the biblical narrative (Reframing).",
      "Avoidance of religious kitsch through the 'theology of the cross'.",

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The structural scaffolding (Point 1, 2, 3) is too visible and didactic.",

    "audience_analysis": "Urban, educated, and skeptical hearers who are aesthetically appealed to by intellectual rigor and cultural relevance.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more organic, less numbered structure.",
      "Incorporate more sensory details from the biblical world to balance the literary illustrations.",
      "Use more 'open' endings that leave the hearer in the 'mystery' of the text."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a highly effective aesthetic work that achieves its goal of 'reframing' the hearer's perception of beauty. It is a model of how to use language carefully and how to integrate 'then' and 'now' without falling into anachronism or cliché. While it leans heavily on its didactic structure, its authentic depth and 'space for grace' make it a compelling homiletic event. It is a 7.5: a strong, well-crafted sermon that excels in intellectual and contextual aesthetics."
