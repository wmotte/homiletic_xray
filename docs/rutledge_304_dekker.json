I must admit that I was staggered by that. This is the thought that ran through my mind: What is the use [...] May you be granted such an abundance of gifts that, through you, Christ our Lord may yet do such great things with this congregation that we cannot presently even imagine them, by the great might of his Holy Spirit. Amen."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on a single pericope. While 1 Corinthians 2:12-13 is the header, the preacher drifts into Genesis 1, John 14, John 16, John 3, 1 John 4, Romans 5, and 1 Corinthians 12. It becomes a thematic speech about the Holy Spirit rather than an exposition of what is unique to the 1 Corinthians 2 passage.",

      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is almost no historical-critical or linguistic exegesis of the primary text. The preacher mentions the Greek word 'apostolos', but this is not even in the primary text (1 Cor 2:12-13). The original context of the Corinthian crisis regarding 'wisdom' is ignored.",
      "quotes": [
        "The word apostolos, in Greek, means 'one who is sent.'"

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is interwoven, but because the 'exposition' is actually a thematic survey of many texts, the movement is more of a topical lecture than a text-driven actualization.",

      "findings": "Misery is present in the form of 'feckless disciples' and the potential 'fraud' of the church, but it is somewhat superficial. Redemption is tied to the Spirit's power. Gratitude is framed as 'gifts for the common good.'",

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher introduces a sharp choice: either the Spirit is real and the church is apostolic, or the building should be closed. This touches on the 'temporal loss' Dekker mentions.",

  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily due to its lack of focus on a specific Bible passage and its insufficient length. It functions as a topical teaching on the Holy Spirit rather than an exposition of 1 Corinthians 2. While it successfully avoids 'general truths' by addressing the local context and the zeitgeist of the 1990s, it sacrifices exegetical depth for a broad biblical survey.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete local application to the Salisbury congregation.",
      "Strong Trinitarian and Christocentric grounding of the Holy Spirit.",
      "Direct confrontation with the 'seriousness' of the faith's truth-claims (Thesis 6)."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Fragmented focus; uses too many disparate Bible passages.",
      "Lack of rigorous exegesis of the Greek/Hebrew context of the primary text.",
      "Duration is significantly below the 20-minute minimum required for depth."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate thematic address, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict sense defined by Dekker. It lacks the specific 'recreation' of a single Bible passage into a current proclamatory word and fails the formal requirement of length."
