  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Judges 6 and Luke 5 as parallel illustrations of a theme (fear/grace) rather than mining the unique particularity of one text. It functions more as a thematic speech on 'the fear of the Lord' than an exposition of what can be found 'nowhere else' in the Judges pericope.",
      "quotes": [
        "The motif of 'the fear of the Lord' appears so many times in the Bible, however, that it requires very fancy footwork to keep out of its way.",
        "Today we have two readings about the fear of the Lord, one from the Old Testament and one from the New."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus exclusively on the Gideon narrative to find its unique 'scandal.' Why fire from a rock? Why a staff? Avoid diluting the specific text with general biblical cross-references."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher shows awareness of the historical context (Midianite oppression) and the literary nature of the text (the 'funny' aspect of Gideon's calling). However, the exegesis is subservient to the psychological theme of fear rather than driving the theology.",
      "quotes": [
        "Being an Israelite during the invasions of the Midianites must have been a little like being a Kurd in Iraq.",
        "Notice that, in the Old Testament, 'the angel of the Lord' is equivalent to the Lord himself."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the linguistic and theological tension of the 'Alas' (v. 22). The exegesis should expose the specific Hebrew concept of 'seeing God' as a death sentence more sharply."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is concrete, utilizing cultural references (New Yorker, Hitchcock, Annie Dillard) and specific human situations (the injured man, the subway). It avoids 'bland, inoffensive' generalities.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are all seriously sick patients in the hospital, swearing at those who would help us...",
        "while we are about our mundane daily lives, cleaning our nets, threshing our wheat, doing our income tax, riding the subway..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application remains tied to the specific text's movement rather than becoming a general psychological profile of 'modern man.'"
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a somewhat traditional 'story-explanation-application' structure. The exposition of Gideon is a block in the middle, followed by a block on Peter, then a concluding application. The 'mixing' Dekker demands is limited.",
      "quotes": [
        "The story begins with the Midianites...",
        "What is it about the appearance of God that causes dread?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Interweave the 'Kurd in Iraq' or 'hospital ward' imagery directly into the reading of the Judges text so the hearer is 'expounded' alongside Gideon."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "This is a strong point. The sermon takes 'misery' (terror, sin, being 'messed up') seriously and links it to 'redemption' (grace, 'Fear not') and 'gratitude' (the blessing of holy dread). It avoids being 'too Christocentric' by grounding it in the human condition before God.",
      "quotes": [
        "God is opposed to us; he is opposed to our selfishness, greed, idolatry...",
        "The awareness of sin comes only to those who are already standing on the firm ground of their salvation."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this balance but ensure 'misery' isn't just psychological 'sickness' but specifically 'misery before God' as in the Catechism."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon explicitly addresses the possibility of being 'lost' and the 'horrific' nature of judgment. It takes the destination of man seriously, though it leans toward the 'temporal loss' (being rolled into the dark) rather than eternal destruction.",
      "quotes": [
        "If your rebelliousness and mine were allowed to play themselves out to the end, we would have our beds rolled out into the dark forever and ever...",
        "The perfect justice of God would require that each of us be condemned."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'two ways' a more central choice for the hearer in the moment of the sermon, rather than a theoretical outcome of 'rebelliousness.'"
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, but he appears somewhat late and as a 'combination' of attributes. The sermon risks being a general 'theism of terror' until the final sections.",
      "quotes": [
        "Perfect justice and unconditional love are combined in the person of Jesus Christ...",
        "He is for us in ways that we can scarcely imagine — indeed, could not imagine if he had not revealed his conquering love in Jesus Christ."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Show how the 'fire from the rock' in Judges is specifically a Christological moment, rather than treating Christ as the 'New Testament version' of the theme."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 19.5 minutes (1950 words), the sermon sits right on the edge of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. It risks lacking the 'breadth' required for true 'depth.'",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section to allow the text to breathe more before jumping to contemporary illustrations."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily by being a thematic speech on 'the fear of the Lord' rather than a specific exposition of the Judges pericope. It uses the Bible as a source of illustrations for a theological concept. However, it succeeds in its sharp, non-sentimental treatment of human misery and the 'terror' of grace, avoiding the 'bland' theology Dekker loathes.",
    "strengths": [
      "Theologically sharp treatment of 'misery' and 'terror' without softening the blow.",
      "Concrete, contemporary application that avoids religious jargon.",
      "Strong sense of the 'two ways' and the seriousness of the human condition."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Thematic rather than text-specific; the 'Gideon' part could be swapped for any epiphany text without changing the sermon's core.",
      "Structural separation of exposition and application.",
      "Duration is slightly below the threshold for 'depth' according to Thesis 8."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate piece of theological rhetoric that approaches the status of a sermon, but it remains too much a 'speech about a biblical idea' to fully satisfy Dekker's formal definition."
