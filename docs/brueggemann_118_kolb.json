      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience through historical and contemporary examples of peacemakers. However, it lacks a singular, immersive narrative 'hook' that places the hearer directly inside a specific situation. It relies more on lists of recognizable figures than on a deep, sensory 'slice of life' that evokes immediate empathy.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of prophetic-visionary preaching that excels in Reflective Observation and Abstract Conceptualization. It effectively deconstructs the 'normalcy' of a violent world and reconstructs a theological vision of peace rooted in justice and the power of the Spirit. It falls short in the Active Experimentation phase, largely due to the preacher's rhetorical choice to 'not recruit' or 'urge' the congregation. This creates a gap between the powerful vision presented and the hearer's ability to implement it. The sermon serves the 'Assimilating' and 'Diverging' learners well but provides less for the 'Converging' learner who seeks practical utility. The language is evocative and the structure is clear, but the lack of a concrete ethical call limits its impact on the 'Hands' of the hearer.",

      "Experiment with a more 'Pragmatic' role (Guide/Coach) in the final third of the sermon."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a sophisticated theological reflection that successfully moves the hearer from a state of 'weary despair' to 'prophetic imagination.' It is particularly strong in its interpretive and normative tasks, offering a compelling vision of God's intended world. However, from a Kolb perspective, the cycle remains incomplete. The preacher’s reluctance to 'recruit' results in a sermon that is high on inspiration and insight but low on implementation. For this to be a model sermon for adult learning, it would need to bridge the gap between the 'vision of the wolf and lamb' and the 'Monday morning' reality of the hearer through more concrete, pragmatic guidance. The priority for improvement is the development of the Active Experimentation phase."
