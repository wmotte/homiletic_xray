    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and promotes high levels of autonomy. It avoids the common 'guilt-trip' trap of the Critical Parent and instead uses the Adult ego state to analyze systemic oppression. By identifying with the 'Free Child' (singing and praying in prison), the preacher invites the congregation into a state of authentic joy rather than fearful compliance. The transition from the 'jailer' as a victim of the system to a liberated agent of hospitality is a classic TA move toward 'I'm OK, You're OK.'",

      "Strong Adult-to-Adult address that respects the listener's intelligence.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The Critical Parent judgment of 'talk-show fortune tellers' and 'media stars' could be seen as a slight 'Ain't It Awful' game if the audience is already prone to elitism.",
      "Ensure the 'we' in 'What a strange bunch we are' doesn't become a closed-circle 'Nurturing Parent' smothering."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to offer the 'alternative reading of reality' as a choice for the Adult ego state, rather than a moral imperative from the Critical Parent."
