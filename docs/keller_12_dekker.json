The Lord’s Prayer is so packed that every single phrase is actually talking about another kind of prayer, another way of praying. [...] The cross gives us a God who says, “I lost a child too,” voluntarily, not involuntarily, to save you. Spafford is looking at the cross, and that reorders the loves of his heart. He says, “If you’ve done this for me, there is nothing in heaven or on earth that I love more than you.” When you can say that, nothing will cast you down. Let us pray."

    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher uses Psalm 73 as a primary example. However, the sermon is framed by the Lord's Prayer ('Lead us not into temptation'), making the Psalm a secondary illustration of a general 'kind of prayer' rather than the absolute starting point. It fails the 'nowhere else' test by treating the Psalm as a generic case study for spiritual depression.",
      "quotes": [
        "What we’ve been doing each week is going to some part of the Bible that gives you an example of that kind of prayer"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Anchor the sermon entirely in the unique logic of Psalm 73's movement from envy to the sanctuary, rather than using it to illustrate a petition from the Lord's Prayer."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher correctly identifies the 'sanctuary' as the Temple in Jerusalem and notes the shift from third-person to first-person address. However, there is no engagement with the original Hebrew or the specific theological history of Israel's wisdom literature. The exegesis is functional but thin.",
      "quotes": [
        "He says, 'I went into the sanctuary of God.' That’s the temple in Jerusalem.",
        "Before verse 17, God is always spoken of in the third person... after verse 17, God is spoken to in the first person."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the analysis of the 'sanctuary' by exploring the cultic theology of the Presence of God in Israel's history, rather than jumping immediately to a psychological 'vantage point'."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is strong in its psychological depth, particularly regarding envy and the 'marketing' culture. It avoids vague moralism by identifying the specific 'beast-like' nature of human instinct. It addresses the zeitgeist of careerism and success in a urban (New York) context.",
      "quotes": [
        "Partly because of marketing, partly because all advertisement is based on envy, we don’t see envy as terrible as it really is.",
        "We get so scared if our career isn’t so good or if somebody doesn’t like us or if this is bad or we put on weight."

      "improvement_point": "Move beyond individual psychology to include the collective 'lostness' in time (politics/society) that Dekker emphasizes."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a thematic structure (4 points) which tends to separate the text's movement from the hearer's life. While the preacher attempts to draw the hearer into the 'sanctuary' experience, the structure remains somewhat didactic.",
      "quotes": [
        "There are four things. I’d like to spend the rest of our time looking at these four things."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Allow the narrative arc of the Psalm to dictate the sermon's flow, merging the 'then' of the text with the 'now' of the congregation more fluidly."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "This is a strong point. The preacher explicitly identifies the 'misery' (envy, using God), 'redemption' (the cross, grace), and 'gratitude' (reordered loves). It avoids over-objectification by making the hearer the subject of this movement.",
      "quotes": [
        "He admits the worst... He grasps God’s grace... He reorders the loves of his heart.",
        "The reason I’ve been living this good life is because I thought it would pay off... essentially, my goodness was really quite selfish."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'misery' is not just psychological but also theological—the 'lostness' before God's judgment."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon takes the 'final destiny' of the wicked seriously, using the dream metaphor to show the 'slippery ground' of a life without God. It contrasts this with being 'received into glory'.",
      "quotes": [
        "If the only wealth and the only happiness and the only power you have is in this life... it’s all going to be swept away.",
        "You place them on slippery ground. You cast them down to ruin."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, specifically through the substitutionary atonement on the cross. The preacher links the Old Testament sanctuary to Christ as the true Temple. However, the 'two natures' doctrine is implied rather than substantively present.",
      "quotes": [
        "I’m the temple. I am the bridge between heaven and earth, and I am the final bloody sacrifice.",
        "Jesus got the punishment you deserve so that when you do the things you do... he holds you by your right hand."

      "improvement_point": "Explicitly ground the 'bridge' metaphor in the doctrine of the two natures to provide more substantive theological weight."

      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "With an estimated duration of 34 minutes, the sermon provides the 'breadth' Miskotte and Dekker demand. It allows for the necessary repetition and psychological exploration to achieve depth.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this length but increase the density of the 'exposition' (Thesis 2) within that time."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a robust example of practical-theological preaching that aligns well with Dekker's 3-2-1 rule. It falls short primarily in its formal starting point—using the Bible passage as an illustration for a topical series rather than letting the specific text be the sole master. The exegesis lacks the linguistic and historical rigor Dekker expects from a 'bicycle mechanic' of the Word.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong integration of the three parts (misery, redemption, gratitude) without being moralistic.",
      "Effective use of psychological insight to 'undo the theft' of the church's space by secular psychology.",
      "Clear Christocentric telos that moves toward grace as the final word."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Theological 'prior knowledge' (the Lord's Prayer series) burdens the text rather than letting the text 'sleep' and speak for itself.",
      "Lack of engagement with original languages and specific biblical-theological context of the Psalter.",
      "The 'nowhere else' uniqueness of Psalm 73 is slightly obscured by general spiritual principles."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition, particularly in its seriousness regarding the human condition and the necessity of grace. It is a 'good' sermon (6.5/10) that would become 'strong' by shedding its topical framing and deepening its exegetical labor."
