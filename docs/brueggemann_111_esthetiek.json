    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon relies heavily on the biblical metaphor of the shepherd and sheep, which is inherently sensory. Brueggemann (or the preacher) effectively uses the 'vivid scenes' of Ezekiel 34 to contrast the 'fat' of the kings with the 'weak' and 'crippled' sheep. While the preacher doesn't invent many new metaphors, he 're-activates' the biblical ones by placing them in a modern political context. The imagery of 'unraveling fabric' at the start provides a tactile sense of societal decay. However, the contemporary application remains somewhat abstract (referencing 'arms' and 'economic policy') rather than painting sensory pictures of modern 'sheep'. The strength lies in the 'painting' of the biblical indictment, which forces the hearer to see the neglect.",
      "quotes": [
        "You eat the fat. You clothe yourself with the wool. You slaughter the fatlings, but you do not feed the sheep.",
        "I will bind up the crippled. I will strengthen the weak.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and avoids 'Canaanite' jargon. The preacher defines terms carefully, such as the biblical definition of 'justice' (getting what one needs to live, not what one deserves). This is a prime example of McEntyre’s 'stewardship of language'. The preacher is careful to navigate the liberal/conservative divide by using language that transcends partisan clichés, focusing instead on 'sovereignty' and 'public practice'. Every word feels weighed, especially the distinction between 'illusion' and 'reality'. The tone is scholarly yet accessible, maintaining a high level of intellectual integrity without becoming academic.",
      "quotes": [
        "It does not mean that one gets what one deserves. Rather it means that one gets what one needs in order to live.",
        "This is not a sermon that is liberal or conservative... I have in mind a different aim.",

        "The analogy of the 'Presbytery declaring a pastoral vacancy' is very denomination-specific and might obscure the point for outsiders.",
        "Ensure the 'Ho, shepherds' vs 'Hey, kings' distinction doesn't come across as overly folksy."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Religious jargon is almost entirely absent; where theological concepts like 'sovereignty' are used, they are immediately contextualized in public life."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a strong rhetorical cadence, particularly through the use of parallelism and repetition. The 'I will' litany from Ezekiel is used as a rhythmic heartbeat in the middle of the sermon, creating a sense of divine momentum. There is a clear variation in sentence length—short, punchy assertions ('I, the Lord, have spoken') are followed by longer, more reflective periods. The use of the three-point question structure at the end creates a staccato-like urgency. It is clearly 'oral language', designed to be heard and felt as a 'decree from the throne'.",
      "quotes": [
        "I will seek out my sheep. I will rescue them. I will bring them back. I will feed them.",
        "Ho, shepherds. Hey, kings.",

        "More use of alliteration or assonance could heighten the poetic quality of the 'Space for Grace' sections."

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The sermon demonstrates a high level of micro-aesthetic quality. It avoids the 'kitsch' of sentimental religious language in favor of a sober, precise, and rhetorically rhythmic prose. The imagery is deeply rooted in the biblical text, though it occasionally leans toward abstract sociological analysis in its contemporary application. The stewardship of language is evident in the careful redefinition of 'justice,' ensuring the form of the message—sober and challenging—matches its content. It is a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that values the weight of the Word over baroque decoration."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear, logical progression, but it is more of a 'thematic argument' than a 'narrative plot'. It begins by upsetting the equilibrium (the 'unraveling' of the Christian nation), which creates tension. However, the structure then settles into a somewhat static three-point exposition of Ezekiel 34. The 'turning point' is the introduction of Jesus as the 'new David', but this feels more like a theological necessity than a dramatic climax. The movement is from 'indictment' to 'alternative' to 'implementation', which provides a journey, but the energy remains fairly level throughout rather than building to a crescendo.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now that congruity and that convergence are coming apart.",
        "Yahweh declares the throne vacant and rules directly.",
        "The question pounds at Peter and at us. It asks, 'Are you serious? Will you obey?'"

        "Logical flow from the problem (bad shepherds) to the solution (God as shepherd) to the embodiment (Jesus).",
        "The conclusion successfully circles back to the 'sheep' metaphor via John 21."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The three-point structure feels a bit like a classroom lecture; it could be more 'plotted' as a discovery.",
        "The transition to the 'David' section (Point 3) is a bit abrupt and could use more narrative tension.",
        "Increase the dramatic stakes in the middle section—make the 'pastoral vacancy' feel more like a cosmic event."

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. Cilliers' concept of 'reframing' is perfectly executed here. The preacher takes the ancient, 'strange' text of Ezekiel and uses it as a mirror for 1980s America. The 'reframing' occurs when the hearer is forced to look at national policy not through the lens of 'liberal vs. conservative' but through the lens of 'shepherd vs. sheep'. The synthesis is organic; the preacher doesn't 'use' the text as a springboard but allows the text's own categories (justice, greed, fear) to interrogate the contemporary context. It respects the 'strangeness' of the 'dreadful voice of Yahweh'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now if we listen to this text, it may become a hint or a mirror of what is wrong among us.",
        "It is rather a matter of deciding if the ways of this shepherd God apply to public life.",
        "The real question of patriotism is, 'Do you love me?'"

        "Masterful 'reframing' of political issues into theological/biblical categories.",
        "The connection between the 'Fourth of July' and Ezekiel's 'Ho, shepherds' is surprising and effective.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The mention of the 'Catholic Bishops' letters' dates the sermon; a more timeless contextual connection could be made.",
        "The 'Presbytery' analogy is a bit of a 'clash' with the high-stakes imagery of Ezekiel.",
        "Could explore the 'strangeness' of the exile context more to deepen the parallel with the 'unraveling' of America."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes; it successfully reframes 'patriotism' as 'obedience to the Shepherd' rather than nationalistic pride."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon is an 'open work of art' in the sense that it explicitly refuses to provide 'precise conclusions' or partisan answers. By framing the conclusion as three questions, the preacher invites the hearer to step into the space of interpretation. However, the theological 'decree' is quite firm, which creates a tension between the 'openness' of the application and the 'closedness' of the biblical indictment. It acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (the crisis of the Christian American), but the call to 'feed the sheep' is a clear imperative. It treats the hearer as a 'mature conversation partner'.",
      "quotes": [
        "I do not urge you to my precise conclusion. I only propose that those questions come out of the text.",
        "I want to set your mind at ease. This is not a sermon that is liberal or conservative.",
        "Now we are having to decide if God’s sovereignty is true."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The use of questions at the end leaves room for the hearer's own appropriation.",
        "Explicit refusal to be 'liberal or conservative' opens space for listeners from across the spectrum.",
        "The sermon ends with an invitation to 'public way' rather than a moralistic checklist."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'I, I, I' of the divine decree can feel a bit 'sealing' if not balanced with more human struggle.",
        "The conclusion could be even more open—perhaps ending on the question 'Do you love me?' without the immediate explanation.",
        "Ensure the 'three questions' don't feel like a 'rhetorical trap' where only one answer is possible."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Polyvalent; it allows for different political applications while remaining monovalent on the theological demand for justice."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is strong, characterized by a masterful integration of text and context. The sermon functions as a 'reframing' device, shifting the hearer's perspective from nationalistic anxiety to biblical sovereignty. While the narrative arc is more intellectual than dramatic, the structure is purposeful and leads to an open-ended conclusion that respects the hearer's agency. It avoids the 'closed' nature of moralistic preaching by focusing on the 'event' of God's sovereign speech, creating a space where the 'holy happens' through the interrogation of public values."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a powerful antidote to religious kitsch. It explicitly rejects 'pre-chewed emotions' and 'cheap solutions'. There is no 'happy ending' or sentimental appeal to 'God's love' that ignores the 'stench' of injustice. The preacher specifically warns against 'vested interest' and 'fear'—the primary drivers of religious kitsch. By focusing on the 'dreadful voice' of Yahweh and the 'crisis' of the nation, the sermon maintains an authentic aesthetic depth. It sustains the tension of the 'unraveling' without offering a quick fix. This is 'sober beauty' at its best.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None present; the sermon actively deconstructs the kitsch of 'Christian America'.",
      "The refusal to use 'patriotic' clichés on a 'Sunday of Patriotism' is a strong anti-kitsch move."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission that 'we cannot any longer claim to be a Christian nation'—a moment of painful honesty.",
      "The definition of justice as 'getting what one needs' rather than a sentimental 'fairness'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Continue to resist the urge to provide 'comfort' too quickly; the strength of this aesthetic is its 'dreadful' honesty."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens a significant 'Space for Grace' by clearing away the clutter of 'illusion' and 'fear'. According to Cilliers, grace requires the end of our own 'systems'. By declaring the 'throne vacant' and letting God rule, the sermon creates a space where God's agency is primary. The 'grace' here is not a 'cheap grace' but the 'sovereign grace' that intervenes for the weak. The tension between the 'already' of Jesus' ministry and the 'not yet' of our public policy is sustained throughout. It respects the mystery of God's 'odd notion of justice'.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes; the tension between 'loyal American' and 'faithful Christian' is left as a living problem for the hearer.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes; the 'dreadful voice' of God is allowed to remain sovereign and somewhat 'other'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails as divine agency ('I will...'), though it leads to a clear ethical imperative ('Feed my sheep').",
    "recommendation": "To increase space, perhaps spend more time on the 'wonder' of the new David's kingdom to balance the 'indictment' of the old kings."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.7,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the 'prophetic-imagistic' style. Its primary strength lies in its ability to 'reframe' contemporary political and social reality through the 'strange' and 'dreadful' lens of the Ezekiel text. The language is characterized by a 'stewardship' that is both precise and rhetorically powerful, avoiding the pitfalls of religious kitsch and sentimentalism. While the structure leans toward the traditional three-point model, it is infused with a dramaturgical tension derived from the 'unraveling' of the American civil religion. The sermon successfully creates a 'Space for Grace' by deconstructing the hearer's 'illusions' and 'fears,' replacing them with the sovereign 'I will' of God. It is an 'open work' that invites the hearer into a new 'public way' without forcing a partisan conclusion. The aesthetic is one of 'sober beauty'—it does not seek to please but to 'witness' to a reality that unsettles the routine.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful integration and 'reframing' of text and context.",
      "Exceptional 'stewardship of language' and precision in defining theological concepts.",
      "Complete absence of religious kitsch, maintaining authentic aesthetic depth."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The narrative arc could be more 'plotted' and less 'thematic/logical'.",
      "Contemporary imagery could be more sensory and 'shown' rather than 'told'.",

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Reframing (Sober-Reformed)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Thomas G. Long (Preacher as Witness).",
    "audience_analysis": "Intellectually engaged hearers who are struggling with the tension between faith and national identity; those who appreciate 'sober' rather than 'emotional' preaching.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'Lowry-esque' plot that delays the 'answer' even further.",
      "Use more 'cinematic' language to describe the 'blind seeing' and 'lame walking' in a modern city.",
      "Maintain the high anti-kitsch standard while exploring more 'poetic' (rather than just 'precise') language."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Through the lens of homiletic aesthetics, this sermon is a high-quality 'event' of the Word. It avoids the 'beautifying writing' that Grözinger warns against, instead allowing the 'form' of the divine decree to dictate the 'content' of the sermon. It is a successful 'performance' of the prophetic voice, creating a space where the 'holy happens' not in a private emotional experience, but in the 'unsettling' of public routine. It is a model of how to use biblical imagery to break through fixed cultural frames."
