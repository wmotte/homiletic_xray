A voice had said to him: “What God has made clean, you must not call profane.” (Acts 11:9) The voice that haunted summoned Peter to depart in radical ways [...] The peace of Jerusalem for which we pray will consist in an open-ended venture of great imagination and daring. No more putting the wagons in a circle!",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a biblical narrative (Peter's vision) rather than a contemporary life situation, which slightly distances the immediate experience. However, it attempts to bridge this through the anecdote of the 'cranky critic' from England. While this provides a moment of humor and recognition, the 'feeling' level remains intellectualized. The identification with the 'fear and hostility' of the early church is stated but not vividly dramatized to evoke deep empathy in the hearer.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher effectively analyzes the tension between tradition and innovation. He pauses to explore the 'why' behind the conflict in Acts 15, identifying the human desire for 'certitude' and 'control by rule and regulation.' He provides a cultural critique by juxtaposing the 'peace' of Psalm 122 with the 'disruption' of the apostolic mission, forcing the hearer to reflect on their own definitions of peace.",

      "analysis": "The theological 'big idea' is clear: the 'Apostolic Adventure' requires breaking tradition to follow God's expansion of grace. However, the exegesis is somewhat broad and thematic rather than detailed.

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of a 'Visionary' homiletic that prioritizes the transformation of the hearer's imagination over the provision of practical tips. It falls short in providing concrete, actionable steps (Active Experimentation), leaving the 'five-year plan' as a conceptual rather than a practical tool. The sermon effectively uses the tension between Psalm 122 and Acts 15 to create a space for reflective observation, successfully challenging the hearer's desire for 'certitude' and 'control'. While the 'cranky critic' anecdote provides a moment of concrete experience, the sermon quickly moves into a more abstract, theological register. It is intellectually stimulating and poetically evocative, but it risks leaving the 'accommodating' and 'converging' learners without a clear path forward. The primary strength lies in its ability to reframe the biblical tradition as an 'adventure' rather than a 'citadel'.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a sophisticated theological reflection that excels in the 'Visionary' and 'Reflective' phases of Kolb's cycle. It successfully deconstructs a static view of tradition and invites the hearer into a more dynamic, 'apostolic' way of being. However, from a learning theory perspective, it is incomplete. The movement toward 'Active Experimentation' is more of a poetic gesture than a practical guide. For a congregation to truly embark on the 'adventure' described, they require more concrete handles and specific ethical directions. The sermon is highly effective for those who learn through imagination and reflection (Diverging/Assimilating), but it may leave those who learn through doing and problem-solving (Accommodating/Converging) inspired but unequipped. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'haunting vision' and the 'incremental step'."
