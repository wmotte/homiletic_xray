It operates primarily from an Adult-Adult transaction, acknowledging the harsh realities of the church's situation (Adult) while providing Nurturing Parent support. It avoids the Drama Triangle by refusing to 'Rescue' the church from its fragility, instead reframing that fragility as the necessary container for the 'treasure.' The preacher validates the 'Child's' grief and anxiety without allowing those emotions to dictate the church's identity.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize that the 'extraordinary power' is available to all 'clay pots,' not just the ordained leadership, to prevent a Rescuer/Victim dynamic from forming around the new leadership gap."
