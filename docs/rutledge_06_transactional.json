  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' common in apocalyptic preaching. Instead of using fear (CP) to drive compliance (AC), the preacher uses the Adult ego state to analyze the 'alien' nature of the text and the NP to provide a container for the resulting anxiety. By acknowledging the 'absurdity' of the gospel, the preacher respects the listener's Adult ego, creating a high-trust environment. The focus on 'apocalyptic ethics' moves the listener from passivity to agency.",
    "strengths": [
      "High Adult presence validates the listener's intellect.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The anecdote about the cross-body strap is slightly 'Parental' in its protective nature.",
      "Could further engage the Free Child's creativity regarding what the 'new world' looks like."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements when discussing faith and doubt. The phrase 'The preacher tonight is not asking you to believe it' is a powerful game-breaker—keep using such disclaimers to maintain Adult-Adult rapport."
