  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of traditional Nurturing Parent preaching. It provides significant emotional comfort and utilizes the Free Child's capacity for wonder. However, it suffers from Critical Parent intrusions where the preacher uses the pulpit to settle scores with social movements and intellectual critics. This creates a 'we-are-safe-and-right' versus 'they-are-failed-and-wrong' dynamic that can stunt the Adult ego development of the listener.",
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of sensory language to engage the Free Child.",
      "Strong Nurturing Parent presence that provides genuine comfort for grief."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "High level of judgment toward those outside the 'church' circle.",
      "Tendency to romanticize dependency (the 'poor woman' trope)."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the 'Black Power' or 'Science' critiques from an Adult position (processing their data/concerns) rather than a Critical Parent position (labeling them 'not well-adjusted'). This invites the congregation to think rather than just comply."
