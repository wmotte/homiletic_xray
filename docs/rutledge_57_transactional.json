It avoids 'NIGYSOB' by showing compassion for Elijah's depression rather than just condemning his failure. It avoids 'Ain't It Awful' by moving from the critique of the world (Ann Coulter) back to the internal spiritual state of the listener."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and remarkably free of TA 'games.' It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, utilizing psychological insights to humanize the biblical text. By deconstructing the desire for 'pyrotechnics' and 'power,' the preacher discourages the congregation from entering into Adapted Child (submission to power) or Persecutor (vengeance) roles. The use of personal narrative in the introduction establishes a safe, Nurturing Parent atmosphere that transitions smoothly into Adult reflection.",
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of psychological framing (anger/depression/grandiosity).",
      "Avoidance of coercive 'should/must' language.",
      "High transparency and communicative purity."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the Ann Coulter critique back to the Gospel could be seen as a brief 'Persecutor' flash, though it serves the Adult argument.",
      "The introduction is long; ensure the Free Child nostalgia doesn't overshadow the Adult message."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' position to analyze biblical characters' motivations, as it empowers the congregation to do the same with their own lives."
