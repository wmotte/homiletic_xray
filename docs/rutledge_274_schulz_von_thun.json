    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates a strong grasp of the Johannine 'Sache'. He correctly identifies the wedding at Cana as a 'sign' (semeion) rather than a mere magic trick, linking it to the messianic banquet of the Hebrew Bible. The exegetical work on the purification jars is particularly sharp; he moves beyond the surface level of the miracle to the dogmatic reality that the 'old water' of religious ritual cannot cleanse the conscience. He avoids dry intellectualism by weaving the factual content into the existential crisis of 'running out of wine'. However, the transition from the secular anecdotes to the biblical exegesis is somewhat abrupt, relying on a thematic bridge of 'regret' rather than a direct exegetical necessity. The theological depth is found in the abundance (2100 glasses), emphasizing the 'extraordinariness' of grace.",
      "quotes": [
        "The water in the story represents all our human attempts, and especially our religious attempts, to make things right.",
        "The wedding feast, throughout the Hebrew Bible, was the primary image of salvation.",

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The preacher uses concrete numbers (2100 glasses) to make abstract theological concepts of 'abundance' tangible."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as a cultured, observant, and somewhat melancholic intellectual. He uses personal anecdotes (the memorial service, reading personal ads) to establish common ground. There is a conscious 'Selbstdarstellung' of a seasoned minister who is aware of his own mortality and the limitations of his craft. He explicitly mentions his prayer life and his sense of responsibility as a guest preacher, which serves to build trust. However, there is a slight 'leaking' of weariness—the mention of 'going to funerals' and 'time wasted' suggests a preacher who is wrestling with the same 'creeping chill' he describes in the congregation. The 'I' is largely diaconal, used to mirror the listener's experience before pointing to Christ.",
      "quotes": [
        "I found my attention drifting. I began wondering what trivial anecdotes people would tell about me.",
        "For the first time in my twenty-two years of ministry I find myself nowadays preaching... to congregations I do not know.",

      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive-Compulsive. The preacher seeks harmony and closeness through shared vulnerability (Depressive), yet maintains a very structured, orderly homiletical movement and a concern for 'taking responsibility seriously' (Compulsive).",

    },
    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined by 'solidarity in lack'. The preacher speaks 'at eye level', placing himself among those who feel regret and disappointment. He uses 'we' and 'us' frequently, avoiding a paternalistic 'from above' stance. However, there is a subtle 'teaching' authority when he corrects the misunderstanding of Jesus' 'rudeness' to Mary. The mention of 'Episcopal weddings' and 'The New York Review of Books' defines the relationship as one between educated, upper-middle-class individuals. While this creates immediate rapport with the specific congregation in Washington, CT, it creates a 'class-based' relationship noise that might exclude those outside that demographic.",

        "I do not believe there is any one within earshot today... who does not recognize the creeping chill.",
        "If you are too young to know this feeling, don’t worry, you’ll get there sooner or later.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. The preacher masterfully balances Law and Gospel. The 'Law' is not a list of moral demands, but the existential 'Law' of human limitation—the wine running out. The 'Appeal' (Red Side) is not a demand for better behavior, but a call to 'Faith/Rest/Trust' (Zuspruch). He explicitly rejects the 'moralism' of self-help books and religious rituals. The appeal is for the hearer to recognize their thirst and look to Christ. The ratio of Promise (Zuspruch) to Demand (Anspruch) is heavily weighted toward Promise, which is homiletically sound for an Epiphany text. The final appeal is to 'remember' and 'believe', which flows directly from the 'Gift' of the 2100 glasses of wine.",
      "quotes": [
        "Whatever he tells you, do it.",
        "The message of Epiphany is that the Son of God is powerful to save.",
        "There is the promise of God through faith in Jesus Christ, and that is everything."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The sermon is 80% Zuspruch (Promise). The only 'Anspruch' is the call to trust and the mention of a 'life of service' as a result of grace.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Very low. The preacher explicitly critiques moralistic 'escapes' and 'religious rituals'.",
      "strengths": [

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'life of service' mentioned at the end is a bit underdeveloped; it appears as a sudden moral category.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a sophisticated and theologically robust sermon that avoids the common pitfalls of moralism. By using the Schulz von Thun framework, we see a preacher who uses the 'Green' side (Self-revelation) to create a 'Yellow' (Relational) bridge of shared human lack, which then allows the 'Blue' (Factual) exegesis of the Cana sign to land as a powerful 'Red' (Appeal) of pure Gospel promise. The preacher successfully navigates the Barthian concern by making Christ the 'Acting Subject'—it is Jesus who provides the wine, not the human effort of 'searching for dreams'. The sermon is particularly strong in its 'Zuspruch', offering the abundance of Christ as the only answer to the 'creeping chill' of human regret. While the cultural references are somewhat narrow, they are used effectively to diagnose the 'thirst' of the specific congregation. The transition from the 'secular' to the 'sacred' is handled with professional poise, though it leans heavily on the preacher's intellectual persona.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a slight risk of 'psychologizing' the miracle by framing it primarily as an answer to 'regret', but the preacher saves this by grounding the solution in the objective 'Cross and Resurrection' rather than just a subjective 'feeling' of peace.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Masterful use of the 'abundance' motif (2100 glasses) to illustrate grace.",
      "Sharp critique of 'religious ritual' as ineffective water.",
      "Strong homiletical movement from existential lack to Christological fulfillment."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Broaden cultural references to be more inclusive beyond the 'literary' class.",
      "Tighten the connection between the 'personal ad' and the 'purification jars'.",
      "Develop the 'life of service' more clearly as a fruit of the wine."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, congruent sermon that serves the 'Sache' of the Gospel with psychological intelligence and theological integrity."
