    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon employs effective imagery by juxtaposing the biblical narrative with contemporary tragedy. Rutledge moves beyond abstract 'preparedness' to sensory descriptions of 'guttering lamps' and the 'stench' of violence, though the latter is implied through the context of the Charleston shooting. The strength lies in the 'cinematic' transition from the bridesmaids leaping to their feet to the members of Mother Emanuel standing in a courtyard. She successfully 'shows' the oil as a 'stored-up emergency supply' rather than just defining it. However, some metaphors remain traditional (bridegroom, wedding feast) without radical new linguistic framing, relying instead on the weight of the historical event to provide the 'image' power.",
      "quotes": [
        "The bridesmaids leap to their feet, grab their guttering lamps, trim them, and pour in their reserves of oil.",
        "Rising up with all its lamps burning, and with plenty of extra oil for the long, long haul ahead.",
        "They were standing out in the courtyard of their horribly violated church, and they were singing 'Let My Little Light Shine.'"

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Rutledge exhibits high stewardship of language, consistent with McEntyre’s criteria. She avoids 'Canaanite' jargon, instead using precise theological terms like 'dialectic,' 'eschatological,' and 'apocalyptic' while grounding them in human experience. Her word choice is economical and deliberate; she distinguishes between 'premature forgiveness' and 'mature faith' with surgical precision. The language is 'loving' in the sense that it does justice to the victims of the shooting without falling into sentimental platitudes. She carefully navigates the 'passage between justice and mercy,' showing a high degree of linguistic care and intellectual honesty.",
      "quotes": [
        "This sort of premature, even invasive, call for forgiveness should never be inflicted on anyone.",
        "The eschatological, even apocalyptic, atmosphere of the New Testament has finally begun to percolate down.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a strong rhetorical cadence, particularly in its use of repetition and parallelism. The 'waiting and hastening' motif creates a rhythmic pulse that mirrors the theme of Advent. Rutledge uses staccato sentences to create tension ('Darkness has fallen. More hours go by.') and longer, more lyrical passages for theological reflection. The ending is particularly musical, culminating in the rhythmic repetition of 'With him!' which functions as a liturgical refrain. It is clearly a text written for the ear, avoiding the 'paper language' of a dry lecture, though some of the middle sections regarding commentaries feel slightly more academic and less rhythmic.",
      "quotes": [
        "Advent is the time of both 'waiting and hastening'.",

    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober-Reformed' beauty. It avoids the fluff of contemporary 'kitsch' while maintaining a high level of precision and imagery. Rutledge uses the 'oil' and 'lamps' not as tired symbols, but as urgent realities. The musicality is most evident in the eschatological sections where the rhythm of 'waiting and hastening' drives the narrative. It is a text that respects the weight of words, treating them as 'stewards' of a reality that is both 'already' and 'not yet'."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a masterful 'homiletical plot' as described by Lowry. It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium'—declaring an Advent sermon in June. The tension is then heightened by the 'problem' of the delayed bridegroom and the 'darkness' of the Charleston shooting. The turning point is not a cheap solution, but the 'reframing' of the oil as the 'witness of the Spirit' found in the suffering church. The energy does not drop; it builds from the 'tedium of waiting' to the 'electrifying cry' of the Gospel. The conclusion provides a resolution that is both a 'happy ending' (the feast) and a 'sustained tension' (the 'not yet' of I John 3:2).",
      "quotes": [
        "This will be an Advent sermon... in the middle of the so-called 'long green season'.",
        "Suddenly the electrifying cry arises, 'He’s coming!'",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 9,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. Rutledge achieves a profound 'reframing' (Cilliers). She takes a well-known, often moralized parable and reframes it through the lens of racial trauma and the 'maturity' of the black church. The synthesis is not forced; the 'oil' becomes the 'DNA' of a community that has lived in the 'middle of the night' for generations. She respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the late bridegroom, the shut door) and uses the contemporary context to illuminate it, rather than using the text as a mere springboard. The result is a 'new optics' for seeing both the Bible and the news.",
      "quotes": [
        "They don’t need to run out to the store in the middle of the night... They’ve been in the middle of the night for a long time.",
        "What we have seen... is neither the triumph of the human spirit nor the goodness of the American people. It was a cloud of witnesses.",
        "The black churches have suffered so extremely... they have achieved a maturity that sometimes seems almost superhuman."

      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of the oil as the 'stored-up' resilience of a persecuted community.",
        "Honors the 'strangeness' of the parable while making it urgently relevant.",
        "Avoids the 'kitsch' of 'the goodness of the American people' by pointing to 'divine agency'."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Could perhaps engage more with the 'shut door' aspect of the text in relation to the shooter, though this is handled delicately.",
        "The 'bridesmaids vs. virgins' commentary is a bit of a 'context' distraction from the deeper 'reframing'.",
        "Could further explore the 'bridegroom's delay' in relation to the long history of racial injustice."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "A powerful new frame: the 'wise virgins' are not the 'good' people, but the 'prepared' people who have suffered and stayed awake."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon functions as an 'open work of art' (Stark) by refusing to offer easy answers to the 'why' of the tragedy. It acknowledges the 'mystification' of the world and leaves the 'ultimate destiny of the foolish five' open for debate. However, it is 'closed' in its strong Christological focus—which, in a Reformed context, is a strength of 'Space for Grace' rather than a limitation. It invites the hearer into the 'procession' without forcing a moralistic 'to-do' list. The ending with I John 3:2 leaves the hearer in the 'mystery' of what we shall be, rather than a neatly tied-up package.",
      "quotes": [
        "We can be here for the rest of the day debating the ultimate destiny of the foolish five.",

        "Leaves room for the 'mystification' of the secular world without judging it harshly."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'Barthian' solutions occasionally feel a bit 'theologically sealed' for a listener not familiar with that tradition.",
        "Could leave more 'open space' for the listener to contemplate their own 'oil' levels.",
        "The 'With him!' climax is very powerful but also very 'definitive'—could allow for a moment of silence."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Polyvalent: it speaks to the liturgical season, the national tragedy, and the individual soul simultaneously."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 8.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are exceptionally strong. The sermon is a dynamic journey that successfully 'reframes' a difficult parable through a traumatic contemporary event. It avoids the static 'three-point' structure in favor of a narrative arc that moves from the 'tedium' of ordinary time to the 'triumph' of the parousia. The integration of text and context is seamless, creating a 'Space for Grace' that is both intellectually rigorous and emotionally resonant. It is a model of how to preach 'in the middle of the night'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a powerful antidote to religious kitsch. Rutledge explicitly identifies and rejects kitsch in the form of 'premature forgiveness' and the 'triumph of the human spirit.' She refuses to 'beautify' the Charleston shooting or offer a 'happy ending' that ignores the 'horribly violated church.' By maintaining the 'dialectic' of Advent, she avoids the sentimentality that often plagues sermons on tragedy. The emotion is authentic because it is rooted in 'maturity' and 'suffering' rather than 'pre-chewed' feelings. This is 'sober beauty' at its finest.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'premature, even invasive, call for forgiveness' at Columbine.",

      "The focus on the 'guttering lamps' and the 'long, long haul ahead'."

    "recommendation": "Continue to name and deconstruct 'secular kitsch' (like 'human spirit' talk) to highlight the 'strangeness' of the Gospel."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened by the refusal to moralize the parable. Rutledge follows Cilliers' lead by showing that the 'oil' is not a human achievement but a 'witness of the Spirit.' She sustains the tension between 'waiting and hastening' and between 'justice and mercy.' The 'Space for Grace' is found in the 'between'—between the first and second coming. By pointing to 'divine agency' rather than human effort, she relieves the hearer of the 'burden' of the gospel and presents it as a 'gift' of presence ('With him!').",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension of the 'not yet' is maintained until the final verse of I John.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of God's timing and the 'ultimate destiny' of the lost is respected.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the 'wise' are those who receive the oil, not those who 'work' for it.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure that the 'divine agency' doesn't become a 'deus ex machina' that shuts down the human 'hastening' too quickly."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 8.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically superior example of 'Reframing' and 'Stewardship of Language.' Rutledge demonstrates a profound ability to synthesize a difficult biblical text with a crushing historical moment without falling into kitsch or moralism. The aesthetic power lies in the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed tradition—where the form (the Advent dialectic) perfectly matches the content (the resilience of the suffering church). The language is precise, the imagery is grounded in reality, and the 'Space for Grace' is wide enough to hold both the lament of Charleston and the hope of the Kingdom. It is a 'performance' of faith that respects the 'holy happening' in the midst of darkness.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Profound 'Reframing' of the oil as the DNA of a suffering, mature church.",
      "Rejection of 'Religious Kitsch' and sentimental 'human spirit' narratives.",
      "Strong 'Dramaturgy' that moves from the 'long green season' to the eschatological 'feast'."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The academic 'detour' into biblical commentaries could be more aesthetically integrated.",
      "The 'bridesmaids/virgins' humor, while humanizing, slightly jars with the high aesthetic seriousness of the rest of the text.",

    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Kitsch), Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Four Pages), and Karl Barth (Dialectic).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'mature' hearers who are weary of 'cheap comfort' and seek a faith with 'guts' and intellectual depth.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'sensory' descriptions of the 'new heavens and new earth' to heighten the 'hastening' aspect.",
      "Read the 'commentary' sections aloud to ensure they don't slip into 'paper language'.",
      "Maintain the 'anti-kitsch' stance, as it is the preacher's strongest aesthetic asset."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A model of homiletic aesthetics that proves 'how' something is said is inseparable from 'what' is said. Rutledge does not 'beautify' the Gospel; she allows the Gospel's own 'strange beauty' to shine through the cracks of a broken world. The sermon is a 'Space for Grace' that honors the victims of Emanuel AME by placing their witness within the 'lighted procession' of Christ. It is an 8.2/10—an exceptional aesthetic achievement that avoids the pitfalls of modern sentimentality."
