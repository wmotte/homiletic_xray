    "sermon_start_end": "We extend a very special welcome today to those who do not often come to church. This sermon is written with you in mind. It’s always fascinating to try to figure out what Easter means to people who aren’t usually here. As a matter of fact, it’s revealing [...] I know it because my grandmother told me fifty-five years ago, and because one year ago on Easter Sunday a preacher whom I trusted told me again. I trust the witnesses. That’s what we all are, in the last analysis — witnesses. Alleluia! The Lord is risen indeed!"

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon focuses sharply on the 'strange ending' of Mark's Gospel. It identifies the unique character of this specific pericope—the fear and silence of the women—as something distinct from the other Gospels. It avoids general 'Easter' truths by dwelling on the specific terror mentioned in verse 8.",
      "quotes": [
        "Most scholars now believe that Mark intended to end this way... this last verse makes a powerful impression. Matthew and Luke have toned it down considerably."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'nowhere else' aspect by exploring why Mark specifically chose 'fear' as the final note, rather than just contrasting it with greeting cards."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates awareness of the textual history (the added endings) and the literary intent of the author. However, there is no explicit use of Greek or deep historical-critical exploration of the 'Galilee' promise or the specific nature of 'trembling and astonishment' (tromos kai ekstasis).",
      "quotes": [
        "Two alternative endings were written and were stuck on to the Gospel of Mark; we can read them in most Bibles."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the specific Greek nuances of 'ekstasis' to show that this fear is a specific theological reaction to the divine, not just psychological panic."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is sharp and polemical against the 'zeitgeist' of sentimentalism (bunnies, butterflies). It uses a very concrete, tragic example (the hit-and-run in Detroit) to test the validity of the sermon's claims.",
      "quotes": [
        "I was in a gift shop in an Episcopal church recently... not one card with any reference to the Resurrection.",
        "While I was in Grosse Pointe, the wife of a leading Detroit banker was struck by a hit-and-run driver..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the critique of greeting cards into a more concrete application of how the 'fear' of Mark 16:8 manifests in modern secular or religious life."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon alternates between the text and the contemporary critique of 'generic Easter.' However, the first half is heavily weighted toward cultural observation before returning to the text in the middle.",
      "quotes": [
        "The impression given by Mark is one of real terror... What a contrast to the photographs on the greeting cards!"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'exposition' of the women's flight is the engine of the application from the start, rather than using the text as a mid-point correction for cultural observations."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon deals heavily with 'misery' (death, the hit-and-run, the silence of the women) and 'redemption' (the act of God). 'Gratitude' (the life of the believer following the news) is less developed, as the sermon ends on the note of 'witnessing' and 'trust.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The furrows of the grave — that is all the women could see.",
        "Resurrection means that something utterly new and unlooked for has been done by God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Develop the 'gratitude' or 'sanctification' aspect: what does it look like to live as a witness who has moved from 'fear' to 'indescribable joy'?"
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are present in the distinction between 'generic life after death' (destruction/falsehood) and 'resurrection' (life). However, the urgency of human choice and the possibility of being 'lost' is softened into a matter of 'trust' rather than a life-and-death decision.",
      "quotes": [
        "Belief in life after death is so commonplace as to be meaningless.",
        "Those traditions will disappear... because they take neither man nor God seriously. [Implicit in the critique of liberal clergy]"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly address the consequence of remaining in the 'generic' spring-festival faith versus the 'narrow way' of the Resurrection."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "Strongly Christocentric. The sermon insists on the two natures (God acting in history) and Christ as the sole source of life outside of nature. It rejects any human-centered 'renewal.'",
      "quotes": [
        "He is not in nature... He is risen.",
        "Christ has entered death and descended into hell for our sakes and has wrested supremacy away from them forever."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The ending leans slightly on 'subjective trust' (grandmother, preacher) rather than the objective 'Extra Nos' of Christ which the rest of the sermon defended."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 1850 words, the sermon likely falls just under the 20-minute threshold (18.5 minutes) required by Dekker for 'breadth.' It lacks the 'broad knowledge of humanities' (sociology, philosophy) Dekker expects, focusing mostly on cultural critique of the church.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the theological depth regarding the 'resurrection of the body' versus 'immortality' to reach the 20-minute mark."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong polemic that rightly identifies the 'scandal' of the specific Markan text. It falls short of Dekker's length requirement and lacks the rigorous academic exposition (Hebrew/Greek) demanded by his theses. While it avoids 'general truths' by attacking sentimentalism, it relies heavily on cultural anecdotes rather than a deep 'expositional' dive into the biblical text's unique contribution.",
    "strengths": [
      "Specific focus on the unique ending of Mark 16:8.",
      "Sharp distinction between 'natural renewal' and 'supernatural resurrection'.",
      "Concrete application through the Detroit hit-and-run example."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (under 20 minutes).",
      "Lack of explicit linguistic/historical exegesis.",
      "The 'two ways' (the seriousness of being lost) is underdeveloped."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'strong' attempt at a sermon according to Dekker's formal definition, particularly in its refusal of generalities. However, it lacks the 'breadth' and 'academic rigor' required to be a full realization of his homiletic ideal."
