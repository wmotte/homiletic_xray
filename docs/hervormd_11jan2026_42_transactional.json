    "psychological_health_score": 2,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically heavy and utilizes coercive Parent-Child dynamics. It relies on the 'Bait and Switch' of grace and law, where grace is only accessible after a total ego-collapse (the 'knife'). By framing the preacher's personal conviction as a direct mandate from a 'Master,' it bypasses the listener's Adult ego, making healthy, autonomous faith difficult. The use of fear as a primary motivator ('great danger,' 'lost forever') is a hallmark of manipulative communication.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong internal consistency within its theological framework.",
      "Clear, vivid imagery (the desert, the reins, the GPS)."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on Critical Parent judgments.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult engagement; the listener is never invited to think, only to submit.",
      "The definition of 'love' is inextricably linked to psychological violence ('the knife')."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try using 'I-statements' regarding your own struggle with repentance rather than 'You-statements' that judge the congregation. Invite the congregation to observe the biblical text as Adult researchers rather than as children being scolded. Reduce the use of 'must' and 'danger' to allow the Free Child to respond to God out of attraction rather than fear."
