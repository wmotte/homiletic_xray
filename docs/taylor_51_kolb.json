These men who had followed Jesus, betting on him everything they had and were, now began to see some hazards and horrors for which, quite frankly, they had not bargained. [...] So the Shepherd will search and find his sheep \"and when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.\"",

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a strong 'hook' using the horse-racing metaphor and the psychological state of the disciples. It successfully evokes the feeling of 'triumphalism' and the subsequent 'bewilderment' of the followers. The preacher connects the biblical narrative to the recognizable human experience of feeling 'trapped' and 'unsatisfied'. However, the identification remains somewhat generalized ('we feel a disquiet') rather than utilizing specific, contemporary character-driven narratives.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher moves into a cultural critique, observing the 'altar of greed' and the 'collapse of the civic contract.' He pauses to ask why the society is obsessed with acquisition. While the analysis of greed is clear, it lacks a deeper psychological or sociological exploration of *why* this shift has occurred beyond a surface-level critique of TV evangelists. The reflection on the human condition is present but moves quickly toward theological answers.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a solid theological framework by interpreting Jesus as 'the way out, through, and in.' It connects the text to the nature of God (the 'unbelievable patience') and the concept of 'dual citizenship.' The exegesis of John 14 is faithful, though it relies heavily on traditional dogmatic language rather than fresh theological insights. The 'big idea'—that Christ is the answer to the human sense of foiled destiny—is clearly formulated.",

The call to 'walk with a firmer tread' or 'be of good cheer' remains at the level of internal disposition rather than external ethical action.

    "summary": "The sermon is a rhetorically strong example of visionary-declarative preaching that effectively engages the hearer's imagination and theological understanding. It falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase, providing few concrete handles for the congregation to implement the truths discussed. The movement through the first three phases of Kolb's cycle is traceable and effective: it begins with the concrete experience of the disciples' bewilderment, moves to a reflective observation of modern greed and the human sense of being 'trapped', and culminates in a theological conceptualization of Jesus as the 'Way'. However, the transition from 'knowing' and 'feeling' to 'doing' is neglected. The language is evocative and the structure is clear, but the application remains largely internal and dispositional.",

    "conclusion": "The sermon is a well-crafted piece of homiletical art that succeeds in making the biblical world and the eternal future vivid to the hearer. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon—strong on experience, reflection, and conceptualization, but tapering off before reaching concrete application. It effectively addresses the 'why' and 'what', but leaves the 'how' to the hearer's imagination. To move from a 6 to an 8, the preacher must bridge the gap between the 'sunlit shores' of the future and the 'dusty roads' of the present through specific ethical and practical guidance."
