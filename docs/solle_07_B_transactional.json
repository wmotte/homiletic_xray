        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher largely avoids moralistic 'musts.' Instead of imposing law, the text critiques the 'Critical Parent' of church tradition (sexism, hierarchy). There is a slight CP tone when dismissing traditional theology as 'embarrassing' or 'catastrophic.'",

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The sermon avoids games like 'ITHY' or 'NIGYSOB' because it does not position the preacher as a superior rescuer or a judge. By admitting the 'overwhelming' nature of the text and grounding the solution in common human experience (Eros) rather than religious performance, the 'Con' is removed."

    "preacher_roles": {

    "congregation_position": "The congregation is invited into the role of 'Autonomous Subject' rather than Victim.",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It operates primarily from an Adult-Adult stance, validating the Free Child's capacity for love and joy. By deconstructing the Critical Parent of 'sexist tradition,' it removes the typical 'guilt-payoff' found in many sermons. It empowers the listener to use their own positive life experiences as a hermeneutic for understanding the divine, promoting autonomy rather than dependency.",

      "The critique of tradition (CP) could be perceived as slightly aggressive.",
      "The 'successful erotic relationship' model might alienate those currently in pain or loneliness."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to ground theological concepts in 'here-and-now' Adult observations. To ensure total inclusivity, acknowledge that 'the Great All' is also available to those who are currently in a state of 'lack' or 'brokenness,' not just those in 'successful relationships.'"
