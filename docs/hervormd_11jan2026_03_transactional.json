    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of Parent-Child homiletics. While it offers comfort (NP), it does so by first inducing a state of 'uncleanliness' and 'rebellion' (CP) in the listener. The use of the Drama Triangle is evident: the listener is the Victim (the sick woman), Sin/Law is the Persecutor, and the Preacher/Jesus is the Rescuer. This maintains a cycle of dependency rather than promoting Adult autonomy.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as 'Adults' who are capable of making a choice based on the beauty of the Gospel, rather than 'Children' who must be coerced by the threat of 'uncleanliness' or 'rebellion.' Reduce the use of 'must' and 'command' (CP) and increase the 'Free Child's' authentic joy without the immediate weight of the Cross as a guilt-inducer."
