    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Rescue' theology. While it aims for a payoff of 'joy' and 'safety,' it achieves this by first psychologically lowering the listener into a 'black, dank, filthy hole' of total depravity. This creates a Parent-Child dependency where the listener's psychological health is contingent upon feeling 'terror' and 'wrath' before being allowed 'mercy'. The use of public shaming (CP) against those who don't repent serves to reinforce the preacher's position of moral superiority.",

      "Heavy reliance on shaming and 'terror' to motivate the listener.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult address that respects the listener's current reality without pathologizing it."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation's capacity for Adult choice and responsibility without first requiring them to adopt a 'Victim' (pit-dweller) identity. Reduce the use of Critical Parent 'staggering' at others' ignorance."
