    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and remarkably game-free. It avoids the common 'NIGYSOB' trap of religious discourse by ensuring the preacher is the first target of any critical observation. By using an Adult-to-Adult transaction, the preacher respects the listener's autonomy and invites them into a shared reality of vulnerability and hope. The use of the Nurturing Parent ego state provides safety without creating dependency, as the 'cure' (grace) is external to the preacher's own authority.",

      "The transition between the 'law' (Matthew's holiness) and 'grace' (Paul's justification) could be even more Adult-processed to avoid confusing the 'Adapted Child' listeners.",
      "Slight risk of 'Ain't It Awful' when discussing the homeless, though mitigated by the call to action."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements when discussing sin and judgment. This prevents the Critical Parent from taking over the pulpit and keeps the transaction Adult-to-Adult."
