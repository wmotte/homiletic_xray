    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in hortatory preaching. By operating primarily from the Adult ego state, the preacher respects the listener's agency. The deconstruction of 'Woe' from a Persecutor's threat to a Nurturing Parent's concern ('Alas') prevents the listener from falling into a fearful Adapted Child state. The use of the 'Coach' analogy successfully frames authority as a catalyst for personal growth rather than a tool for suppression.",

      "The 'Free Child' element is somewhat intellectualized; more visceral, authentic emotion could balance the heavy 'Adult' data-processing.",
      "The 'Middle Class in Spirit' critique could briefly flirt with 'Critical Parent' if not careful."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'diagnostic' language rather than 'imperative' language. By explaining 'why' things happen (the house on sand) rather than just 'what' will happen (destruction), you maintain an Adult-to-Adult connection."
