It was a predatory economy of getting everything one could for one’s self at the expense of every other person. Does that sound familiar? It is not a new [...] But, says the Psalmist, those who ask rightly, prosper. What better! What better than to prosper through right asking. That is the good news, very good news indeed!"

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon lacks a single, specific pericope as its foundation. While it starts with James 4, it quickly becomes a thematic synthesis of James, Matthew, Galatians, Psalm 148, and Psalm 1. It fails Dekker's requirement to find what is in 'THIS text that you can find NOWHERE else'. Instead, it treats the Bible as a collection of supporting ideas for a general theme of 'right asking'.",
      "quotes": [
        "If we read back behind James and back behind the summons of Jesus, we come quickly to the Torah of Israel.",
        "So I wondered. What would James say is 'right asking'?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one pericope (e.g., James 4:1-10) and exhaust its specific logic rather than jumping to other biblical books to fill in the gaps."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is a sociological sketch of the Roman Empire and the 'economy of bragging rights.' However, this remains at a general historical level rather than a linguistic or deep exegetical level. The preacher assumes the meaning of 'cravings' and 'wrong asking' without exploring the specific Greek nuances or the particular crisis of the community James addressed.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Roman Empire was an economy of bragging rights that required aggressive, ambitious behavior...",
        "James identifies two violations of the Big Ten from Sinai..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Engage with the specific theological weight of the Greek text and the unique rhetorical structure of the passage in James."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part of the sermon. It is concrete regarding the US economy, the loan/credit system, and specific child poverty statistics in Cincinnati. It avoids vague 'be kind' language in favor of structural critique.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is an exposé of the entire loan and credit system that preys upon the vulnerable...",
        "in my town, Cincinnati, 53 percent of the children live below the poverty line."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application flows strictly from the specific text rather than a general socio-political critique that could be applied to many texts."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured in blocks (I, II, III, IV, V). While the application is woven into the sections, it feels more like a lecture or a social analysis followed by biblical proof-texting rather than the hearer being 'expounded' by the text itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "The social analysis goes in three stages...",
        "What would James say is 'right asking'... Maybe this:"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the numbered list structure (1, 2, 3, 4) which creates a didactic lecture feel; allow the text's movement to dictate the sermon's flow."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'misery' (the predatory economy and wrong asking) is well-defined. 'Redemption' is present but leans heavily toward human action (right asking) rather than the objective work of Christ. 'Gratitude' is framed as 'prospering' and 'fruit of the spirit.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Those who do not ask rightly perish, as is happening right before our eyes.",
        "The outcome of right asking is what Paul terms 'the fruit of the spirit'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'redemption' aspect by emphasizing God's grace as the source of change, rather than just an 'alternative proposal' for human behavior."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon explicitly addresses the 'two ways' (perishing vs. prospering). It takes the threat of being 'lost in time' (societal collapse) very seriously, which aligns with Dekker's liberal tradition analysis.",
      "quotes": [
        "Those who do not ask rightly perish, as is happening right before our eyes.",
        "The Psalm concerns an alternative life... It is a way that does not walk in the way of sinners."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'eternal' dimension of being lost to complement the 'temporal' loss, making the choice even more ultimate."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as a teacher of an 'alternative' and as the one who holds up children, but He is not the 'telos' or the 'God' of the sermon. The sermon is more 'Torah-centric' or 'wisdom-centric' than Christocentric in the Barthian/Dekkerian sense.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have been taught an alternative by Jesus...",
        "Jesus holds up the little ones as a test case."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Present Christ not just as an example or teacher of right asking, but as the one in whom the 'right asking' is already fulfilled for us."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1150 words, the sermon would likely take 11-12 minutes. This is significantly below Dekker's 20-minute minimum. The 'depth' is sacrificed for a broad thematic survey of multiple Bible passages.",
      "quotes": [
        "n/a"

      "improvement_point": "Increase the length by slowing down to dwell on the specificities of one text; 'depth needs breadth'."

  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon functions more as a thematic social-ethical lecture than a proclamatory word rooted in a specific pericope. It fails the formal definition of a sermon by jumping between James, Matthew, and the Psalms, preventing the 'specific word' of a single text from emerging. It is too short to achieve the necessary homiletical depth and relies on Jesus as an ethical teacher rather than the ontological telos of the text.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete contemporary application regarding economic systems and poverty statistics.",
      "Clear articulation of the 'two ways' and the seriousness of societal destruction.",
      "Effective use of the 'misery' category through the analysis of the 'predatory economy'."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of a single, specific Bible passage; it is a thematic synthesis.",
      "Insufficient duration (approx. 12 minutes) to allow for 'depth'.",
      "Christ is treated as an ethical example rather than the source of grace and the goal of the sermon."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is an insightful ethical speech about 'right asking' and 'social justice,' but it lacks the formal rigor of exposition/application of a specific pericope and falls short of the required length for substantive proclamation."
