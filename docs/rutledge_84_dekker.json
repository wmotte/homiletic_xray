  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses two major pericopes rather than one specific passage. This dilutes the specificity Dekker demands. While it identifies the 'unconditional' nature of Ezekiel 37, it tends toward general themes of resurrection rather than what can be found 'nowhere else'.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is rather unexpected to find two of the greatest of all Resurrection texts here in the middle of Lent."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus exclusively on either Ezekiel or John to extract the unique theological 'point' that is absent from the rest of Scripture."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Adequate attention to the historical context of the Babylonian exile and the Jewish belief in the general resurrection. However, it relies more on literary effect than deep exegetical labor in the original languages.",
      "quotes": [
        "The first part of the prophet’s book is an extended indictment of God’s people... The people are dragged off as captives to an unthinkable place: mighty Babylon."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the linguistic and theological particularity of the Hebrew/Greek concepts (e.g., 'Ruach' or 'Hos oun') beyond narrative summary."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Strong use of contemporary cultural references (Philip Larkin) and historical biography (Von Moltke). It avoids vague 'be kind' moralism, though it leans heavily on the 'zeitgeist' of death-anxiety.",
      "quotes": [
        "Is this worship today in this cathedral a 'vast, moth-eaten musical brocade,' and are we here to pretend?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the application more directly to the specific congregational life of the hearers rather than relying on historical figures like Von Moltke."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a block structure: Poetry/Intro, then Ezekiel, then John, then Von Moltke. This separation prevents the 'present of revelation' where the hearer is 'expounded' alongside the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let’s hold that question in our minds for a few minutes as we look at our two readings.",
        "But we must hasten on to the New Testament lesson..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Integrate the application (the 'now') into the movement of the text's exposition rather than treating them as separate chapters."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The theme of misery (death, exile, Nazi oppression) is starkly present. Redemption is clearly outside of man (God's unconditional action). Gratitude is exemplified in Von Moltke’s letter.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Israelites have done less than nothing to restore God’s faith in them... He raises them from the dust because he is their God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'misery' is not just physical death but the 'misery before God' (sin/apostasy) as mentioned in the Ezekiel context."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are present in the contrast between 'pretending' and 'believing'. The seriousness of the choice is emphasized by the closing question, though the threat of being 'lost' is softened.",
      "quotes": [
        "Do you believe this?",
        "The refusal to put out [Nazi] flags... it has all at last become comprehensible in a single hour."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Thematically address the possibility of being 'lost in time' (failing God's call) more sharply for the modern hearer."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "Strongly Christocentric. Christ is the telos and the one who 'reconstitutes' life. The doctrine of the two natures is implicit in the 'Incarnate Word' and the 'Son of God' who raises the dead.",
      "quotes": [
        "There is One who is more true than death.",
        "Christ is the telos of the sermon... grace is the deepest of our life."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this focus but ensure Christ is not just a 'solution' to the problem of death, but the Lord of the specific text."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 16 minutes, the sermon falls short of Dekker’s 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for true homiletical 'depth'.",
      "quotes": [
        "I wish that we could linger with Ezekiel this morning. But we must hasten on..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exposition. The 'hastening' noted in the text is a symptom of insufficient time for the Word to breathe."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily due to its length and its attempt to cover two massive texts simultaneously, which prevents the required specificity. The structure is too segmented (exposition then application). However, it succeeds in its sober confrontation with death and its insistence on grace as an external act of God.",
    "strengths": [
      "Theologically robust Christocentrism that avoids making Jesus a mere moral example.",
      "Effective use of 'secular' humanities (Larkin) to diagnose the human condition (misery).",
      "Clear articulation of grace as 'unconditional' and 'outside' human merit."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (under 20 minutes) limits the depth of the 're-creation' of the Word.",
      "Lack of interwovenness; the sermon moves in blocks rather than a single movement of revelation.",
      "Specific 'uniqueness' of the text is sacrificed for a general (though strong) theme of resurrection."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a strong speech with high theological integrity, but it is not yet a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense because it lacks the necessary breadth (duration) and the radical specificity of a single pericope."
