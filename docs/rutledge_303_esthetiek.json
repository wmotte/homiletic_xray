    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery effectively to bridge the gap between the ancient text and the 1997 context. The contrast between 'cyberspace' and the 'Apostolic flame' serves as a central visual anchor. However, the imagery often leans toward the conceptual rather than the purely sensory. While the preacher mentions the 'stench' of the world implicitly through the contrast with the Spirit, the descriptions of biblical scenes remain somewhat traditional. The use of the stained-glass windows as a visual aid is a strong homiletical move, turning the physical space into a 'living' image. Yet, the metaphors for the Spirit (wind, flame) are largely inherited from the biblical text rather than freshly minted for the contemporary ear, which limits the 'aesthetic surprise' Cilliers advocates for.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably precise and exhibits high 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre). The preacher makes a conscious effort to define terms and correct linguistic 'fashions' with theological rigor. The distinction between the Spirit as an 'it' versus a 'he' is handled with grammatical and theological care. There is a clear avoidance of 'Canaanite jargon' by explaining terms like 'apostolos' and 'duende'. The sentence structure is clean and hits the core of the argument without unnecessary fluff. However, the insistence on gendered pronouns, while argued as a matter of precision, may create a linguistic barrier for some hearers, potentially closing the 'open work' for a modern audience.",

        "The Holy Spirit is not a what and not an it... The Spirit is a ‘who,’ not a ‘what.’",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a dignified, rhythmic cadence suitable for an Episcopal/Anglican setting. There is a clear use of parallelism ('power for life, power for service, power for ministry') that aids memorability. The transition from the 'smallness' of the congregation to the 'trillions' of comets creates a rhythmic expansion and contraction of the hearer's perspective. However, some sections are heavy with scripture quotations, which, while authoritative, can interrupt the natural 'flow' and musicality of the preacher's own voice. It feels more like a well-crafted essay (paper language) than a spontaneous oral performance, though the invitation to stand at the end breaks this mold.",

    "average_score_language": 6.33,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by 'sober beauty' and linguistic precision. The preacher excels in 'stewardship of language,' treating words as vital tools for truth. While the imagery is effective—particularly the contrast between the digital age and the apostolic age—it occasionally relies on traditional tropes. The musicality is steady and dignified, though it lacks the high poetic intensity found in more 'imagistic' homiletics. It is a text that values clarity and theological accuracy over aesthetic experimentation, resulting in a reliable but somewhat predictable micro-aesthetic experience."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with an 'upsetting of equilibrium'—the preacher feeling 'foolish and small' in the face of the internet's scale. This creates immediate tension. The movement then shifts from this modern anxiety to the biblical grounding of the Spirit's power. The turning point is the transition from 'disciples' (learners) to 'apostles' (sent ones), which is then applied to the congregation. The energy remains high because the preacher moves from a global/cosmic scale down to the specific 'Salisbury, Connecticut' context. The invitation to stand serves as a physical 'climax' to the narrative arc, moving the sermon from a lecture to an event.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong point of the sermon. The preacher 'reframes' (Cilliers) the 22 million internet hits through the lens of Genesis and Pentecost. The ancient text is not just a relic; it is positioned as the 'irresistible power' that outlasts cyberspace. The integration of the local context (the young man's memorial, the stained-glass windows, the upcoming church meeting) makes the theology 'operative' (Immink). The sermon successfully bridges the 'then' of Jerusalem with the 'now' of Salisbury. It respects the 'strangeness' of the Spirit (the wind that blows where it wills) while making it relevant to a 20th-century technological society.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Spirit... is not going to be put in the shade by the World Wide Web.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Aesthetically, the sermon leans toward a 'closed' structure. While the preacher uses an 'invitation' at the end, the theological conclusions are presented as definitive and somewhat binary ('If it never happened, we should shut down...'). There is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or the 'polyvalence' Stark advocates for. The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long) but also as a teacher who corrects 'fashions'. While this provides clarity, it reduces the 'space for the hearer' to wrestle with the mystery of the Spirit. The ending is an 'open' blessing, but the path to get there is strictly paved with dogmatic certainties.",
      "quotes": [
        "If it never happened, we should shut down St. John’s this very day.",
        "It means that the message they carried to the world really is the truth...",
        "I am going to ask you to do something... it is an invitation, not an order."

      "strengths": [
        "The invitation to stand creates a literal 'space' for the hearer to respond.",
        "The focus on 'each' having a gift opens a door for personal appropriation.",
        "The preacher is honest about their own initial feelings of smallness."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Allow more room for the 'mystery' of the Spirit without needing to 'correct' every linguistic fashion.",
        "Pose more open-ended questions that allow the hearer to find their own 'gift' rather than telling them they 'will' find it.",
        "Avoid 'all or nothing' ultimatums (e.g., 'shut down the church') which can feel coercive."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent; a 'closed' system of truths intended to restore confidence."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are characterized by a strong narrative arc and excellent contextual integration. The preacher successfully 'reframes' the modern digital reality within the ancient Pentecost event. The structure is dynamic, moving from personal doubt to corporate empowerment. However, the sermon is aesthetically 'closed' in its dogmatic certainty, leaving less room for the hearer's own interpretation or the 'polyphony' of the Spirit. The physical invitation at the end is a strong dramaturgical move that saves the sermon from being merely a lecture."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids religious kitsch by grounding its claims in historical reality and the 'hard work' of love and communication. It does not offer a 'happy ending' without first acknowledging the feeling of being 'foolish and small.' However, there is a slight risk of 'triumphalist kitsch' in the dismissal of the internet's scale—a quick move to 'God is bigger' that might bypass the genuine existential crisis of the church's perceived irrelevance. The mention of the memorial service provides 'authentic depth' (Immink) that prevents the sermon from becoming a clichéd celebration.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The somewhat easy 'restoration to confidence' after just 'a few minutes' of feeling small.",
      "The use of 'rattling off words' as a setup for a pre-determined 'new look'."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission of feeling 'foolish and small' in the face of 22 million hits.",
      "The reference to the young man's memorial and the 'work of love' in learning languages."

    "recommendation": "To increase depth, spend more time in the 'smallness' before the 'restoration,' allowing the tension between the digital age and the church to be fully felt."

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is opened through the concept of 'gifts bestowed on us' and the invitation to participate in the 'apostolic flame.' Cilliers' 'Space for Grace' is present in the emphasis on the Spirit as a gift from 'beyond ourselves.' However, the space is partially 'closed' by the preacher's firm boundary-setting regarding language and the 'fraud' of faith if certain historical claims aren't met. The 'mystery' of the Spirit is mentioned but then immediately categorized. Grace prevails in the final blessing, but the path to it feels more like a 'task' of correct belief than a 'space' of pure reception.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between the 'world' and the 'Spirit' are sustained initially but resolved fairly quickly through dogmatic assertion.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery is acknowledged ('wind blows where it wills') but then 'corrected' by specific gendered and Trinitarian definitions.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails, particularly in the emphasis on the Spirit 'building you up' rather than 'demanding from you.'",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'un-pinnable' nature of the Spirit to remain a bit more 'un-pinned' to create a larger 'space for grace' and wonder."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "The sermon 'The Apostolic Flame' is a well-crafted example of 'Sober-Reformed/Anglican' aesthetics. Its primary strength lies in its 'stewardship of language' and its ability to 'reframe' the contemporary technological context (the 1997 internet boom) within the ancient narrative of Pentecost. The preacher effectively uses the physical environment of the church to ground abstract theological concepts. Dramaturgically, the sermon is successful, moving from a personal 'upsetting of equilibrium' to a corporate call to action. Aesthetically, however, it is a 'closed' work. It prioritizes theological precision and the correction of 'fashions' over the 'polyvalence' and 'openness' that allow a modern hearer to inhabit the text. The imagery is clear but lacks sensory richness, and the musicality is dignified but not poetic. It is a sermon that 'witnesses' with authority but perhaps leaves too little room for the 'inter-esse'—the space between the preacher's certainty and the hearer's possible doubt.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the digital age through the lens of Pentecost.",
      "Effective use of the 'Homiletical Plot' to move from personal insignificance to corporate power.",
      "Precision in language and the avoidance of empty religious jargon."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase 'openness' by allowing for more mystery and fewer binary 'all-or-nothing' statements.",
      "Enrich the 'poetics' with more sensory, cinematic imagery ('Show, don't tell').",
      "Soften the 'pedagogical' tone to allow the 'performance' of the Spirit to be more unbidden."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Academic-Declarative with Narrative elements.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Thomas G. Long's 'Preacher as Witness' and Paul Scott Wilson's 'Four Pages' (Trouble/Grace balance), but lacks the 'Open Work' quality of Ciska Stark.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to intellectually engaged, traditional congregants who value clarity, historical continuity, and theological rigor.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'open ending' that leaves the congregation with a reflective question.",
      "Incorporate more 'sensory' descriptions of the biblical scenes to evoke a 'cinematic' experience.",
      "Try to sustain the 'trouble' or the 'mystery' longer before providing the theological 'correction'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This is a solid, aesthetically 'good' sermon (6.5) that excels in clarity and contextual integration. It avoids the pitfalls of kitsch through its intellectual honesty and local grounding. While it lacks the 'poetic fire' or 'interpretive openness' of a model aesthetic sermon (8+), it serves as a strong example of how to bring an ancient text into dialogue with a rapidly changing world. It is a 'sober' performance where the 'holy happens' through the restoration of confidence in the apostolic tradition."
