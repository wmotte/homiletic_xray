[...] We must utter it, because the God of Moses has no other access point in the unglued city, except to haunt with trembling by poetic lips. Those lips do indeed cause a deep trembling, for the one who utters and for those who hear.",
    "notes": "The sermon follows a Brueggemann-esque prophetic-imagination style, heavily reliant on poetic rhetoric and the tension between tradition and contemporary numbness."

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon lacks a traditional 'hook' or a personal narrative to ground the hearer. Instead of starting with a recognizable life situation, it begins with an abstract theological condition (the 'If'). While it eventually touches on concrete issues like health care and housing, these are presented as categories of social failure rather than lived, empathetic experiences. The 'feeling' level is primarily one of 'raw terror' or 'haunting' rather than identification with characters.",

      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest phase. It excels at analyzing the human condition of 'numbness' and 'denial.' It explores the 'why' behind the Jerusalem establishment's failure—their faith had become a narcotic. It provides a sharp cultural critique of 'therapeutic culture' and 'secularism,' forcing the hearer to look at the 'problem' of God's conditionality from multiple angles.",

It connects various biblical traditions (Moses, David, Solomon, Jeremiah) into a cohesive theological framework of sovereignty and moral demand. However, it avoids traditional dogmatic terminology in favor of poetic concepts, which may leave the 'logical' learner wanting more systematic clarity.",

The application remains at the level of 'vocation' and 'memory' rather than specific ethical implementation in the daily life of the hearer.",

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a diagnostic success but a pedagogical fragment. It excels in the 'Interpretive' and 'Normative' tasks of Osmer, providing a profound wisdom-based analysis of why society is 'unglued.' However, by explicitly rejecting 'application,' it halts the Kolb cycle prematurely. The priority for improvement is not in the quality of the thought—which is high—but in the 'Pragmatic' quadrant. To move from a 5.5 to a 7 or 8, the preacher must find a way to let the 'haunting poetry' lead to 'concrete neighbor-care' without falling into the 'technical control' or 'moralism' he fears. As it stands, it is a brilliant 'Visionary' piece that risks leaving the hearer in a state of 'trembling' without a path toward 'doing'."
