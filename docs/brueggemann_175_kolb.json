    "sermon_start_end": "Before we started worrying about polyunsaturated fats, meat was the well-established measure of a well-consumed life. If you were successful, you could eat meat several times a day. You could serve up rich banquets with multiple meats to exhibit your success. [...] This is a moment when Jesus calls yet again to his disciples, away from the table of much meat, from every idol, saying, “Christian, love me more than these.”",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a highly relatable 'slice of life' regarding meat consumption as a status symbol. It successfully bridges the gap between the ancient text and modern experience by using visceral imagery of food and success. However, it moves quickly into historical analysis, which slightly distances the immediate emotional connection.",
      "quotes": [
        "Before we started worrying about polyunsaturated fats, meat was the well-established measure of a well-consumed life.",
        "Imagine the logistics of maintaining that food supply! Think how much it takes to supply thirty measures of meal every day."

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength of the sermon. The preacher pauses extensively to ask 'why' Solomon acted this way and 'why' the modern hearer is trapped in an anxiety system. It offers a sharp cultural critique that forces the hearer to look at their world from a different perspective.",
      "quotes": [

      "quotes": [
        "The creator God sustains a system of abundance.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the sermon calls for a 'vocation of justice,' the steps remain largely conceptual (e.g., 'refuse the passion for anxiety'). It lacks specific, 'Monday morning' instructions for the individual hearer to implement change in their specific context.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_kolb_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of prophetic-reflective preaching that excels in cultural analysis and theological framing. It successfully identifies the 'anxiety system' of modern life by using the biblical narrative of Solomon's excess as a mirror. However, it falls short of completing the Kolb cycle because it remains largely in the realm of 'Reflective Observation' and 'Abstract Conceptualization.' The preacher acts as a brilliant 'Advocate' and 'Artist,' but less as a 'Guide' or 'Coach.' The hearer is given a profound new way to see the world (Visionary) and a logical reason to reject the status quo (Declarative), but is not equipped with the specific 'Active Experimentation' steps needed to embody this new reality in a concrete way. The language is sober and the analysis of the biblical text is integrated well with contemporary economic realities.",

      "Bridge the gap between 'systemic justice' and 'personal spiritual practice'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a highly effective diagnostic tool that helps the congregation understand the 'why' and 'what' of their spiritual malaise. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon that prioritizes reflection and conceptualization over application. While it is a model for how to perform cultural critique through a biblical lens, its impact is limited by the lack of concrete 'Active Experimentation.' The priority for improvement is to move from the 'what' (theology) to the 'how' (practice), ensuring that the visionary insights are translated into lived discipleship."
