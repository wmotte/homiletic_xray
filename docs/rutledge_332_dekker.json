[...] And at the very same moment (this is the glory of Good Friday) you will come to know the true reality, the true joy and gladness, of the good news of salvation in Jesus Christ our Lord."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon lacks a specific pericope as its foundation. It begins with a brief reference to Matthew 11:6 but quickly abandons it to tell anecdotal stories about 'Sally' and 'Jane'. It treats the Bible as a source of general themes (the Cross, sin) rather than recreating a specific written Word into a current proclamatory word.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus replied with a definition of his ministry and then said, 'Blessed is he who takes no offense at me' (Matthew 11:6). Yet, we are repeatedly told throughout the four Gospels, people did just that. Here is the story of two women who took offense at him."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one specific text (e.g., the trial before Pilate or the specific dialogue in Matthew 11) and extract what is unique to that passage rather than using it as a springboard for character sketches."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "There is virtually no exegesis. The preacher does not engage with the original context of John the Baptist’s doubt or the linguistic nuances of 'offense' (skandalon). The historical and theological context of Israel or the specific intent of the Evangelist is absent.",
      "quotes": [
        "Apparently John could not understand why Jesus had not begun to exercise his Messianic authority..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Engage with the Greek text and the specific theological tension in the passage. Why did John specifically take offense? What was the 'religious history' behind his expectation?"
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Application is the sermon's strongest point, though it leans heavily on 'religious psychology'. The anecdotes of the department store and the 'domineering' church member are concrete and recognizable in the zeitgeist. However, it risks becoming a psychological lecture rather than a scriptural application.",
      "quotes": [
        "The really bad part was the feeling of being treated like a common criminal!",
        "She was manipulative, domineering, willful, and unforgiving."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application flows from the text's unique voice rather than from general psychological observations about 'good people' versus 'sinners'."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Because there is so little exposition, the 'interwoveness' is lopsided. The hearer is drawn into the stories of Sally and Jane, but not into the biblical text itself. The 'present' of revelation is replaced by the 'present' of the anecdote.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have one more little story to tell. This is another story about Sally..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Use the biblical narrative as the primary movement. The hearer should be 'expounded' by the text, not just by the preacher's stories."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon addresses 'misery' (sin as blindness/pride) and 'redemption' (Christ as the common criminal). However, it remains somewhat 'objective' and descriptive of others' misery rather than bringing the hearer to their own misery before God.",
      "quotes": [
        "In her stubborn blindness, Jane could not identify herself as a sinner like all the rest of us.",
        "How do we measure the gravity of sin... By looking at the magnitude of what God has done for us in Jesus."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond describing the 'misery' of Sally and Jane and confront the congregation's specific misery before the holiness of God."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon hints at the 'two ways' by discussing those who 'take offense' versus those who 'hear'. It addresses being 'lost in time' (blindness to one's own nature), but the ultimate stakes of eternity or the radicality of the narrow way are muted by the anecdotal tone.",
      "quotes": [
        "Sally could not hear the message of Good Friday, Jane could not hear it, but perhaps you can hear it today..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must realize the possibility of being lost more sharply. The choice is not just about 'feeling' better or being 'less blind', but about life and destruction."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, specifically as the one who takes the place of the 'common criminal'. The doctrine of the two natures is implicit in the idea of God doing this 'for our sake'. However, Christ often feels like an illustration for the psychological point about shame.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus, who became like a common criminal for our sake and in our place."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure Christ is not just the 'solution' to a psychological problem of 'unrecognized guilt', but the Lord who confronts and saves."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 11-12 minutes, the sermon fails Dekker’s requirement for 'breadth'. It lacks the theological depth that requires a longer duration; it is a 'meditation' rather than a full sermon.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical foundation and the theological implications of the Cross to reach the 20-minute threshold of 'depth'."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "This text functions more as a moral-psychological meditation than a sermon according to Dekker's criteria. It lacks a specific biblical pericope as its starting point, substituting exegesis with anecdotal storytelling. While it effectively identifies the 'misery' of self-righteousness, it fails to ground this in the unique voice of a specific Scripture passage.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application to the 'zeitgeist' of the self-righteous 'good person'.",
      "Clear identification of Christ's substitutionary role as the 'common criminal'."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Total absence of formal exegesis or engagement with original languages/context.",
      "Lack of a specific Bible passage; the text is used as a pretext for stories.",
      "Insufficient length to achieve the 'breadth' required for theological depth."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the strict sense of Dekker’s definition. It is a thematic speech about 'the cross' and 'sin' illustrated by anecdotes. It fails the formal requirement of being an 'exposition and application of a specific Bible passage'."
