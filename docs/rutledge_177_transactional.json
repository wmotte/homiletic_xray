    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Rescuer' homiletics. While it uses beautiful, high-affect language to describe God's love, it psychologically anchors that love in the listener's total inadequacy. By reviving the 'miserable offender' trope, it bypasses the Adult ego and creates a Parent-Child dependency. The psychological impact is a 'relief' that comes from surrendering autonomy, which Berne would identify as a negative payoff because it inhibits the growth of the Adult.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as capable Adults who can choose to respond to God, rather than 'self-destructive children' who must be rescued. Reduce the use of 'must' and 'no health' to allow the listener's Free Child to experience joy without the prerequisite of shame."
