    "sermon_start_end": "In the mid-nineteenth century, the great Danish philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard, wrote a difficult complex book he called Stages of Faith. Kierkegaard proposed that maturation in faith requires two moves, first to a second stage and then to a third stage; he saw that each move is very difficult and demanding. [...] It is no wonder that Jesus said to the disciples: 'For mortals it is impossible, but not for God; for God all things are possible.' (Mark 10:27) October 21, 2018"

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's requirement of focusing on one specific pericope. It treats three distinct texts (Mark, Job, Amos) as illustrations for a philosophical framework (Kierkegaard). The specificity of 'what THIS text says that is nowhere else' is lost in a thematic synthesis.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have two case studies of such ethical persons in our readings today.",
        "The matter is different again in our final reading from Amos..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one pericope (e.g., Mark 10) and explore its unique internal logic rather than using it as a 'case study' for a philosophical stage."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher shows awareness of the Torah and the 'village gate' in Amos, but the exegesis is subservient to the 'Stages of Faith' structure. The original context of the rich man's question is flattened into a modern psychological category.",
      "quotes": [
        "The village gate being the venue for judicial decisions by the village elders.",
        "Jesus refers him to the Torah of Moses. He mentions five of the Ten Commandments..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the linguistic and historical tension of the specific text. For instance, the specific meaning of 'defraud' in the context of a wealthy landowner in Mark 10."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is somewhat concrete regarding social justice and 'liberal' identity, but it remains largely intellectual. It addresses the 'zeitgeist' of the ethical person but lacks the sharp, specific 'now' that Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "He sounds to me like a good liberal that most of us aspire to be.",
        "Second-stage folk like us count on all of that."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond identifying with 'types' (the liberal, the ethical person) to concrete contemporary situations where the 'free fall' of faith is currently required."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a lecture-like structure: Kierkegaard's theory followed by biblical examples. While the examples are analyzed, the 'present of revelation' is hindered by the heavy philosophical scaffolding.",
      "quotes": [
        "Kierkegaard’s first stage need not deter us long.",
        "The second stage for Kierkegaard is what he called 'the ethical.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Let the text lead the movement. Instead of fitting the text into Kierkegaard's stages, let the exposition of the text itself create the application."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The 'misery' of the ethical person's self-reliance is well-articulated. 'Redemption' is present as the 'mystery of God,' though it leans more toward the 'objective' side which Dekker warns against if not balanced.",
      "quotes": [
        "You are still restless in your virtue, because you lack one thing.",
        "It is about abandoning self and relying in free fall on the hiddenness of God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'misery' of the rich man more than just a psychological 'restlessness'; show it as the radical lostness before God."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is a strong point. The sermon emphasizes the 'quantum leap' and the possibility of the man 'not making the move.' It takes the choice and the possibility of loss (temporal/spiritual) seriously.",
      "quotes": [
        "He resolved to keep his stuff even if it may cost him 'abiding significance' of his life.",
        "The man who meets Jesus could not make the move; he had great possessions!"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Clarify the 'eternal' dimension of this loss to match the 'temporal' loss of purpose mentioned."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ appears as a teacher or a 'call to discipleship' (telos), but His nature as God (the two natures) is not the driving force. Grace is mentioned at the end, but it feels like a concluding thought rather than the sermon's heartbeat.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus undertook a mighty risk in his identity with the poor and calls his disciples to do the same.",
        "For mortals it is impossible, but not for God..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Anchor the 'possibility' of God (Mark 10:27) more firmly in the person of Christ as the one who fulfills what is impossible for man."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 14.5 minutes, the sermon falls significantly short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for true 'depth.'",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exposition of a single text to allow the biblical logic to breathe, rather than jumping between three texts."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon functions more as a theological lecture on Kierkegaardian stages than as a 'recreation of the Bible into a new, current, proclamatory word.' It violates the fundamental rule of focusing on one specific passage, resulting in a thematic survey. While it correctly identifies the 'misery' of moralism and the seriousness of the 'two ways,' it lacks the necessary length and Christological depth required by Dekker.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective diagnosis of the 'ethical stage' as a form of self-control.",
      "Clear articulation of the 'two ways' through the rich man's refusal.",
      "Avoidance of easy, general truths by emphasizing God's freedom ('perhaps')."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Failure to focus on a single Bible passage (Thesis 1.3).",
      "Insufficient length to achieve necessary depth (Thesis 8).",
      "Over-reliance on philosophical categories (Kierkegaard) which should 'sleep' during the sermon."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an insightful religious address, but according to Dekker’s strict formal criteria, it is not a sermon because it lacks a single specific scriptural foundation and the required breadth for depth."
