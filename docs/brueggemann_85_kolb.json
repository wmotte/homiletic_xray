    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a rhythmic, poetic opening about 'seeing' and 'noticing,' which functions as a cognitive hook. However, it lacks a specific, contemporary 'slice of life' story to anchor the experience in the hearer's immediate world. The concrete experience is primarily mediated through the biblical narrative of the blind man rather than a modern equivalent. The emotional connection is established through the man's irritation and the parents' fear, which are recognizable human emotions, but the sermon stays largely within the world of the text for the first two-thirds.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a significant strength of the sermon. The preacher excels at analyzing the human condition through the lens of 'managed truth' versus 'new possibility.' He pauses to explore the 'why' behind the authorities' resistance—identifying it as a threat to control and entitlement. The sermon offers a sharp cultural critique of how we are 'nurtured not to see,' forcing the hearer to reflect on their own defensive 'arch of the back' when confronted with change.",
      "quotes": [
        "The reason they want to get to the bottom of this is that it did not fit their categories of understanding and control.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The theological exposition is solid, focusing on Christology (the Son of Man) and the nature of 'judgment' as the adjudication of truth. The 'big idea' is the contrast between old managed systems and the 'strange surge of God.' While the exegesis is more thematic than technical, it successfully formulates a biblical truth about the disruptive nature of Jesus. The theological framework of 'emergents' versus 'free fall' provides a logical structure for the latter half of the sermon.",

While it lists areas for decision (race, class, gender, market ideology), it lacks specific 'how-to' steps for the hearer. The call to 'worship, give thanks, obey, and bear witness' is a standard liturgical response but doesn't provide a concrete 'experiment' for the coming week. The application is more about a change in 'seeing' (internal) than a specific 'doing' (external).",

    "summary": "The sermon is a rhetorically sophisticated piece that excels in Reflective Observation and Visionary language. It effectively uses the biblical narrative of John 9 to create a compelling contrast between 'managed truth' and 'gospel possibility.' The preacher's strength lies in his ability to analyze the 'why' of human and institutional resistance, providing the hearer with deep intellectual and imaginative insights. However, the sermon falls short of a complete Kolb cycle due to a lack of concrete, contemporary experience in the introduction and a relatively weak pragmatic application at the end. The application remains at the level of 'deciding' and 'worshipping' without providing specific handles for daily ethical living. It primarily serves the Diverging and Assimilating learning styles, while leaving the Converging learner (who asks 'How does this work?') largely unaddressed.",

    "conclusion": "This is a strong, intellectually stimulating sermon that functions well as a 'Visionary' call to a new perspective. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon—excellent at reflection and conceptualization, but lighter on concrete experience and active experimentation. It successfully moves the hearer to 'see' differently, which is the preacher's stated goal, but it may fail to move the hearer to 'act' differently in a measurable way. The priority for improvement is to ground the high-level theological vision in the grit of daily practice and specific contemporary experience. It is a well-crafted example of 'Prophetic Discernment' (Osmer) but requires more 'Servant Leadership' (Osmer) to equip the congregation for the 'how' of the gospel life."
