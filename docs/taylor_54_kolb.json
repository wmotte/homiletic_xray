If I go, I will come and take you to be with me — forever.",

      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a strong connection to the immediate context of the 10th anniversary and the 'pilgrim' history of the church. It effectively uses developmental milestones (infancy to old age) to ground the abstract concept of 'searching' in recognizable life stages. The preacher successfully evokes empathy through the imagery of the 'bawling infant' and the 'blushing teenager.' However, it remains somewhat generalized rather than providing a singular, deep narrative for the hearer to inhabit.",

      "analysis": "The sermon pauses to reflect on the nature of the 'search' and the human condition of incompleteness. It explores the cultural background of the Greeks and the psychological drive to 'matter.' While it identifies the problem of human restlessness, it often moves quickly to the solution (Jesus) without fully dwelling on the 'why' of the existential tension or the cultural complexities of modern searching.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Theological depth is somewhat thin. The sermon relies heavily on the repetition of the phrase 'Sir, we would see Jesus' as a liturgical refrain rather than a springboard for deep exegesis. The 'big idea' is clear (Jesus is the answer to every search), but the logical connection between the text and the dogmatic claims is more associative than argumentative. The exegesis of John 12 is minimal, focusing only on the request of the Greeks without exploring the context of Jesus' subsequent discourse on the grain of wheat.",

It offers beautiful invitations to 'carry' things to Jesus, but lacks specific 'how-to' steps for the hearer's Monday-to-Saturday life. The calls to action are largely internal and pietistic ('Get hold of him right there') rather than ethical or missional.

    "summary": "The sermon is a rhetorically elegant, visionary exploration of the human search for God, framed by the 10th anniversary of a local church. It is strongest in its ability to evoke emotion and imagination (Diverging style), using a wide array of metaphors from literature, art, and personal history. It successfully grounds the biblical text in the universal human experience of longing and mortality. However, the sermon falls short in the 'Thinking' and 'Doing' quadrants. The theological exegesis is secondary to the thematic repetition of the 'search,' and the practical application remains largely internal and devotional. While it provides a deep sense of comfort and inspiration, it lacks the logical rigor and concrete ethical challenges necessary for a fully balanced experiential learning cycle. It is a 'priestly' and 'visionary' sermon that excels at 'seeing' Jesus but provides fewer handles for 'following' him in specific, everyday actions.",

      "Use more 'Declarative' logic to explain *why* Jesus is the answer, not just *that* he is."
    ],
    "conclusion": "From a Kolb perspective, this sermon is a strong example of the 'Visionary' and 'Diverging' quadrants. It excels at creating a 'Concrete Experience' of longing and providing 'Reflective Observation' on the human condition. Its primary diagnosis is a lack of balance: it favors the 'Heart' and 'Eyes' over the 'Head' and 'Hands.' While it is a rhetorically effective anniversary message, its pedagogical impact is limited by its avoidance of concrete application and deep theological argumentation. The priority for improvement is to move the hearer from 'seeing' Jesus as a poetic solution to 'experimenting' with his Lordship in concrete, ethical, and missional ways."
