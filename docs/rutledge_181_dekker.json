  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon treats two distinct passages as separate entities rather than a unified whole. While it identifies the Trinitarian benediction and the De Profundis, it struggles to find what is unique to these texts that cannot be found elsewhere. The treatment of 2 Cor 13:13 relies heavily on a general 'parental' analogy rather than the specific apostolic authority or the context of the Corinthian crisis.",
      "quotes": [
        "One specific Bible passage underlies the sermon; not the Bible as a whole...",
        "The church that was breaking his heart is the one that gets the full Trinitarian blessing."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus on the specific linguistic tension of the 'fear' resulting from 'forgiveness' in Psalm 130:4. Why is this paradox unique to this text?"

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is thin. There is no engagement with the original languages (Hebrew/Greek) as Dekker requires. The historical context of the Corinthian correspondence is mentioned vaguely ('agonized portion'), but it lacks the depth of scholarly humanities or religious history. It relies more on liturgical history (Book of Common Prayer) than biblical exegesis.",
      "quotes": [
        "In desperation he writes an impassioned, erratic letter...",
        "Over the centuries, these 'depths' have been plumbed by countless sufferers..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the specific theological weight of 'koinonia' in the Greek or the cultic significance of 'redemption' in the Hebrew context of the Temple."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete in its psychological observations (addiction, anorexia), which aligns with Dekker's view on reclaiming space from psychologists. However, it often veers into 'general truths' about love and parents, which Dekker warns against.",
      "quotes": [
        "Maybe he is hooked on drugs and failing in school, maybe she is anorexic...",
        "Human love is a glimmer of the full radiance of God’s love."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the 'glimmer' analogy which borders on general natural theology; instead, apply the specific 'misery' of the Corinthian rejection of Paul to a modern ecclesiastical situation."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a pattern of 'illustration first, text second.' This separates the hearer from the text initially. The exposition of the Psalm is better integrated than the 2 Corinthians section, but they remain somewhat distinct blocks.",
      "quotes": [
        "Imagine for a moment that you are the parent...",
        "This is the movement of Psalm 130..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Start directly with the text's own 'voice' to draw the hearer into the scriptural world immediately rather than using an external 'hook'."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Strongest point. The sermon explicitly tackles 'misery' (miserable offenders) and 'redemption'. It refuses to soften the human condition, which Dekker would appreciate. It correctly identifies misery as 'before God'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The depth of which the psalmist is actually speaking here is the depth of the knowledge that he and everyone else is a 'miserable offender.'",
        "there is no health in us."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Develop the 'gratitude' (sanctification) aspect more clearly; the sermon ends on redemption but lacks the 'new life' in concrete action."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on the 'impulse toward self-destruction' and being 'lost'. It takes the human condition seriously. However, the 'eternal loss' is somewhat muted in favor of 'temporal loss' (addiction, etc.).",
      "quotes": [
        "the 'vast primordial catastrophe' is met by nothing less than the purpose of an all-powerful Father...",
        "the God who pursues us even beyond the grave..."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the source of grace and the incarnate love. However, the sermon occasionally slips into a general 'Theism' or 'Trinitarianism' where the specific work of Christ as the 'telos' is slightly diffused by the parental analogies.",
      "quotes": [
        "God’s love spends itself to the very last drop of the blood of the Son.",
        "the love that has become incarnate in history through Jesus Christ..."

      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 14.5 minutes, the sermon fails Dekker’s 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for 'depth'. By combining two separate liturgical occasions, it sacrifices the specific focus needed for a single pericope.",
      "quotes": [
        "A sermon that lasts less than 20 minutes cannot be a sermon."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegesis of a single passage to reach the 20-minute mark, allowing the text to breathe."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily due to its insufficient length and the lack of rigorous linguistic/historical exegesis. It functions more as a liturgical meditation than a 'recreation of the Bible into a new, current, proclamatory word.' However, its refusal to shy away from human 'misery' and its psychological concreteness are strong points.",
    "strengths": [
      "Honest confrontation with human sin and misery ('miserable offenders').",
      "Concrete psychological application that avoids vague moralism.",
      "Clear Trinitarian framework."

    "weaknesses": [
      "Duration is significantly below the 20-minute threshold for depth.",
      "Lack of engagement with original biblical languages and scholarly exegesis.",
      "Over-reliance on general human analogies (parental love) rather than the specific 'nowhere else' of the text."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This text is an adequate liturgical address but, according to Dekker's strict formal definition, it is not yet a 'sermon' because it lacks the necessary breadth (length) and specific exegetical depth."
