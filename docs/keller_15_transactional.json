    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is intellectually rigorous (Adult) but relies on a classic TA 'Game' structure. It first destabilizes the listener's sense of Adult competence by framing life as an uncontrollable sea and the listener as secretly hostile to God (Persecutor/Critical Parent move). Once the listener is in the 'Victim' position of the Drama Triangle, the preacher introduces the Rescuer. While theologically traditional, it risks creating a dependency on the 'Rescuer' by emphasizing human helplessness.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to invite the listener's Adult to observe their own life experiences rather than telling them they are 'self-deceived.' Use more 'Free Child' elements (authentic wonder) rather than just 'Critical Parent' deconstruction."
