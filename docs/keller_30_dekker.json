  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses four distinct pericopes to construct a thematic speech on 'friendship'. This violates Dekker's rule that a sermon is not about a 'biblical character' or 'keyword'. By stringing texts together, the preacher fails to identify what THIS specific text says that can be found nowhere else.",
      "quotes": [
        "we did something a little unusual today, and we gave you four texts.",
        "We’re going to show you how they tell us about the rightly famous friendship between Jonathan and David and what these texts here and what the Bible tell us about the importance of friendship."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one specific pericope (e.g., 1 Samuel 18:1-4) and exhaust its unique theological depth rather than using multiple snippets to support a pre-conceived theme."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher provides a narrative summary and mentions the symbolic act of the robe, but there is no evidence of Greek/Hebrew study or deep engagement with the religious history of Israel. The exegesis is largely psychological and narrative-driven.",
      "quotes": [
        "He accepted that by taking off his robe. That was essentially the same thing as giving David his crown.",
        "One commentator, Eugene Peterson, wrote a commentary on 1 and 2 Samuel..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the specific covenantal language of the Ancient Near East and the theological tension of the kingship in Israel to ground the friendship in more than just interpersonal loyalty."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is psychologically astute, addressing the 'user' culture of New York City. However, it leans heavily on general wisdom and cultural references (Frankenstein) rather than being strictly derived from the text's unique voice.",
      "quotes": [
        "I’ve had person after person over the years who I’ve talked to who in New York City thought they had a lot more friends than they really did.",
        "my most favorite (yeah, it’s kitschy) example of this important principle is the 1935 movie The Bride of Frankenstein"

      "improvement_point": "Reduce reliance on secular cultural illustrations and derive the 'concreteness' of the application directly from the specific details of the biblical narrative."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a 'three-point' structure (Importance, Elements, Power). While exposition and application are mixed within the points, the structure feels more like a lecture on a topic than a movement where the hearer is 'expounded' by the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let’s take a look at what we learn from the relationship of David to Jonathan about the absolute importance of friendship...",
        "1. The absolute importance of friendship. 2. The constituent elements of friendship. 3. The power requisite for friendship."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move away from the 'three-point lecture' format. Allow the text's own movement to dictate the sermon's flow, drawing the hearer into the biblical world immediately."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon effectively addresses misery (loneliness, sin as deceit, the 'monster' state) and redemption (Christ's friendship). Man is clearly the subject in his need for salvation outside himself.",
      "quotes": [
        "You’ll never make it through life without friends. You’ll never become all you ought to be without friends.",
        "You have to know your sins are forgiven. You have to know God sees all the way into the bottom of your heart..."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are largely absent. While 'being lost' is mentioned via the Frankenstein metaphor, the ultimate seriousness of the narrow vs. broad way (eternal or temporal destruction) is not a driving force in the sermon.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are all like that monster groping through the forest saying, 'If I could just find the friend my heart longs for...'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Thematically connect the choice to follow Christ (the Friend) with the biblical reality of the two ways; emphasize that rejecting this 'friendship' leads to being truly lost."

      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos of the sermon. The preacher moves from the human friendship of Jonathan to the sacrificial friendship of Christ, emphasizing grace and the two natures (Jesus as the God-friend).",
      "quotes": [
        "David was saved through Jonathan’s sacrificial friendship, and you can only be saved through Jesus’ sacrificial friendship.",
        "He stayed on the cross. He was constant. He was a true friend."

      "improvement_point": "Avoid making Christ merely the 'perfect version' of a human category (Friend). Ensure His Lordship remains central even while emphasizing His friendship."

  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily by treating the Bible as a source for a thematic speech on 'Friendship' rather than an exposition of a specific passage. It relies on four different texts to build a topical framework, which dilutes the specificity Dekker demands. However, it succeeds in its psychological depth and its clear movement toward Christ as the telos of the message.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christocentric conclusion that links the narrative to the Gospel.",
      "Effective use of the 'three parts' (misery/redemption) through a psychological lens.",
      "Adequate length allowing for theological 'breadth'."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Violates the 'one specific passage' rule by using four disparate texts.",
      "Lacks rigorous exegesis of the original Hebrew/Israelite context.",
      "The 'two ways' (the seriousness of being lost) is underdeveloped and remains mostly metaphorical."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a strong thematic speech with a clear Gospel focus, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense because it lacks a singular, specific biblical starting point and relies too heavily on general truths about friendship."
