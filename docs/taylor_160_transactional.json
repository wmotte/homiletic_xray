By labeling common cultural expressions as 'garbage' and 'filth,' the preacher fosters a 'We vs. They' mentality (Ain't It Awful) and uses fear as the primary motivator for worship. This stunts the 'full growth' it claims to seek by discouraging the Adult's objective inquiry and the Free Child's authentic joy.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Shift from Critical Parent to Adult. Instead of shaming 'flippant' language, invite the congregation to explore the *meaning* of holiness. Replace 'must' and 'should' with invitations to reflect on the 'here-and-now' experience of the Divine. Reduce the 'Ain't It Awful' cultural critiques which only serve to build a false sense of Parent-ego superiority."
