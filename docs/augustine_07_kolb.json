[...] You’ll prove to be an upright person, loving what’s above before all else, and making proper use of what’s here below. You’ll rejoice in the Lord. Being right-minded, you’ll find your delight in him. Your Creator won’t accuse you, and your Redeemer will give you thanks.",

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience through relatable human dynamics, particularly the disappointment in earthly desires and the social reality of slavery/mercantilism. It touches the hearer by exposing common emotional patterns—desiring something until it is attained, then feeling detest. However, it lacks a singular, immersive narrative 'hook' in the modern sense, relying instead on multiple brief 'slices of life'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Or you may love a woman before marrying her, but not after; in fact, you may detest her as intensely after the wedding as you desired her before.",
        "Let’s assume you’re a big merchant. So tell me: if, with regard to some contract, you preferred silver to gold... wouldn’t your associates think you were out of your mind?",

        "The opening is somewhat abstractly liturgical; starting with the merchant or parent analogy would ground the experience faster.",

      "homiletical_manifestations": "Manifests through domestic analogies (marriage, parenting) and economic metaphors (merchants, slaves) that resonate with the audience's social reality."

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength. The preacher pauses extensively at the 'why' of the human condition, exploring the paradox of loving what we cannot see and the disordered nature of human affection. It employs a 'diatribe' style, where the preacher anticipates the hearer's objections and reflects on them from multiple perspectives.",
      "quotes": [
        "Why? Because she hasn’t lived up to your heart’s expectations.",
        "Why do you love silver? 'Because it’s worth a lot.' And why do you prefer gold? 'Because it’s worth even more.'",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The theological exposition is dense and logically structured. The 'big idea' centers on the 'right use' (uti) vs. 'enjoyment' (frui) of created things. It provides a clear theological framework for understanding God as Spirit and Love. However, it relies heavily on proof-texting rather than a sustained exegetical development of a single passage.",

While there are ethical calls (feed the hungry, be faithful), they are often framed as hypothetical or general virtues rather than concrete, immediate action steps.

        "So, use the things of earth appropriately, and you’ll enjoy those of heaven eternally.",
        "I’d feed the hungry, I’d take in strangers, clothe the naked, and ransom captives.",

It falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase, providing general ethical categories rather than concrete action. The movement between human experience (merchants, parents, slaves) and theological truth (God as Spirit and Love) is clear and logically sound. The use of the 'diatribe' method effectively facilitates Reflective Observation by forcing the hearer to confront their own internal contradictions. However, the lack of a specific, practical 'how-to' for the modern hearer (or even the ancient one) makes the transition to 'Active Experimentation' feel like a moralistic list rather than a transformative process.",

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a robust example of Augustinian homiletics, excelling in the interpretive and normative tasks of theology. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon, prioritizing reflection and conceptualization over concrete action. While it brilliantly deconstructs the hearer's disordered loves, it provides a somewhat generic path for reconstruction. It is highly effective for the 'Assimilating' learner who seeks logical and theological clarity, but it may leave the 'Accommodating' learner feeling intellectually full but practically unequipped. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'upright heart' and the 'busy hands' of the congregation."
