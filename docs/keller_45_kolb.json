    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience primarily through the use of specific, recognizable illustrations and the sensory details of the biblical text. It avoids abstract 'everyman' examples in favor of specific references like Costco or The Lion King. However, it falls short of a 7 or 8 because it spends more time analyzing the *meaning* of the experience than letting the hearer *dwell* in the feeling of the experience itself. The emotional connection is mediated through intellectual observation rather than direct narrative immersion.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength of the sermon. The preacher excels at pausing to ask 'why' and exploring the human condition from multiple perspectives (skeptical, philosophical, existential). He identifies the 'problem'—the irretrievability of life and the inadequacy of secular hope—and explores it thoroughly before offering the theological solution. He engages with cultural critiques (Epicurus, Lion King) to help the hearer observe their own underlying paradigms.",
      "quotes": [
        "What could that possibly symbolize? What lesson in how to live life could that possibly symbolize?",
        "Is your paradigm this life is all there is?",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition from observation to conceptualization is very rapid, sometimes moving into 'answer mode' before the reflection fully settles.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is theoretically dense and logically rigorous. It provides a clear 'big idea' (Resurrection as paradigm-shattering fact, key to Scripture, and source of hope). The exegesis is solid, particularly the section on Paul’s 'case study' which explains the theological necessity of a suffering Messiah. It moves from the specific text to broad dogmatic frameworks (substitutionary atonement, new creation) with ease.",

      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase of the sermon. While the sermon is highly persuasive and evocative, it lacks concrete action steps or specific ethical calls. The application remains largely internal and cognitive ('Do you believe?', 'You should want this'). It facilitates a change in *perspective* but does not provide a clear 'how-to' for living out this hope in the coming week.

It begins by grounding the resurrection in concrete, historical reality, effectively countering modern symbolic interpretations. It then moves into a masterful reflective phase, analyzing the human condition and the 'irretrievability' of life. The theological conceptualization is the sermon's peak, providing a cohesive biblical-theological framework for the resurrection. However, the sermon is significantly unbalanced in its lack of 'Active Experimentation.' It provides a 'vision' of hope but fails to equip the hearer with concrete 'active' responses or ethical implications for daily life. The movement is from the head to the heart, but it stops before reaching the hands.",

    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Strategic advice 1: Dedicate the final 20% of the sermon to 'Active Experimentation'—what does this look like in the office, the home, or the city?",
      "Strategic advice 2: Use a 'Pragmatic' structure for one of the main points (e.g., 'How to live as a witness').",
      "Strategic advice 3: Incorporate a 'Narrative' opening that allows the hearer to feel the 'Concrete Experience' of the text before the 'Reflective Observation' begins."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a high-quality intellectual and existential defense of the Christian hope, scoring strongly in the 'Reflective Observation' and 'Abstract Conceptualization' phases of Kolb's cycle. It successfully deconstructs secular paradigms and offers a robust theological alternative. Its primary deficiency lies in the 'Pragmatic' task; it informs and inspires but does not explicitly transform insight into action. For an audience of skeptics or 'assimilating' learners, it is highly effective. For a congregation seeking guidance on how to embody the 'power from on high' in a practical sense, it remains incomplete. The priority for improvement is the intentional integration of the 'Active Experimentation' phase to complete the learning cycle."
