    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in high-stakes preaching. It utilizes a strong Nurturing Parent ego state to provide 'strokes' (recognition and validation) to a community under extreme pressure. By framing the congregation's struggle within the 'Adult' reality of global attention and the 'Free Child' joy of the Resurrection, the preacher fosters resilience rather than passive compliance. The use of 'we' and 'our' prevents the preacher from falling into a Persecutor role, creating a shared Adult-Adult/Parent-Child bond that promotes communal health.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of 'Stroking' for a marginalized group.",

      "Strong integration of Adult reality-testing with Child-like hope."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Slight risk of 'Smothering' NP if the promise of 'peace some day' is used to bypass the need for immediate Adult-level safety planning (though contextually unlikely here)."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using the 'Adult' to process the 'Here-and-Now' social consequences of faith, as this empowers the listener's own Adult ego state."
