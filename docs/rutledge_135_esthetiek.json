    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating a 'cinematic' experience, particularly in the reconstruction of the biblical setting. Rutledge uses sensory details to bridge the gap between the ancient world and the hearer. The description of the 'bucolic but certainly off-track' riverbank and the 'scrub' provides a concrete visual contrast to the expected 'grand beginning.' She effectively employs color (purple dye) as a socio-economic marker, making Lydia’s status tangible. However, the imagery is largely historical-reconstructive rather than metaphorically innovative. It follows Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' by painting the scene of the minyan-less riverbank, allowing the hearer to feel the 'inauspicious' nature of the start of the European mission.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Rutledge demonstrates high stewardship of language, consistent with McEntyre’s criteria. Her word choice is precise—using terms like 'minyan,' 'God-fearers,' and 'bucolic' with clarity and purpose. She avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by explaining theological or historical terms within the flow of the narrative. The language is sophisticated yet accessible, doing justice to the complexity of Paul’s character without falling into clichés. There is a clear 'loving care' for the text, where every historical detail serves the larger purpose of reframing the hearer's perception of Paul and Lydia.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Christian gospel would have rapidly deteriorated into generic morality and spiritual slush.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a steady, teacherly cadence. It uses rhetorical parallelism effectively, particularly in the section describing Paul’s hardships. However, it occasionally leans toward 'paper language' due to its heavy reliance on historical data and long explanatory clauses. While the rhythm is dignified, it lacks the poetic staccato or lyrical 'flow' found in more aesthetically driven homiletics. The musicality is most present in the repetition of 'The strength of the Spirit...' toward the conclusion, which provides a liturgical crescendo. Overall, it is more oratorical than poetic.",
      "quotes": [

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high level of linguistic stewardship. Rutledge avoids the 'spiritual slush' she warns against by using precise, historically grounded language. The imagery is effective in 'painting the scene' of the early church, successfully applying the 'show, don't tell' principle in its narrative arcs. While the musicality is more functional than poetic, the clarity and lack of religious jargon create a sober beauty. The language is 'loving' in its attention to detail, honoring both the biblical characters and the intelligence of the congregation."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by upsetting the equilibrium—challenging the 'misapprehension' that Paul hated women. This creates a cognitive itch that the rest of the sermon seeks to scratch. The journey from Asia Minor to Europe serves as a physical and spiritual movement. The turning point occurs at the riverbank: the 'heroic' Paul meeting a 'handful of women.' This irony drives the narrative forward. The conclusion ties the historical narrative to the current congregation's building plans, though this 'landing' feels slightly more conventional than the journey itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "One of the most well known of these misapprehensions is the widely held view that he did not like women.",
        "This was definitely not a grand beginning for a new mission.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong example of Cilliers' 'reframing.' Rutledge takes the 'old' story of Lydia and frames it within the context of modern 'executive women' and the then-current Kosovo crisis. She respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the minyan, the purple dye) while making it startlingly relevant. The integration is organic; she doesn't use the text as a springboard but allows the text to speak into the context of a 'small congregation' facing 'new building plans.' She successfully reframes the 'heroic' mission of the church as something that often begins in 'off-track' spots.",
      "quotes": [
        "Macedonia, as we all now realize with new force... during the terrible events in Kosovo last year.",
        "Executive women are like this — imperious, fearless, born leaders.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The Kosovo reference, while powerful, could have been used to explore the 'refugee' nature of the gospel further.",
        "The 'building plans' application is a bit 'safe' compared to the radical nature of the biblical story.",
        "Could explore the 'strangeness' of the Holy Spirit's 'prevention' more deeply for a modern audience."

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Based on Stark’s 'open work of art,' the sermon is somewhat mixed. It is polyvalent in its characterization of Lydia and Paul, allowing for complexity (e.g., Paul's anxiety, Lydia's potential overbearing nature). However, the conclusion leans toward a more 'closed' moral and liturgical ending. The use of a long scripture quote (Philippians 1) to close the sermon is beautiful but acts as a 'seal' rather than an 'opening.' It invites the hearer into a tradition, but perhaps leaves less room for the 'ambivalence of existence' than the earlier sections of the sermon suggested.",
      "quotes": [
        "How often we have our hopes set on one direction, only to discover that God has something else in store for us!",
        "Maybe they are somewhat overbearing.",
        "And I am sure that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the 'extraordinary hardships' and 'anxiety' of Paul, avoiding kitsch.",
        "Leaves room for Lydia to be a complex, 'imperious' figure.",
        "The 'prevention by the Spirit' section opens space for the hearer's own disappointments."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The ending is very 'neat' and traditionally liturgical.",
        "Could leave more 'unanswered questions' regarding the Spirit's 'prevention' of Paul.",
        "The application to the building project is quite prescriptive."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily a 'closed' work of art that aims for a specific liturgical and communal resolution."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon is dramaturgically sound, moving from a historical 'problem' to a communal 'promise.' The integration of text and context is the sermon's greatest structural strength, particularly the 'reframing' of Macedonia through the lens of the Kosovo war. While the narrative arc is engaging, the conclusion follows a traditional homiletical pattern that closes the 'openness' of the text in favor of a clear, encouraging application for the local congregation. It is a well-constructed 'journey' that lands safely in the familiar territory of the parish's life."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. Rutledge explicitly warns against 'spiritual slush' and 'generic morality.' She avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by highlighting Paul’s 'toil and hardship' and his eventual execution in Rome. Lydia is not presented as a saintly caricature but as a 'mover and shaker' who might be 'overbearing.' By grounding the sermon in historical reality and the 'terrible events in Kosovo,' Rutledge ensures that the comfort offered is authentic rather than sentimental. The 'space for grace' is earned through an acknowledgment of the 'price that was paid.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential for the 'building plans' section to become 'God wants us to have a nice new hall' (largely avoided).",
      "The slight sentimentality in the All Saints Day hymn quote."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The raw list of Paul's sufferings from 2 Corinthians.",
      "The acknowledgment that the mission began 'off in the scrub' with no 'powerful people.'"

    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'sober' approach; ensure that the local application (building plans) remains as 'theologically gritty' as the biblical exposition."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by emphasizing that the 'power comes not from men but from God.' Rutledge uses the 'inauspicious' start of the European mission to show that grace operates outside human strategic planning. The concept of the Spirit 'preventing' Paul opens a space for the mystery of God's providence. However, the space is slightly narrowed by the very specific application to the church's building project, which moves from 'mystery' to 'management.' Nevertheless, the focus remains on God as the 'Divine Actor' (Immink).",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between Paul's 'heroic scale' and his 'anxiety' and 'shipwrecks' are well sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the Spirit's 'no' to Paul is highlighted as a point of reflection.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails, though a minor moralizing tone appears in the 'we must all play our part' section.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'open ending' of the Spirit's movement to linger longer before moving to the 'completion' of the building project."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of 'Sober-Reformed' aesthetics combined with the 'New Homiletic' focus on narrative. Rutledge avoids the 'aestheticism' of flowery language in favor of a 'stewardship of words' that is both intellectually rigorous and narratively compelling. The aesthetic power lies in the 'reframing' of the biblical narrative—making the ancient port of Neapolis and the riverbank of Philippi feel as immediate as a news report from Kosovo or a modern business meeting. The sermon successfully avoids religious kitsch by refusing to smooth over the 'toil and hardship' of the apostolic life. While the structure is somewhat traditional and the conclusion 'closes' the work more than a 'polyvalent' aesthetic might suggest, the overall effect is one of 'sober beauty' and theological depth. It creates a 'space for grace' by showing that the gospel often enters the world through the 'off-track' and the 'unnoticed,' rather than through the 'powerful.'",

      "Use the 'musicality' of silence or shorter, more rhythmic sentences in the climax."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Rutledge delivers a sermon that is aesthetically 'honest.' By rejecting 'spiritual slush,' she allows the 'sober beauty' of the gospel's difficult beginnings to shine. The sermon is a model of how to use historical precision as an aesthetic tool to 'reframe' reality for a modern audience. It is a 7/10—a high-quality, effective piece of homiletic craft that respects both the Word and the hearer."
