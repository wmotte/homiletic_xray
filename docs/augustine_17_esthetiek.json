    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes effective, though somewhat traditional, imagery to bridge the gap between abstract justice and concrete reality. The preacher employs the metaphor of the 'vessel' for the clergy and the 'sanctuary' for faith. The most striking imagery appears in §8, where the preacher contrasts the 'shabby home' with the 'rotten soul,' and the 'stench' of internal evil against external wealth. While it lacks the modern 'cinematic' detail of Wilson’s 'show don't tell' in a narrative sense, it uses rhetorical antithesis to create mental pictures of the internal state. The imagery of 'slipping feet' from the Psalm is used to ground the psychological experience of doubt. It is 'sober beauty' rather than baroque decoration.",
      "quotes": [
        "we’re like vessels consecrated to his service: we receive according to our capacity",
        "You suffer because your home looks shabby, and you assume they don’t suffer because their soul is rotten?",

        "Increase sensory detail regarding the 'holocausts' or 'streams of oil' to make the ancient sacrifice more visceral.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise, reflecting McEntyre’s 'stewardship of language.' The preacher meticulously defines terms, such as the distinction between 'judgment' and 'right judgment' (§2). There is a clear effort to avoid 'Canaanite jargon' by breaking down theological concepts like 'justice' into relational categories (self vs. neighbor). The word choice is economical; every sentence serves the progression of the argument. The distinction between 'suffering evil' and 'being evil' is a masterpiece of linguistic precision that prevents the hearer from falling into vague sentimentality. The tone is authoritative yet humble, avoiding the 'obscuring' nature of overly complex dogmatics.",
      "quotes": [
        "judgment in regard to yourself, and justice in regard to your neighbor.",
        "If it’s right, it’s a judgment pure and simple; if not, it’s a crime.",

        "Some repetitions of 'I’ve already said' could be streamlined.",
        "The ending feels slightly abrupt in its linguistic precision."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Theological terms like 'holocaust' and 'expiate' are used in their biblical context but immediately translated into the 'self' as sacrifice."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a strong rhythmic cadence, typical of the North African rhetorical style. It uses 'staccato' questions to create urgency and 'legato' explanations for reflection. The use of parallelism ('joy for those who blaspheme... blows for me who adore') creates a musical tension that mirrors the psalmist’s distress. The rhythm is designed for the ear, not the eye; the frequent use of 'Listen' and 'Tell me' punctuates the text, maintaining a conversational flow. The antithetical structures create a natural 'beat' that aids memorability and keeps the hearer engaged in the 'event' of the preaching.",
      "quotes": [
        "Does God know? Does he care?",
        "joy for those who blaspheme the Lord, and blows for me who adore him!",
        "being immortal, become good amid all those perishable goods."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The middle section (§5-6) becomes slightly more discursive and loses some rhythmic drive.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The sermon demonstrates a high level of micro-aesthetic quality. It avoids the 'kitsch' of flowery language in favor of a 'sober beauty' that relies on rhetorical precision and rhythmic antithesis. The imagery is not merely decorative but serves as a 'lens' (Cilliers) to reframe the hearer's perception of their own soul. The stewardship of language is evident in the careful definitions, ensuring that the 'Word' is not lost in vague abstraction but hits the 'core' of human experience."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with an 'upsetting of equilibrium' by asking what is worthy of God. It then moves into the 'conflict' of theodicy—the prosperity of the wicked vs. the suffering of the good. The 'turning point' is the entry into the 'sanctuary' (§7), shifting the perspective from the 'now' to the 'end.' There is a palpable movement from the external (sacrifices) to the internal (the heart). However, the arc is somewhat interrupted by the promise to continue the topic 'some other day,' which leaves the narrative energy slightly dissipated at the very end.",
      "quotes": [
        "What shall I offer the Lord which is worthy of him?",
        "This shaken man began to wonder, “Does God really know about this?”",
        "Till I entered the sanctuary of God and began to understand those people’s end."

      "strengths": [
        "Clear movement from a problem (theodicy) to a resolution (faith/sanctuary).",
        "Effective use of the 'shaken man' as a surrogate for the hearer's own doubt.",
        "Strong opening that establishes a 'stake' for the listener."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition to the 'second day' (§8) feels like a structural 'leak' in tension.",
        "The 'climax' in the sanctuary could be more dramatically heightened.",
        "The connection between the Micah 6 and Psalm 73 sections could be more tightly woven into a single arc."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey from external ritual to internal sanctuary, though slightly open-ended."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels at 'reframing' (Cilliers). It takes the ancient texts of Micah and the Psalms and applies them directly to the universal human experience of envy and injustice. The 'context' is the human heart's tendency to blame God for misfortune. The preacher 'reframes' wealth not as a sign of favor, but as a tool for good, and 'reframes' suffering not as a sign of abandonment, but as an external 'blow' that does not touch the 'good' soul. The synthesis is organic; the biblical 'strangeness' of animal sacrifice is immediately translated into the 'offering of the self,' making the text an operative reality for the congregation.",
      "quotes": [
        "You asked what you could offer. Offer your very self.",
        "Is it for nothing that I’ve kept my heart clean... while I cringe under the blows of misfortune?",
        "Wealth is good... but only to do good with."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Surprising yet natural connection between 'sacrificial ritual' and 'self-judgment'.",
        "Honors the 'strangeness' of the text while making it accessible.",
        "Provides a new 'frame' for viewing the prosperity of others."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could include more specific 'contextual' examples of the 'wealthy' in the local community.",
        "The 'reframing' of the 'end' could be more vividly contrasted with the 'now'.",
        "More explicit connection to the liturgical 'event' of the gathering."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strongly present; reality is reframed through the lens of the 'sanctuary of faith'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "As an 'open work of art' (Stark), the sermon is a mixed success. On one hand, it invites the hearer into the 'sanctuary' and acknowledges the 'vast and difficult undertaking' of understanding God’s justice, leaving room for mystery. On the other hand, the preacher’s authority is very present ('I’ll tell you'), and the definitions of 'judgment' are quite prescriptive. The ending is 'open' in a literal sense—it stops before finishing the topic—but the theological conclusions are relatively 'sealed.' It treats the hearer as a 'pious soul' capable of faith, but guides them quite firmly toward a specific interpretation of their suffering.",
      "quotes": [
        "Maybe I’ll manage to explain how … But no! Instead, learn—together with me—from him who teaches me.",
        "what’s hidden today will be unveiled tomorrow.",
        "we’ll treat of these matters with you some other day."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the limits of the human mind ('something here you just can’t comprehend').",
        "The 'open ending' leaves the hearer waiting for more.",
        "Invites the hearer to 'enter the sanctuary' themselves."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'I'll tell you' approach can feel slightly coercive rather than invitational.",
        "Could leave more 'unanswered' questions regarding the specific pain of the listeners.",
        "The moral categories (good vs. evil) are presented as very binary/closed."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Polyvalent in its acknowledgement of mystery, but monovalent in its rhetorical delivery."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is characterized by a strong narrative movement from the 'problem' of theodicy to the 'solution' found in the sanctuary of faith. It effectively 'reframes' the hearer's reality, moving them from external observation to internal introspection. While the sermon is rhetorically authoritative, it maintains a degree of 'openness' by acknowledging the mystery of God's timing. The 'plot' is dynamic, though the conclusion is more of a 'pause' than a final resolution, which fits the 'event' of a multi-day teaching series."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'cheap comfort' and 'happy endings' that ignore the reality of pain. Instead, it sustains the tension of the 'shaken man' who 'cringes under the blows of misfortune.' The preacher does not offer an immediate material solution to suffering but insists on the 'difficulty' of the undertaking. There is no 'sentimentality' here; the emotion is authentic, grounded in the 'perilous situation' of losing one's soul to envy. It is a 'sober' aesthetic that takes the 'stench' of the soul and the 'blows' of life seriously.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None identified; the sermon avoids clichéd 'God has a plan' tropes in favor of 'mystery' and 'judgment'.",
      "Avoids the 'happy ending' by deferring ultimate resolution to 'tomorrow' (the eschaton)."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission of the psalmist: 'As for me, I lost my balance; my feet almost slipped.'",
      "The stark contrast: 'You suffer because your home looks shabby... they suffer because their soul is rotten?'"
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of 'aesthetic honesty' by continuing to resist the urge to resolve the 'why' of suffering too quickly."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by moving the focus away from human 'offering' (holocausts, oil) to God's 'requirement' which is ultimately a transformation of the self. By entering the 'sanctuary,' the preacher creates a 'space' where the 'Holy happens' (Immink) beyond human comprehension. However, the space is slightly narrowed by the strong emphasis on 'correcting yourself' and 'exercising judgment,' which can lean toward moralism if not balanced by the 'help of him who created you.' The 'mystery' of God's justice is respected, but the 'task' of the hearer is very clearly defined.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'happy wicked' and 'suffering good' is sustained until the eschatological 'end'.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, the preacher explicitly states there is 'something here you just can’t comprehend.'",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the 'sanctuary,' but moralization is present in the 'judgment of self' section.",
    "recommendation": "To create more space, emphasize the 'gift' of the sanctuary more than the 'effort' of entering it."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.3,
    "summary": "This sermon is a sophisticated example of 'Sober-Reformed' aesthetics (avant la lettre), characterized by rhetorical precision, psychological depth, and a refusal of kitsch. It functions as an 'event' (Immink) that invites the hearer into a process of 'reframing' (Cilliers) their internal life. The 'Poetics of Language' are strong, relying on antithesis and rhythm rather than flowery imagery. The 'Dramaturgy of Structure' effectively moves the listener from the 'problem' of external injustice to the 'sanctuary' of internal faith. While the preacher maintains a high degree of rhetorical authority, the acknowledgement of human limitation and the deferral of resolution to the 'end' creates a space for grace and mystery. The sermon's primary aesthetic power lies in its ability to translate ancient biblical categories into the 'theatre of the heart,' making the act of 'judging oneself' a vivid, necessary, and ultimately hopeful performance of faith.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional linguistic precision and definition of terms.",
      "Authentic handling of theodicy without resorting to religious kitsch.",
      "Strong rhythmic and oral quality that engages the listener."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The structural 'leak' at the end where the topic is deferred.",
      "The slightly prescriptive/authoritative tone that limits 'openness'.",
      "The need for more vivid, contemporary sensory details in the imagery."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Rhetorical / Internal-Reframing",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Marilyn Chandler McEntyre (Stewardship of Language).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to hearers who value intellectual clarity, psychological honesty, and a 'no-nonsense' approach to faith.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Use the 'show don't tell' principle to illustrate the 'sanctuary' more vividly.",
      "Allow the 'open ending' to be a liturgical moment of silence rather than a verbal deferral.",
      "Balance the 'judgment of self' with more explicit 'images of grace'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Through the lens of homiletic aesthetics, this sermon is a robust '7.3'. It excels in the 'Poetics of Language' and 'Anti-Kitsch' depth, providing a clear, rhythmic, and honest exploration of the soul. It avoids the pitfalls of superficial beauty, opting instead for a 'transparent' style that points toward the mystery of God. While it could benefit from more 'openness' and sensory 'showing,' it remains a powerful example of how form and content can be inseparably connected to produce a 'happening' of the Word."
