    "sermon_start_end": "In cultures the world over, weddings are generally the biggest parties that families ever give. God loves parties. Did you know that? From one end to another, the Bible is full of imagery about parties. [...] No wonder St. Paul summons us (in today’s lesson) to “rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say rejoice!” (Philippians 4:4). “Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb” (Revelation 19:9). Amen.",
    "notes": "The sermon was delivered at St. John’s Church, Salisbury, CT, by a preacher with a clear Episcopalian context."

  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a solid exegetical framework, correctly identifying the parable's Middle Eastern cultural context regarding hospitality. The 'Sache' (the living Christ) is presented through the lens of the 'Marriage Supper of the Lamb.' However, the theological depth remains somewhat horizontal. While Calvin is cited to explain the 'wedding garment' as a gift from God, the sermon spends significant time on sociological observations (Episcopalian vs. Pentecostal vs. Jewish cultures) which, while engaging, occasionally dilute the dogmatic 'blue' weight of the text. The transition from the 'royal wedding' to the 'eschatological banquet' is clear but lacks a rigorous Barthian exploration of the 'Wholly Other' nature of God's judgment.",
      "quotes": [
        "Hospitality in the ancient Near East... is a major cultural preoccupation.",
        "Whomsoever the Lord invites he also supplies with clothing.",
        "The invitation was sheer grace."

        "Reduce the length of sociological anecdotes to allow for more exegetical 'meat'."

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The language is accessible and the metaphors are relatable to a New England congregation."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher displays a high degree of transparency, particularly through the 'Siberia' anecdote at the Metropolitan Opera. This is a conscious 'Selbstenthüllung' used to illustrate human pride. There is a palpable sense of the preacher's own struggle with social class and 'Episcopalian' reserve. The 'green' side is generally diaconal—serving the message of human foolishness—rather than ego-driven. However, there is a slight 'hysterical' tendency in the sense of using personal social narratives as the primary vehicle for the Gospel, which risks making the preacher's experience the primary locus of revelation.",
      "quotes": [
        "I am ashamed to tell you that I was utterly chagrined.",
        "I tell this little story to illustrate the theme... the fellowship of human foolishness.",
        "It’s a little difficult for us Episcopalians to get on board with this feasting business."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive/Hysterical mix. The preacher seeks harmony and 'closeness' through shared vulnerability (Depressive) but uses theatrical, personal anecdotes to maintain engagement (Hysterical).",
      "diaconal_quality": "High. The 'I' is used to bridge the gap between the ancient text and the modern listener's pride.",
      "strengths": [

    },
    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'solidary.' The preacher places themselves in the same boat as the congregation ('fellowship of human foolishness'). There is a 'we-definition' that challenges the congregation's potential snobbery without being paternalistic. However, there is a subtle 'teaching' distance when discussing other cultures (Jewish/Black Pentecostal), which could be perceived as 'observational' rather than truly 'relational.' The tone is warm but carries the authority of a seasoned observer of human nature. The 'yellow' signal is: 'We are all slightly stuck-up, but God invites us anyway.'",
      "quotes": [
        "We are all members of the fellowship of human foolishness.",
        "Lest we too quickly look down our noses at the worldly rector’s wife...",
        "Our party won’t be a perfect party."

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon successfully navigates the tension between 'Zuspruch' (Promise) and 'Anspruch' (Demand). The 'red' side is not a moralistic 'do better,' but an invitation to 'put on Christ.' The preacher correctly identifies that the 'wedding garment' is a gift, not a self-made achievement. The appeal is to 'joy' and 'hope' rather than 'duty.' However, the 'demand' to care for the 'rat-infested tenements' is a sharp, necessary disruption. The ratio is well-balanced: the demand for social justice is rooted in the gift of the invitation.",
      "quotes": [
        "The problem is our unwillingness to put on the garment that God gives us.",
        "It means taking a new interest in God’s children... in the rat-infested tenements of the Bronx.",
        "Do not be fooled by the stern language... it is your own personal invitation to joy."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The promise (the party is ready) precedes and enables the demand (put on the garment).",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Low. The preacher emphasizes that the garment is supplied by the Lord.",
      "strengths": [
        "Theologically sound interpretation of the 'wedding garment' as grace.",
        "Concrete application of the 'appeal' to local and global contexts."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'how-to' of 'putting on Christ' could be more existentially specific.",
        "The transition from the 'opera' to 'the Bronx' is slightly abrupt."

    "dominant_side": "Green (Self-revelation) and Red (Appeal).",
    "disruptions": "A slight 'noise' occurs when the preacher discusses 'black Episcopalians' and 'Jewish weddings'—it risks turning the congregation into 'observers' of sociology rather than 'participants' in the Kingdom.",
    "healing_disruption": "The mention of the 'wrong side of the railroad tracks in Canaan' serves as a prophetic disruption to the comfortable Salisbury audience."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This is a strong, communicatively competent sermon that excels in the 'Green' (Self-revelation) and 'Red' (Appeal) dimensions. The preacher uses personal narrative effectively to dismantle the 'Yellow' (Relational) barriers of social pride. Theologically, it follows a Barthian/Reformed trajectory by emphasizing that the 'wedding garment' is a gift of grace (Zuspruch) rather than a human work. However, the sermon occasionally leans too heavily on sociological and class-based anecdotes, which can border on 'psychologization' of the Gospel. While the 'party' metaphor is biblically grounded, the sermon risks making the 'Kingdom' feel like a better version of a New York social event rather than the radical 'Other' of God's reign. The 'healing disruption' regarding social justice is well-placed but could be more deeply integrated into the Christological center.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a risk of 'domesticating' the eschatological banquet by comparing it too closely to human parties. God remains the 'Acting Subject,' but the heavy use of human experience (opera, weddings) occasionally threatens to make God an object of our social analysis.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Excellent use of vulnerability to address the sin of pride.",
      "Theologically accurate handling of Law and Gospel (Garment as Grace).",
      "Strong, evocative imagery that connects with the specific congregation."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce the reliance on 'class-based' anecdotes to reach a broader 'ear'.",
      "Strengthen the 'Blue' side by exploring the 'judgment' aspect of the parable more deeply.",
      "Ensure the 'I' remains strictly diaconal and doesn't become the main attraction."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A highly effective, congruent sermon that successfully translates a difficult parable into a contemporary context without losing the core message of grace."
