    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes strong, contrasting imagery to bridge the gap between abstract judgment and concrete mercy. The preacher effectively employs the 'Four Pages' principle by Paul Scott Wilson, moving from the 'arctic dismissal' of being spewed out to the domestic warmth of a door and a meal. The imagery of the 'bottomless abyss' for the thief on the cross provides a cinematic quality. However, some images remain within the realm of traditional homiletical tropes (the 'solid rock', 'crooked ways straight') which, while effective for the tradition, border on the 'dead metaphors' Cilliers warns against. The strength lies in the 'optics' of the door—the physical act of knocking and the child’s perspective of 'living in the back of the house'—which makes the theological concept of resistance visible and spatial.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is a blend of high-register academic vocabulary ('non sequitur', 'exigencies', 'vicissitudes') and colloquial, direct address. This creates a 'polyphony' as described by Ciska Stark, appealing to different layers of the congregation. However, there is a certain 'sloppiness' in the aggressive dismissal of opponents ('idiots', 'dumbbells', 'fools') which, while rhetorically powerful in a performance context, lacks the 'stewardship of language' McEntyre advocates for. The preacher is precise when discussing the tension between judgment and mercy, but less so when drifting into political asides. The use of 'Canaanite' language is present but usually contextualized through personal testimony.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest micro-aesthetic feature. The text exhibits a clear 'cadence' and 'flow' characteristic of Gerrit Immink’s 'performance' theory. The use of anaphora ('He will...', 'Let him in!') creates a percussive, rhythmic drive toward the conclusion. The variation in sentence length—moving from complex theological sentences to staccato exclamations—functions as a musical score. The preacher uses 'rhetorical figures' like parallelism and repetition to ensure the message 'sticks' to the ear. It is clearly 'oral language' rather than 'paper language', designed for the breath and the pulse of a live congregation.",

The preacher uses language as a performative instrument, blending sophisticated vocabulary with the rhythmic patterns of the Black Church tradition. While the imagery is effective and often cinematic, it occasionally relies on traditional tropes. The primary strength is the 'stewardship of the ear'—the sermon is composed for sound, using repetition and cadence to create an emotional and spiritual atmosphere that facilitates the 'event' of the Word."

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry) by starting with a 'collision' or 'non sequitur' in the text. This 'upsetting of the equilibrium' immediately engages the hearer’s curiosity. The movement proceeds from the 'shock' of judgment to the 'invitation' of the door. The preacher uses 'reframing' (Cilliers) to move the hearer from a passive observer of a biblical text to a person standing behind a closed door. The 'turning point' is the shift from 'who is knocking' to 'the door itself'. The conclusion provides a strong emotional resolution through the 'good night vs. goodbye' narrative, though the political asides slightly derail the momentum.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The integration of the Laodicean context with the 1970s American context is achieved through the theme of 'materialism' and 'reality'. The preacher 'reframes' the biblical 'lukewarmness' as a modern 'spiritual bankruptcy' despite corporate success. However, the connection sometimes feels 'pasted on' when discussing specific political figures (the Secretary of Treasury, the President). The 'strangeness' of the Revelation text is acknowledged initially but quickly domesticated into a more general 'call to decision'. The synthesis is effective for the moment but lacks the deep, enduring 'reframing' that Cilliers advocates for in more complex aesthetic works.",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "In terms of Ciska Stark’s 'Open Work of Art', this sermon is relatively 'closed'. It is a 'monovalent' call to decision. While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence' of the preacher’s own life (shame and pride), the theological conclusion is prescriptive: 'Let him in!'. The use of the 'last knock' creates a sense of urgency that, while homiletically traditional, 'seals the work' by forcing a binary choice. There is little room for the 'mystery' or 'polyphony' of interpretation; the preacher acts as the authoritative witness. The 'good night vs. goodbye' story is a classic 'closed' narrative that leaves the hearer with a moral ultimatum rather than an open-ended invitation to wonder.",
      "quotes": [
        "God is not in control of your decision... You control that!",
        "If you finish as you are now, I'll never see you.",

      "strengths": [
        "The preacher’s honesty about his own 'shame' opens a small space for the hearer’s own struggle.",

    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is built on a solid narrative arc that effectively uses tension and release. The preacher successfully 'reframes' the biblical text into a contemporary existential crisis. However, the structure is heavily 'closed', aimed at a specific emotional and volitional climax. While this is effective for 'persuasion' (rhetoric), it limits the 'aesthetic openness' (Stark). The dramaturgy is that of a 'witness' (Long) leading the jury to a verdict, rather than a poet inviting the hearer into a landscape of grace."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 5,
    "analysis": "The sermon teeters on the edge of 'religious kitsch' as defined by Cilliers. The 'good night vs. goodbye' story at the deathbed is a classic sentimental trope that risks 'pre-chewed emotions'. However, the preacher saves it from pure kitsch by his own 'authentic' admission of carrying shame to his death and his visceral critique of materialism. The 'kitsch' elements are the 'happy ending' promises ('put food on your table', 'sunshine every day'), which offer immediate comfort without fully sustaining the 'pain of suffering' mentioned in the Laodicean context. It is a battle between 'sentiment' (the dying mother) and 'emotion' (the preacher's own 40-year struggle).",

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is 'opened' by the preacher's vulnerability and the vivid portrayal of Christ's persistent knocking. However, space is 'closed' by the heavy emphasis on human 'control' over salvation ('God is not in control of your decision'). This 'Arminian' aesthetic shifts the focus from the 'unavailable grace' of God to the 'task' of the human will. The 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) is somewhat constricted by the moralizing 'last knock' warning, which replaces 'wonder' with 'urgency'. Yet, the final 'Good night' motif successfully opens a space for 'hope' beyond death, respecting the 'mystery' of the 'healthy shore'.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between judgment and mercy is sustained well in the first half but resolved somewhat cheaply in the 'Let him in' sequence.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the 'afterlife' is respected through poetic language, but the 'process' of salvation is over-explained as a human decision.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the 'invitation' imagery, but moralization (the 'ought') and volitional pressure ('you must') are strong competitors.",
    "recommendation": "Shift the focus from the 'human hand on the latch' to the 'divine hand on the door' to allow grace to be more 'gratuitous' and less 'transactional'."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the 'Narrative-Dramatic' style, deeply rooted in the performance traditions of the Black Church. Its primary aesthetic power lies in its 'musicality' and 'dramaturgy'—it is a 'happening' (Immink) that moves the hearer through a carefully constructed arc of tension. The language is 'stewardly' in its precision and rhythmic beauty, though it occasionally descends into 'kitsch' through sentimental deathbed narratives and 'prosperity' clichés. The preacher successfully 'reframes' the biblical text, making the 'lukewarm' condition of Laodicea a mirror for the 'spiritual bankruptcy' of modern corporate life. While the sermon is 'closed' in its monovalent call to decision, its 'sober beauty' and the preacher's own vulnerability provide moments of authentic aesthetic depth. It is a sermon that 'shows' the door of the soul with such clarity that the hearer cannot help but hear the 'knock'.",

      "Rhythmic and musical language that creates a powerful 'oral event'.",
      "Strong narrative arc that utilizes textual tension to create existential urgency.",

    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Gerrit Immink (Performance/Event) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Four Pages).",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who value emotional resonance, rhythmic preaching, and clear existential calls to action; particularly those within the African American homiletical tradition or 'High-Church' evangelicalism.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' (Stark) to see how the congregation handles the 'ambivalence' of grace.",
      "Deepen the 'reframing' of the 'supping' metaphor—what does it mean to 'eat' with the Holy in a world of 'hogs at the trough'?",
      "Read the manuscript aloud to identify where 'harsh' language (like 'idiots') breaks the 'musicality' of the grace-centered sections."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Through the lens of homiletic aesthetics, this sermon is a 'strong' (7/10) performance that successfully transforms a biblical text into a contemporary 'event'. It excels in 'musicality' and 'imagery', creating a 'space' where the hearer is confronted by the 'Holy'. Its flaws lie in its 'closed' structure and occasional 'kitsch', which treat the hearer more as a 'target of persuasion' than a 'partner in the open work of art'. Nevertheless, the preacher's 'stewardship of language' and his ability to 'paint the picture' of the soul's door make this a compelling example of the aesthetic turn in practice."
