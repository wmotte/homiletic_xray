  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a solid exegetical framework by connecting the narrative of Acts 11 with the broader biblical trajectory of inclusion (Galatians 3:28, Revelation 21). The 'Sache' is the breaking of boundaries by the Holy Spirit. However, the theological depth is somewhat flattened by a heavy focus on the sociological/familial metaphor. While the 'blue' side correctly identifies the shift from Law to Gospel in Peter’s vision, it treats the theological reality of 'cleanness' primarily as a psychological hurdle of 'unlearning' rather than a radical ontological shift in Christ. The Barthian 'Living Christ' is present but often mediated through the lens of human tradition and family dynamics, making the factual content more about human development than divine act.",
      "quotes": [
        "These you shall regard as detestable among the birds...",
        "The Lectionary committee pays no attention to Mother’s Day...",

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The language is accessible and the logic of 'moving beyond family rules' is easily grasped by a lay audience."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as a bridge-builder, attempting to honor tradition (Mother's Day) while simultaneously subverting it. There is a controlled 'Selbstdarstellung' of a progressive teacher who is comfortable with 'newness.' However, there is little 'Selbstenthüllung' regarding the preacher's own struggle with unlearning. The 'I' remains largely hidden behind a collective 'we' or a descriptive 'Peter.' The green side suggests a person who values intellectual and social progress but maintains a professional distance from the existential pain of the 'crisis' described.",
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive-Compulsive mix. The preacher seeks harmony ('precious hint') and avoids sharp confrontation with the congregation, yet maintains a very structured, orderly progression of thought (Compulsive) to ensure the 'newness' doesn't lead to chaos.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is subservient to the pedagogical goal, but perhaps too much so; the lack of personal vulnerability makes the call to 'unlearn' feel slightly academic.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher to Student' or 'Guide to Traveler.' The preacher uses 'we' and 'us' frequently to create a sense of solidarity ('most of us who grew up in good families'). However, there is a subtle paternalism in the way the preacher assumes the congregation's limitations (e.g., 'kids pick up the secret message'). The yellow side signals a safe, pastoral environment where the hearer is invited to grow, but the authority remains firmly in the pulpit as the one who defines what is 'too small' or 'fearful' in the listeners' upbringing.",
      "quotes": [
        "I suggest that this man Peter is very much like most of us...",
        "We teach our children the passions and commitments of our family...",
        "Our life in the church would be greatly different if Peter had resisted."

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The appeal is the dominant side. The sermon moves toward a clear demand: 'unlearn' and 'love everyone.' While the preacher attempts to ground this in the 'Zuspruch' of God's new world (Rev 21), the sermon often lands as a moral imperative. The Gospel (Zuspruch) is presented as the *reason* for the demand, but the weight of the sermon is on the human action of unlearning and expanding horizons. There is a risk of 'moralism' where the Gospel becomes a new, albeit more inclusive, Law.",
      "quotes": [
        "We must unlearn some of what they taught us...",
        "The accent is on what is new. This is a new commandment...",
        "And our part is a new commandment."

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The balance tips toward 'Anspruch' (Demand). The 'Gift' of the Spirit is mentioned, but the 'Task' of unlearning dominates the rhetoric.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Moderate. The sermon risks making 'inclusivity' the new legalism.",
      "strengths": [
        "Clear, actionable direction.",
        "Strong eschatological motivation (Rev 21)."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Emphasize that the 'unlearning' is a fruit of the Spirit, not a work of the will.",

    "dominant_side": "Red (Appeal)",
    "disruptions": "The primary disruption is the 'Mother's Day' tension. The preacher uses the holiday to create a point of contact, but then immediately pivots to 'unlearning' what mothers teach, which may create cognitive dissonance for the listener.",
    "healing_disruption": "Yes. The disruption of the 'family-idolatry' often found in churches is a 'healing disruption' that serves the truth of the Gospel's universality."

    "the_factual_ear_hears": "Peter had a vision that changed church history from a Jewish sect to a global movement.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6,
    "summary": "This sermon is a competent example of 'Liberal-Homiletical' tradition, focusing on the transformative power of the Gospel to break social and familial boundaries. Theologically, it follows a Barthian impulse by emphasizing God as the one who 'makes all things new,' yet it leans heavily into the psychological process of 'unlearning.' The preacher successfully navigates the 'Mother's Day' trap by using it as a foil for the radicality of the Gospel, though this risks alienating the 'Relational Ear' of those seeking simple affirmation. The 'Red' side (Appeal) is strong, perhaps too strong, as the Gospel is framed as a 'new commandment' (Anspruch) more than a 'finished work' (Zuspruch). The 'Green' side lacks the vulnerability required to make the 'unlearning' feel like a shared existential journey rather than a lecture.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a significant risk of psychologizing the Revelation. The 'dream' is described as something 'we would call a dream' or 'fantasy,' potentially reducing the Holy Spirit's intervention to a subconscious shift in Peter's perspective.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Excellent use of the 'Mother's Day' tension to illustrate a theological point.",
      "Clear, logical progression from the specific (Peter) to the universal (The Church).",
      "Strong integration of multiple biblical texts."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Increase personal congruence by sharing the preacher's own 'unlearning'.",
      "Shift the focus from the human 'unlearning' to the divine 'enabling'.",
      "Soften the pedagogical tone to allow the 'Yellow' side to feel more solidary."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A solid, satisfactory sermon that effectively communicates a difficult truth, but lacks the exceptional depth or personal vulnerability to move beyond a score of 6."
