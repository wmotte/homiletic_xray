    "summary": "The service is a classic example of high-liturgical Parent-Child communication. While it provides significant aesthetic beauty (Free Child) and emotional containment (Nurturing Parent), it lacks Adult engagement. It reinforces a 'Victim' identity for the congregation, suggesting they are helpless 'clay' or 'prisoners' without external intervention. However, because it is a communal ritual rather than a personality-driven sermon, the risk of individual psychological abuse is lower; the 'game' is systemic rather than personal.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult address leaves no room for the listener's agency.",
      "Heavy emphasis on 'disobedience' and 'weakness' can foster a shame-based identity."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Include a moment of 'Adult' reflection—perhaps a brief homily that asks the congregation to consider how they, in the here-and-now, can practically 'amend their lives' using their own reason and resources, rather than relying solely on the passive role of being 'rescued'."
