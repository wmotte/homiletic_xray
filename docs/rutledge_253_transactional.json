While it employs the Critical Parent to deconstruct shallow cultural theology, it avoids becoming a 'Game' by being transparent about its theological goals. It moves from a position of 'I'm OK, You're Not OK' (regarding New Age views) to a shared 'We are all in the fiery furnace' position, ultimately pointing to Christ as the autonomous 'Yes.'",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The shift to political critique (Social Services) feels like a sudden Parent-to-Child 'finger-wag' that may trigger defensiveness.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To further minimize games, the preacher could invite the congregation's Adult to explore the political implications together rather than 'handing down' the judgment from the Critical Parent position."
