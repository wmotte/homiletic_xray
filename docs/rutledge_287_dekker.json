    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on one specific passage. It treats the Babylonian exile as a general theme, jumping from 2 Chronicles to Jeremiah, then to Ezekiel, and finally to Second Isaiah. It lacks the 'NOWHERE else' specificity Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "A brief account of the disaster is given in today’s first reading from the Second Book of Chronicles.",
        "The prophet Ezekiel was one of these...",

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates historical knowledge of the 587 BC crisis and the 'theological emergency' it created. However, the exegesis is more descriptive of the history than an analytical exposition of the Hebrew text's nuances.",
      "quotes": [
        "The invasion, conquest, and exile of 587 was the greatest crisis in the history of the people.",
        "The setting for the Babylonian invasion was one of heedless optimism, self-satisfaction."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is strong and concrete. The comparison between Jerusalem and Salisbury, and the 'gods of Las Vegas,' effectively bridges the gap to the modern zeitgeist. It avoids generalities by naming specific local landmarks and cultural icons.",
      "quotes": [
        "Imagine that the Town Hall, the Ragamont Inn, the White Hart... are burned at once.",
        "I would lose my mind if I were dragged off against my will to spend the rest of my days in Las Vegas.",

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a somewhat linear path: modern analogy, then biblical history, then back to modern application. While the Salisbury analogy is used as a lens, the 'present of revelation' where text and hearer merge is interrupted by the broad survey of multiple Bible books.",
      "quotes": [
        "To return to our imaginary invasion of Salisbury by a foreign power...",
        "In the context of the exile in Babylon, however, Isaiah’s Servant signifies..."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Misery is well-articulated as the 'theological emergency' and the impotence of idols. Redemption is present through the 'Suffering Servant.' Gratitude is less prominent, though the ending touches on the comfort of being 'precious' to God.",
      "quotes": [
        "The real problem is that they cannot save. They have no power.",

      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon takes the 'two ways' seriously. It contrasts the 'heedless optimism' of the false prophets with the 'searing Word of God.' It explicitly mentions the danger of being 'lost in time' by serving gods that cannot save.",
      "quotes": [
        "The prophets prophesy lies … and my people love it this way.",
        "If you don’t repent and return to the Lord... you are going to have to serve false gods in earnest."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the 'telos' of the Suffering Servant passage, but the connection feels slightly external—imposed on the Old Testament text rather than arising from its specific witness to the 'One Lord'.",
      "quotes": [
        "No Christian can hear this without thinking of Jesus Christ.",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 1950 words, the sermon likely clocks in just under the 20-minute threshold (at 100 words/min). According to Dekker, it risks lacking the 'breadth' required for true depth.",

  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s formal definition by failing to center on one specific Bible passage, instead opting for a thematic survey of the Exile. It lacks the 'NOWHERE else' specificity. However, it excels in concrete application and takes the 'two ways' (the seriousness of idolatry) with a sobriety rarely found in modern preaching.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application: The Salisbury/Las Vegas analogy is a strong example of Dekker's requirement for cultural relevance.",
      "Seriousness of the Word: The sermon avoids 'cheap grace' by emphasizing the 'theological emergency' and the impotence of false gods."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of focus: By covering Chronicles, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Isaiah, it becomes a lecture on biblical history rather than a sermon on a text.",
      "Duration: It sits on the edge of the 20-minute minimum, sacrificing depth for a broad overview."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a strong theological speech with excellent application, but it is not yet a 'sermon' in Dekker's strict sense because it lacks a singular scriptural anchor. It is a thematic treatment of a biblical event rather than an exposition of a specific Word of God."
