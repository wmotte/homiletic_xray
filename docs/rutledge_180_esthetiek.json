    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes strong, relatable imagery to bridge the gap between abstract Trinitarian doctrine and human experience. The opening 'parable' of the desperate parent creates a visceral emotional landscape. Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' is evident in the description of the parent's sacrifices. However, the imagery becomes more conventional in the second half, relying on the biblical metaphor of the 'watchman' without adding significant fresh sensory detail. The strength lies in the translation of 'interrelatedness' into the concrete 'foolishness' of a parent’s love, which Cilliers would describe as an effective 'optics' for seeing the heart of God.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise, particularly in its critique of liturgical changes. The preacher exhibits 'stewardship of language' by reviving archaic terms like 'miserable offenders' and 'vast primordial catastrophe,' explaining their necessity rather than hiding behind them. There is a clear effort to avoid 'Canaanite jargon' by defining the Trinity through 'dynamic interrelatedness' and 'self-giving love.' The word choice is economical and deliberate, reflecting McEntyre’s call for clarity and truth-telling. The distinction between 'sentiment' and 'the fear of the Lord' is handled with theological nuance.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a dignified, liturgical rhythm, likely influenced by the Book of Common Prayer. There is a clear use of parallelism ('without restraint, without measure, without calculation'). However, the rhythm occasionally feels 'paper-heavy,' particularly in the middle sections where the preacher quotes commentators or prayer books. The cadence is more oratorical than conversational, which fits the 'Sober-Reformed/Anglican' aesthetic but lacks the staccato energy of truly oral performance. It listens like a well-crafted essay meant for the pulpit.",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' and high precision. It avoids superficiality by leaning into the weight of traditional liturgical language while translating it for a modern audience. The imagery is strongest when dealing with human relationships (parent/child) and weakest when relying on traditional biblical tropes. It is a 'witnessing' style of language—clear, authoritative, and respectful of the words' power to convey reality. While it lacks poetic 'fire,' it possesses a steady, rhythmic dignity that commands attention."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'Lowry Loop' to some extent, beginning with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' (the self-destructing child). It creates tension by describing Paul's 'agonized' state. However, the structure is divided into two distinct movements (Trinity and Psalm 130), which weakens the overall narrative arc of the piece as a single event. The movement from 'the depths' to 'the dawn' in the second part provides a classic dramaturgical progression, but the resolution feels somewhat predictable. It is more of a 'teaching journey' than a high-stakes dramatic performance.",
      "quotes": [
        "Imagine for a moment that you are the parent of a child... on the verge of self-destruction.",
        "Precisely at the point of that confession, the psalmist is enabled to raise up his eyes.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong point. The preacher 'reframes' the Trinity not as a mathematical puzzle but as a parental desperation—a brilliant move in the vein of Cilliers. The context of a 'culture of self-esteem' (implied by the removal of 'miserable offenders') is directly confronted by the text of Psalm 130. The sermon does not smooth over the 'strangeness' of the biblical text; instead, it argues that the strangeness (the 'fear' of God) is exactly what the modern context needs. It offers a new frame: that acknowledging 'no health in us' is the only path to true health.",

        "The church that was breaking his heart is the one that gets the full Trinitarian blessing.",

      "reframing_present": "Yes, it reframes the Trinity as 'self-giving love' and confession as 'the path of life'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward a 'closed' structure. While it is not moralistic in a 'do-this' sense, it is dogmatically firm. The preacher provides the answers and the interpretations clearly. There is little room for the hearer to struggle with the 'ambivalence of existence' because the preacher resolves the tension quickly with the 'plenteous redemption' of the Gospel. It is a 'witnessing' sermon that seeks to convince, which Stark might find slightly 'sealed shut.' The hearer is a recipient of a well-explained truth rather than a co-explorer of a mystery.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is no dry scholarly doctrine that we celebrate today.",
        "If we can only begin to understand what is meant here... we will understand the one thing we really need to know.",

    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is solid but traditional. It excels in the 'reframing' of difficult doctrines into human terms, creating a bridge between the ancient text and the modern pew. However, the structure is somewhat fragmented by the two-part nature of the text. The narrative arc starts with high emotional stakes but settles into a more didactic, instructional mode. It is a 'safe' structure that provides clear resolution, which may satisfy the need for comfort but lacks the 'openness' that invites deeper, more ambivalent reflection."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully avoids religious kitsch by refusing to offer 'cheap grace.' By insisting on the 'vast primordial catastrophe' and the 'miserable offender' status, the preacher bypasses the 'happy ending' cliché. The emotion in the opening (the parent) feels authentic because it acknowledges the 'neglect of health' and 'jeopardizing standing'—real costs, not just sentimental feelings. It distinguishes between a 'vague, romanticized version of human love' and the 'love that persists in breaking through resistance.' The depth is found in the 'fear' that follows forgiveness, a paradoxical and non-kitsch concept.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The phrase 'Jesus is the love that upholds the universe' is on the edge of cliché, but is saved by the context of 'messed-up lives'.",
      "The 'watchman' imagery is a bit 'pre-chewed' in homiletic tradition."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of Paul's letter as 'crabbed, tumultuous, disjointed'.",
      "The refusal to remove the 'no health in us' from the theological diagnosis."

    "recommendation": "Maintain the focus on the 'cost' of love and the 'depth' of the predicament to ensure the Gospel remains a 'surprise' rather than a 'cliché'."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened primarily through the 'Reframing' of God as the 'Someone' who pursues us beyond the grave. By emphasizing that God’s love is 'not dependent on the worthiness of the other,' the preacher creates a wide 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers). However, the space is slightly constricted by the didactic tone in the second half, where the preacher 'explains' the Prayer Book. The 'mystery' of the Trinity is made accessible, which is a grace, but perhaps 'explained away' just enough to lose some of its holy 'otherness'.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'miserable offender' and 'plenteous redemption' is well-sustained until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the Trinity is respected as 'dynamic interrelatedness' rather than a logic puzzle.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the sermon is about what God does, not what we must do (except for the 'task' of honesty).",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'depths' of Psalm 130 to remain 'dark' for a bit longer before introducing the 'dawn' to increase the aesthetic impact of grace."

    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high-quality example of the 'New Homiletic' approach, characterized by strong imagery, theological precision, and a clear 'witnessing' stance. Its greatest aesthetic achievement is the 'reframing' of the Trinity through the lens of parental desperation, which moves the doctrine from the head to the heart without sacrificing intellectual integrity. The language is 'stewardly'—it treats words with respect and seeks to recover lost meanings. However, the sermon is aesthetically 'safe.' It follows a predictable movement from problem to solution and maintains a didactic authority that leaves little room for the 'openness' of an 'opera aperta.' It is a sermon of 'sober beauty' rather than 'ecstatic vision.' It avoids the pitfall of kitsch by insisting on the reality of sin, thereby making the 'space for grace' authentic rather than sentimental. While it doesn't break new ground in form, it executes the 'form-follows-text' principle with dignity and clarity.",

      "Read the text aloud during drafting to break up 'bureaucratic' sentence structures."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A solid, aesthetically 'good' sermon (6.8/10). It fulfills the requirements of the 'aesthetic turn' by making the Word sensory and relational. It is a reliable 'witness' that opens space for grace by taking the 'depths' of human existence seriously. It lacks the 'polyphonic' risk-taking of a 9/10 sermon, but it stands as a model of how to handle difficult doctrine with aesthetic care and pastoral urgency."
