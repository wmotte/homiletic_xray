    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher focuses on the 'Sache' of 1 Corinthians 13:7, specifically the fourfold 'all'. Theologically, the sermon attempts to bridge the gap between human experience and divine command. However, the 'blue' side is heavily filtered through a specific ideological critique of church history. While the exegesis is sparse, the dogmatic move—equating the word 'God' with the 'eroticization of the whole'—is a significant theological shift. It moves away from Barth's 'Wholly Other' toward a more immanent, process-oriented theology. The clarity is high, but the theological depth is sacrificed for a singular polemic against the Eros/Agape distinction. It risks reducing the 'living Christ' to a psychological state of 'unrestricted union'.",

        "»Sie verträgt alles, sie glaubt alles, sie hofft alles, sie duldet alles.«",
        "Die radikale Entgegensetzung von Eros und Agape ist einer der peinlichsten, trübsten und katastrophalsten Züge im Christentum",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a high degree of subjective involvement. By admitting 'I have made this experience... in erotic successful relationships,' the preacher moves from a distant proclaimer to a witness of personal biography. This is a bold 'green' signal. There is a clear rejection of the 'clerical mask'. However, the self-revelation is highly intentional (Selbstdarstellung) rather than involuntary (Selbstenthüllung). The preacher presents themselves as someone who has 'seen through' the 'sexist, misanthropic tradition' of the church, positioning themselves as an enlightened, emotionally integrated individual. This borders on the 'Hysterical' type in the Riemann/Denecke typology, seeking the stage for personal liberation.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ehrlich gesagt, ich kenne das, ich habe diese Erfahrung gemacht",
        "Ich habe mich kennengelernt als jemanden, der zu dem großen Alles fähig war",

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Hysterical/Depressive mix. Hysterical in the desire to break boundaries and use personal experience as the primary authority; Depressive in the deep longing for harmony, union, and the removal of all 'separating' barriers.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is prominent. While it serves to illustrate the text, it risks overshadowing the 'Otherness' of the Word by making the preacher's experience the benchmark for truth.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship to the congregation is complex. On one hand, there is a 'we-definition' of shared suffering under 'misanthropic traditions'. On the other hand, there is a subtle paternalism in the 'instruction' (Anleitung) on how to live. The preacher speaks as one who has found the 'key' to a successful life and is now sharing it with the 'un-eroticized' masses. The tone is provocative, designed to disrupt the 'Relationship Ear' of the traditionalist. There is a 'teaching' attitude that assumes the listener is currently 'zerstückelt' (fragmented) and needs the preacher's synthesis to become whole.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ich verstehe das Christentum als eine Anleitung, das Leben so zu leben...",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward a new kind of 'Anspruch' (demand). While it critiques the 'overwhelming demand' of traditional Christianity, it replaces it with a new demand: to 'eroticize the whole' and achieve 'union'. The 'Zuspruch' (promise) is present—God is the state of 'everything'—but it is a promise that requires the listener to first deconstruct their traditional faith. The 'red' side is a call to a specific psychological and relational state. From a Barthian perspective, the 'Gift' (Gospel) is subordinated to the 'Action' (human erotic expansion). The pressure on the listener is high: if you aren't experiencing this 'everything', you are likely a victim of 'fragmentation' or 'sexist tradition'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wäre weniger nicht mehr? ... Weniger als alles kann den Menschen nicht befriedigen",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 5.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a vivid example of 'Experience-Homiletics' where the psychological 'Self-revelation' side becomes the primary hermeneutical key. The preacher successfully deconstructs a sterile, legalistic understanding of Agape, which is a necessary task. However, in doing so, they fall into the trap of 'unhealthy psychologization' (Barthian warning). God is reduced to a 'vokabel' (vocabulary word) for a human state of being. Theologically, the sermon lacks the 'Extra Nos' of the Gospel; the 'everything' is something the human achieves or experiences, rather than something Christ has achieved for the human. The 'Healing Disruption' is present but marred by a polemical tone that may repel the 'Relationship Ear' of the congregation. The score of 5.8 reflects a sermon that is communicatively 'satisfactory' and provocative but lacks the theological balance and 'diaconal' humility required for a higher rating. It is a 'Compulsive-Hysterical' attempt to force a new, vitalistic dogma onto the text.",
    "barthian_warning": "High degree of psychologization. God becomes an object of human erotic experience ('vokabel') rather than the Acting Subject who speaks through the Word.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Radical honesty and authenticity.",
      "Effective critique of destructive dualisms.",
      "Strong, memorable imagery."

    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Re-center the 'Sache' on Christ rather than the preacher's experience.",
      "Soften the polemic to allow the 'Yellow Ear' to remain open.",
      "Balance the 'Anspruch' of erotic union with the 'Zuspruch' of grace for the broken."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A courageous but imbalanced sermon that risks replacing one form of legalism (moralism) with another (vitalism)."
