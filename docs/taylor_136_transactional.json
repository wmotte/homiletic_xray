    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of using high-affect language to bypass the Adult ego and speak directly to the Child. While it offers significant comfort (NP) and authentic inspiration (FC), it utilizes a 'Bait and Switch' dynamic where human suffering is justified as a divine 'blow' intended to force submission. The preacher’s admission of difficulty in caring for 'lukewarm' members introduces a subtle Persecutor element that conditions grace on loyalty.",

      "Over-idealization of trauma ('the best fall he ever had') can be psychologically damaging.",
      "The Critical Parent 'sorting' of congregants creates a culture of fear and performance.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult engagement limits the listener's personal agency."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as Adult subjects capable of choosing God without being 'knocked down.' Avoid using the pulpit to vent frustrations about 'lukewarm' members, as this creates a 'NIGYSOB' atmosphere. Focus on how the 'Free Child's' joy can lead to service, rather than the 'Adapted Child's' fear."
