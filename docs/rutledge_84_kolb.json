    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a direct, sober connection to the shared human reality of mortality. It avoids sentimental 'hooks' in favor of an existential common ground. The preacher uses the Larkin poem to evoke the visceral 'dread of dying.' However, the experience remains somewhat intellectualized through poetry rather than a specific, localized narrative of the congregation's immediate life, though the universal nature of the topic compensates for this.",
      "quotes": [

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher poses a critical, reflective question about the nature of worship itself—asking if it is merely a 'moth-eaten musical brocade.' She explores the 'why' of the human condition (idolatry in Ezekiel, the delay of Jesus in John) and pauses to consider the different perspectives of Jews and Christians regarding the dry bones. The problem of death is explored as a 'special way of being afraid' that no trick dispels.",
      "quotes": [
        "Is this worship today in this cathedral a 'vast, moth-eaten musical brocade,' and are we here to pretend?",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides solid exegesis of both Ezekiel and John. It identifies a 'big idea': that God’s action is unconditional and rooted in His nature as the one who raises the dead. The distinction between 'general resurrection' and Christ as the 'present resurrection' is a clear theological framework. However, the exegesis of Ezekiel is somewhat brief, focusing more on the 'speaking of God' than the mechanics of the text.",

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. The sermon concludes with a call to 'believe,' which is central but remains largely internal and abstract. While the story of von Moltke provides a model of 'small decisions,' the preacher does not translate this into specific action steps for the 2008 congregation. The application is more about an internal shift in perspective than a concrete ethical call to action.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a sophisticated theological reflection that successfully integrates secular literature and historical biography to address the universal human condition of mortality. It begins strongly by grounding the hearer in the 'Concrete Experience' of death and moves into a deep 'Reflective Observation' using the Larkin poem to challenge the authenticity of religious practice. The 'Abstract Conceptualization' is solid, providing a clear theological big idea: God’s resurrection power is an unconditional expression of His nature. However, the sermon falls short in 'Active Experimentation.' While the von Moltke story is powerful, it serves more as an inspiring vision than a practical guide. The call to action is limited to an internal assent of faith ('Do you believe this?'), leaving the 'Converging' learner without concrete handles for daily life. The balance is tilted toward the 'Diverging' and 'Assimilating' styles, offering high imaginative and intellectual value but low pragmatic utility.",

      "Ensure the 'Abstract Conceptualization' leads to a specific 'Active Experimentation' step"
    ],
    "conclusion": "This is a strong, intellectually rigorous sermon that effectively completes three of the four Kolb phases. It excels in creating a 'Visionary' and 'Reflective' space for the hearer to confront mortality and the character of God. Its primary diagnostic weakness is the lack of pragmatic application. For a National Cathedral audience, the high-literary and historical approach is appropriate, but from a learning-theory perspective, it risks leaving the hearer in a state of 'abstract idealism.' The priority for improvement is to translate the 'majestic truths' into 'servant leadership'—giving the congregation concrete ways to respond to the Word in their specific social and personal contexts."
