    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience primarily through the vivid retelling of the biblical narrative. The preacher attempts to bridge the gap between the ancient text and the hearer's life by identifying universal human conditions like anxiety and addiction. However, it lacks a contemporary 'slice of life' story or a specific modern illustration that would allow the hearer to feel the experience in their own skin before moving to the text.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher pauses to ask 'why' the conflict occurs, specifically pointing to the economic and social structures that benefit from enslavement. He analyzes the 'problem' of the text (the pimps' anger) and reflects on why the Gospel is perceived as a threat to social order. It moves beyond the 'what' to the 'why' of human resistance to freedom.",

      "analysis": "The sermon provides a solid theological framework by linking the narrative to the liturgical themes of Ascension and the 'rule of Jesus.' The 'big idea' is the transformative power of Jesus' name to restore true selfhood. The exegesis is traceable, though it prioritizes thematic synthesis over technical word studies or historical-critical depth.",

      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the sermon calls for a 'decision' and 'referring our lives to Jesus,' it remains at a high level of abstraction. There are few concrete action steps or ethical calls that a hearer could implement on Monday morning. The 'how' of being 'unafraid and filled with joy' is left to the hearer's imagination.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of narrative-theological preaching that effectively uses the liturgical calendar to frame a biblical text. It succeeds in creating a 'Visionary' and 'Reflective' space for the hearer, particularly through its sharp critique of the economic and psychological bondages of modern life. However, it falls short of completing the Kolb cycle by failing to provide concrete 'Active Experimentation.' The preacher identifies the 'what' and the 'why' with clarity but leaves the 'how' largely unaddressed. The transition from the biblical narrative to the hearer's life is made through general existential categories (anxiety, consumerism) rather than specific, recognizable modern experiences. While the sermon is intellectually and imaginatively stimulating, it risks remaining in the realm of 'abstract idealism' for the more practically-minded hearer.",

      "Experiment with a more 'Pragmatic' structure to balance the narrative-visionary dominance."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a well-crafted theological reflection that excels in the 'Reflective Observation' and 'Visionary' quadrants of the Homiletic Window. It provides the hearer with a compelling narrative and a clear theological lens (the Rule of Jesus) through which to view human bondage and freedom. However, from a Kolb perspective, the cycle remains incomplete. The lack of specific, practical application (Active Experimentation) and the reliance on general existential categories rather than concrete modern experiences limit its impact on 'holistic learning.' It is an excellent sermon for 'Diverging' and 'Assimilating' learners but offers little for the 'Converging' hearer who seeks to put faith into practice. The priority for improvement is the development of the pragmatic task: converting high-level theological insights into 'servant leadership' handles for the congregation."
