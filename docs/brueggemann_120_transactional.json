    "summary": "This sermon is exceptionally healthy from a TA perspective. It avoids the common 'Critical Parent' traps of stewardship (guilt-tripping) and instead uses the 'Adult' ego state to analyze the 'Old Self' as a series of dysfunctional scripts. By identifying with the listeners' struggle, the preacher maintains a level, non-manipulative transaction. The focus on 'impossible' grace moves the discourse from a 'Child' seeking approval to an 'Adult' receiving a gift.",

      "High level of Adult-to-Adult transparency.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize the 'we' in the struggle to prevent the preacher from being cast as the 'Rescuer' in the Drama Triangle."
