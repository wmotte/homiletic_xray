    "summary": "The sermon creates a strong 'in-group' vs 'out-group' dynamic. While it provides high levels of Nurturing Parent support for those present, it relies on a Critical Parent framework to devalue those absent. This risks fostering spiritual pride or a 'martyr complex' in the listeners. The preacher's vulnerability regarding the healing story is a high point of Adult-Adult transparency, but the overall structure reinforces a Parent-Child dependency where the preacher defines the listeners' 'special' status.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the 'Easter-only' crowd without the Critical Parent judgment; assume they are on their own Adult journey. Focus more on the 'Free Child' joy of the Resurrection rather than the 'Critical Parent' weight of the Cross to balance the psychological load."
