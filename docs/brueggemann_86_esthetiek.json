    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes strong, archetypal imagery rooted in biblical theology. Brueggemann (if the author) excels at 'painting' the movement of God through history using sensory-adjacent concepts like 'primordial chaos' and 'barrenness'. The metaphor of the 'launching pad' for new life is a modern, surprising touch that avoids religious stagnation. However, some images remain slightly abstract (e.g., 'dismal modes of chaos') rather than fully sensory. The use of the 'grain of wheat' in the final section provides a concrete biological anchor for the theological concept of resurrection, successfully applying Wilson's 'show, don't tell' by grounding the 'newness' in the soil.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is precise in its theological intent, particularly in the 'reframing' of Torah as an 'icon of sanity'. There is a clear attempt to avoid 'Canaanite' jargon by translating concepts like 'sin' into 'destructive recalcitrance' and 'iniquity' into 'holding a grudge'. However, the repetitive use of 'imperial system' and 'God of the gospel' borders on a different kind of academic-homiletical jargon. The stewardship of language is evident in the rhythmic triads (promise, presence, power), but the prose occasionally feels more like a lecture than a poetic invocation.",

        "destructive recalcitrance, thinking they could have life on their own terms.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a high-performing area. The sermon possesses a distinct 'cadence' and 'staccato' rhythm characteristic of prophetic rhetoric. The use of anaphora ('It is this God... It is this God...') creates a liturgical momentum that builds toward the Jeremiah text. The variation in sentence length—moving from long, descriptive clauses to short, declarative bursts ('That is life out of death!')—creates a natural 'flow' for oral delivery. The rhythmic repetition serves as a heartbeat for the sermon, making it highly memorable and aurally engaging.",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is rhetorically powerful, characterized by a prophetic cadence and a successful 'reframing' of biblical concepts into socio-political realities. It avoids traditional clichés by substituting them with fresh, albeit repetitive, terminology like 'imperial systems' and 'recalcitrance'. The imagery is grounded in the biblical narrative, effectively 'showing' God's historical movement. While the repetition of certain phrases is high, it serves a liturgical purpose, creating a sense of urgency and continuity that is aesthetically consistent with the Reformed tradition of 'sober beauty'."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'salvation-historical' arc rather than a 'Lowry loop' or a narrative plot. It begins with a thesis (God brings life out of death), provides historical evidence (Creation, Abraham, Exodus), moves to the prophetic promise (Jeremiah), and concludes with a call to action (John 12). While there is movement, the 'upsetting of the equilibrium' is intellectual rather than experiential. The tension is maintained through the repetition of 'deathly systems' versus 'newness', but the 'turning point' is more of a gradual revelation than a dramatic shift. It feels like a steady climb rather than a journey with twists.",
      "quotes": [
        "The core truth of our faith is this...",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. Cilliers' concept of 'reframing' is perfectly executed here. The biblical world (Exodus, Exile, Torah) is not merely 'explained' but is used as a lens to look at modern 'imperial systems of economics'. The transition from the 'scroll' to 'inhaling' the Torah is a brilliant aesthetic bridge between the ancient text and the modern psyche. It respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the 'Bees' in Psalm 119) while making it immediately relevant to contemporary issues of 'solidarity between rich and poor'.",

        "the imperial system of economics in which we live.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is rhetorically brilliant, it leans toward being a 'closed' work of art. The preacher as 'witness' (Long) is very much in control of the interpretation. The 'imperial system' is the clear antagonist, and 'newness' is the clear solution. There is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or for the hearer who might find the 'imperial' critique too simplistic. It is a 'proclamation' that demands a specific response ('Give it up'). While it opens 'space for grace', it does so through a fairly rigid thematic structure that doesn't leave many 'open ends' for the hearer to wander in.",
      "quotes": [
        "The core truth of our faith is this...",
        "I do not need to tell you that in our society now, we must die...",

        "Acknowledge the difficulty or 'resistance' (Stark) one might feel toward 'giving up' wealth."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "A monovalent work of art; highly focused and directed toward a single interpretive goal."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is a robust, salvation-historical progression that excels in 'reframing' ancient texts for a modern socio-economic context. It moves with a clear, rhythmic momentum from the 'then' of the biblical narrative to the 'now' of the hearer's life. While it lacks a traditional narrative plot, its thematic consistency creates a powerful sense of 'event'. However, the structure is quite 'closed', leaving little room for alternative interpretations or the 'messiness' of doubt, functioning more as a prophetic manifesto than an 'open work of art'."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by grounding 'newness' in the 'dread' of the execution and the 'inconvenience' of obedience. There is no 'cheap comfort' here; the 'new life' requires a 'dying' to wealth and power. It avoids sentimentality by using rigorous, almost clinical language ('imperial systems', 'recalcitrance') to describe the human condition. The 'joy' mentioned is not a surface-level emotion but a 'wave' that follows 'negation'. It takes the 'pain of suffering' seriously by acknowledging the 'insane world' and the 'deathly' nature of our current systems.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The mention of 'waves of joy' is the only moment that flirts with sentiment, but it is quickly anchored in 'obedience'.",
      "The 'Messiah' reference could be seen as a 'cultural cliché', but it is used to support a theological point about comfort."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the Torah as an 'icon of sanity in an insane world'.",
      "The call to 'die to old assumptions about wealth and power'."

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'reframing' of God as the one who 'makes a way out of no way'. By emphasizing that God 'holds no grudge' and 'keeps no score', the sermon creates a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) that is not dependent on human effort. However, the 'moralization' in the final section ('we must die to...', 'inconvenient obedience') slightly closes that space by turning the 'gift' back into a 'task'. The 'mystery' of the resurrection is respected by calling it an 'Easter mouthful', acknowledging its overwhelming nature.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'deathly systems' and 'new life' is sustained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'abrupt' nature of God's intervention is highlighted, respecting the 'otherness' of God.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the first three sections, but moralization takes the lead in the final section.",
    "recommendation": "End with the 'readiness of God to give' rather than the 'inconvenience of our obedience' to keep the space for grace fully open."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'Prophetic-Reframing'. Its primary power lies in its rhythmic, oral quality and its ability to synthesize ancient biblical motifs with contemporary socio-economic critiques. It avoids the 'kitsch' of easy evangelicalism by insisting on the 'death' that precedes 'resurrection'. The language is 'stewarded' with care, using precise, non-traditional terms to wake the hearer from 'religious slumber'. While it lacks the 'openness' of a narrative work of art, its 'sober beauty' and 'rhetorical momentum' create a compelling 'event' in the sense of Immink. It is a sermon that 'shows' God's power through the sweep of history, even if it 'tells' the hearer what the contemporary application must be.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rhythmic, anaphoric cadence that creates a powerful oral 'event'.",
      "Sophisticated 'reframing' of the Torah and Exile for a modern context.",
      "Complete avoidance of religious kitsch and cheap sentimentality."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase 'openness' by allowing for more mystery and less prescriptive application.",
      "Reduce the repetition of key phrases ('God of the gospel', 'imperial system') to maintain impact.",
      "Ground the 'deathly systems' in more concrete, sensory imagery rather than ideological abstractions."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Rhetorical (Sober-Reformed with a socio-critical edge)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Preacher as Witness' of Thomas Long.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'socially-conscious' hearers and those weary of traditional 'Canaanite' language.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a 'Lowry Loop' structure to increase narrative tension.",
      "Use more 'sensory' language in the 'trouble' sections (Domain A1).",
      "End with a poetic image or an open question to increase 'polyvalence' (Domain B3)."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust performance of the 'Aesthetic Turn'. It demonstrates that 'how' something is said (rhythm, reframing) is essential to 'what' is said (the radicality of resurrection). It is a 'sober' work that avoids the 'visual excess' of kitsch, opting instead for the 'beauty of simplicity' and the 'power of metaphor'. While it borders on the 'academic-declarative' at times, its rhythmic pulse ensures it remains a 'happening' rather than just a 'document'. It successfully opens a 'Space for Grace' by presenting a God who is 'on the loose' and 'ready to give'."
