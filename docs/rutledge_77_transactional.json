    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically sophisticated and exceptionally healthy. It uses TA-adjacent concepts (projections of parental figures) to dismantle religious manipulation. By identifying the 'Critical Parent' as a human projection rather than a divine attribute, the preacher facilitates a move from a fear-based Adapted Child response to an Adult/Free Child state of grace.",

      "The use of the Franklin Graham story, while effective in 1994, carries heavy baggage today (as noted in the footnote), which might trigger a 'Crossed Transaction' for modern listeners."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'I' statements regarding failure. Ensure that the 'Adult' processing of the text remains the primary bridge before moving into the 'Nurturing Parent' comfort."
