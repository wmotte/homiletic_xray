    "summary": "The sermon is intellectually stimulating (Adult) but psychologically heavy (Critical Parent). It utilizes 'shame-by-association' by linking the quiet congregation in Salisbury to global atrocities to justify the 'righteous wrath' of God. While it successfully moves away from a 'Childish' view of the Bible, it replaces it with a 'Parental' view that emphasizes human worthlessness and divine sovereignty, potentially fostering a 'Not-OK' life position in the listener.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation's actual life-world (Adult) rather than using global horrors to force a 'Child' response of guilt. Balance the 'Critical Parent' view of sin with an 'Adult' exploration of how grace empowers personal agency today."
