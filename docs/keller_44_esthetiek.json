    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily as a bridge to conceptual understanding rather than for purely sensory immersion. While Keller references 'palm branches' and the 'donkey,' he spends more time analyzing the *meaning* of these symbols than 'painting' the scene for the hearer's imagination. He effectively uses cultural imagery—the 'hobbit,' 'Sancho Panza,' and 'millionaires'—to ground abstract concepts of kingship. However, the biblical world remains somewhat secondary to the conceptual framework. The imagery of the 'memory trace' and the 'rustling leaves of the Bible' provides a poetic touch, but the overall approach is more 'tell' than 'show,' as he explains the mechanics of the imagery rather than letting the images speak for themselves. The sensory details are sparse; we don't smell the dust of the road or hear the specific timbre of the shouting crowd.",
      "quotes": [
        "That’s something a child rides on or a hobbit or Sancho Panza. Kings ride on war horses.",
        "All the leaves of the Bible are rustling. They’re just rustling... with the whisper and the rumor that the King will come again.",

        "Increase sensory descriptions of the biblical scene (the heat, the noise, the physical texture of the cloaks).",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Predominantly 'telling.' Images are introduced as illustrations for points rather than as the primary vehicle of the experience."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Language care is a hallmark of this text. Keller practices 'stewardship of language' by avoiding traditional 'Canaanite' jargon or, when using it (like 'Messiah' or 'Redeemer'), defining it through human experience. He is precise in his psychological observations, such as the 'panic' of losing control or the 'memory trace' of a lost king. The word choice is economical and hits the core of the modern listener's struggle with authority. He avoids vague platitudes, instead offering nuanced descriptions of how a career or a relationship can 'oppress' a person. The language is 'loving' in the sense that it respects the listener's intellectual objections and addresses them with clarity and lack of obfuscation.",
      "quotes": [
        "You can’t say, ‘Come in Jesus as my caregiver; stay out as my Lord.’ He’s both.",
        "If you only obey me because you understand why I’m telling you to do this, then that’s not obedience; it’s agreement.",
        "Spiritual nature, like bodily nature, will be served; deny it food and it will gobble poison."

      "strengths": [
        "Exceptional clarity in defining theological terms through psychological and sociological lenses.",
        "Precise distinction between 'obedience' and 'agreement,' which cuts through modern misconceptions.",
        "Avoidance of religious clichés in favor of fresh, analytical language."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The language is occasionally overly 'professorial,' which can create a distance between the heart and the message.",
        "Some repetitive phrases ('that’s what it means,' 'do you see?') could be tightened for better flow.",
        "Could incorporate more 'vulnerable' language to balance the high-level analytical precision."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Exemplary. Religious jargon is consistently translated into 'secular' equivalents (e.g., idolatry becomes 'what you live for')."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The rhythm is that of a teacher or a conversationalist rather than a poet. There is a clear 'staccato' in the delivery—short, punchy sentences that drive home logical points. This creates a sense of urgency and clarity, but it lacks the 'legato' of contemplative or liturgical beauty. The musicality is found in the repetition of key phrases ('true King,' 'weak King') which acts as a rhythmic anchor. However, the sentence structure is often functional and 'paper-like,' designed to convey information and conviction rather than to evoke a sense of the 'holy happening' through sound. It is very much 'oral language,' but it is the language of the lecture hall more than the cathedral.",
      "quotes": [
        "He’s the true King, he’s the weak King, and how he can be your King.",
        "You’ve crowned it. That career is driving you. It’s in control of you.",
        "Crown me or kill me."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong use of repetition and parallelism to reinforce the three-point structure.",
        "The 'staccato' rhythm effectively mirrors the 'forcing of the hand' theme of the sermon.",
        "Natural oral flow that avoids the stiffness of a read manuscript."

        "Incorporate more lyrical or poetic passages to allow for moments of reflection and awe.",
        "Vary sentence length more intentionally to create a more dynamic 'musical' experience.",
        "Use more rhetorical figures like alliteration or assonance to make key truths more 'sticky' in the ear."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Highly oral, but specifically 'conversational-analytical' rather than 'poetic-liturgical'."
    },
    "average_score_language": 6.67,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by exceptional precision and clarity, functioning as a sharp tool for 'reframing' the listener's reality. While it lacks the sensory richness of Wilson’s 'imagery' or the poetic cadence of traditional Reformed 'sober beauty,' it excels in 'stewardship of the word.' It translates ancient concepts into modern psychological categories with surgical accuracy. The aesthetic strength lies in its intellectual honesty and the 'sober' power of its logic, though it occasionally risks becoming too academic at the expense of sensory immersion."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium'—challenging the modern notion of autonomy ('We serve no sovereign here'). It introduces a conflict: we claim to want no king, yet we are obsessed with them and oppressed by our own 'crowns.' The movement from 'True King' to 'Weak King' serves as the turning point, where the 'trouble' of oppression meets the 'grace' of the Redeemer. The energy is sustained through a logical progression that feels like a journey of discovery. However, the structure remains a fairly traditional 'three-point' model, which, while dynamic in content, can feel slightly predictable in form.",
      "quotes": [
        "We serve no sovereign here. That’s America.",
        "I immediately need to deal with your panic, because modern people are panicked by the idea that they’re going to lose control.",
        "He was saying, ‘Crown me or kill me,’ and that’s what they did."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong opening that immediately identifies a 'conflict' in the hearer's own life/culture.",
        "The transition to the 'Weak King' provides a genuine 'aha!' moment that resolves the tension of authority.",
        "The conclusion brings the narrative of the Triumphal Entry to a sharp, personal 'decision point'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition between the three main points could be more organic and less like a numbered list.",
        "The 'how to' section at the end feels slightly more like a 'teaching' block than a 'narrative' resolution.",
        "Could utilize the 'story' of the disciples getting the donkey as a more central narrative thread throughout."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey disguised as a three-point structure; it moves from cultural analysis to theological paradox to personal application."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. Keller masterfully 'reframes' (Cilliers) the biblical text through the lens of modern sociology and psychology. He connects the 'Davidic King' of Psalm 118 with the 'Once and Future King' of Arthurian legend and the 'messianic' figures of modern fantasy and politics. He respects the 'strangeness' of the donkey but immediately makes it relevant by explaining it as a 'message' about power. The synthesis is not forced; it feels as though the text is truly shedding light on the 'hidden kings' of the New Yorker's heart (career, relationships, etc.). It offers a new frame where 'freedom' is redefined not as lack of authority, but as serving the right King.",
      "quotes": [
        "The fantasy fiction is filled with messianic heroes... It’s a memory trace in you and me.",
        "You’ve crowned something or you can’t live. Listen to me.",
        "If you’re living for your career... It’s punishing you because you’re failing it. It’s a lord."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of idolatry as 'crowning' something to give life meaning.",
        "Seamless integration of C.S. Lewis, Arthurian legend, and modern 'panic' over control.",
        "The biblical text is not a 'springboard' but the 'lens' through which the modern world is diagnosed."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could engage more with the specific 'Lukan' nuances (e.g., why Luke omits the palms) beyond the initial mention.",
        "The connection to the 'stones crying out' could be more deeply integrated into the 'reframing' of nature.",
        "Ensure the 'historical' context of the text (Romans vs. Jews) isn't entirely eclipsed by the 'psychological' context."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strongly present. The sermon fundamentally changes the frame of 'authority' from 'oppression' to 'liberation/creation'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "In terms of Ciska Stark’s 'open work of art,' this sermon leans toward being 'closed.' Keller’s logic is so tight and his 'reframing' so comprehensive that there is little room for the hearer to wander or interpret differently. He anticipates and answers every objection. While this is rhetorically effective, it can feel 'coercive' in its logic. The ending, 'Crown me or kill me,' is a powerful binary that forces a decision rather than inviting a polyvalent reflection. It respects the 'ambivalence of existence' (the pain of serving false kings), but it resolves the mystery of grace into a very clear 'yoke' of obedience. It is a 'witness' (Long) that is very sure of its testimony.",
      "quotes": [
        "I immediately need to deal with your panic...",
        "I’ll show you what this means...",
        "He says, ‘I will be in your life as a King, or I won’t be in your life at all.’"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The 'Weak King' concept leaves room for the mystery of the cross and divine vulnerability.",
        "Acknowledges the 'struggle' and 'panic' of the listener, treating them as a mature conversation partner.",
        "The 'memory trace' idea allows for a sense of universal human longing that is 'open' to all."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Leave some questions unanswered to allow the Holy Spirit more 'space' to work in the listener's unique context.",
        "Avoid the 'I'll show you what this means' language, which positions the preacher as the sole interpreter.",
        "Allow the conclusion to be more of an invitation into a mystery than a logical ultimatum."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Monovalent. The sermon is a 'closed system' of brilliant logic that leaves little room for 'appropriation' other than total acceptance or rejection."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is a masterclass in 'reframing' contemporary life through the biblical narrative. It creates a compelling arc from the 'trouble' of modern autonomy to the 'grace' of a King who dies for his subjects. While the structure is logically 'sealed shut'—leaving little room for the 'openness' Stark advocates—it is highly effective as a 'performance' of the Gospel's claim on the heart. It moves the listener from the mind (understanding kingship) to the will (the yoke of obedience) to the heart (the beauty of the Redeemer)."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'cheap comfort' and 'pre-chewed emotions.' Instead of a 'happy ending' cliché, it presents the 'Weak King' who goes to a cross to 'bear judgment.' Keller takes the 'pain of suffering' and the 'oppression' of modern life seriously. There is no sentimentality here; the 'emotion' is authentic, grounded in the 'divine wrath' and the 'terrible wounding' of the King. He avoids the 'kitsch' of immediate moral victory, noting that 'there is still suffering in this world.' The aesthetic depth comes from the 'sober' confrontation with the reality of sin and the radicality of the cross.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None identified. The sermon actively deconstructs 'warm fuzzy' versions of Jesus.",
      "Avoids the 'happy ending' by pointing to the 'Crown me or kill me' ultimatum."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The analysis of how a career or children can become 'oppressive lords' that 'punish' you.",
      "The description of Jesus as a 'laughingstock' riding a donkey, rejecting 'superhero' power."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'anti-kitsch' stance by continuing to ground grace in the 'weakness' and 'suffering' of the cross rather than in sentimental feelings."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened primarily through the 'reframing' of Jesus as the 'Weak King.' By showing that Jesus 'takes the divine wrath' so he can 'forgive you,' Keller creates a 'space' where the listener is no longer crushed by the 'lords' of their own making. However, this space is somewhat narrowed by the heavy emphasis on 'unconditional obedience' and the 'yoke' at the end. While theologically sound, the 'aesthetic' of grace—the sense of the 'unavailable' and the 'mystery'—is sometimes eclipsed by the 'ethical' demand. The 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) is present in the 'Redeemer' section but feels slightly 'closed' by the 'moralization' of the three-way response.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'King' and 'Weakness' is beautifully sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the 'unbroken animal' and the 'stones crying out' is respected as a sign of the 'consummated kingdom.'",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the 'Weak King' section, but moralization (the 'musts' of worship/obey/expect) takes over in the final third.",
    "recommendation": "To create more space, allow the 'beauty' of the King to be the primary motivator for change, rather than the 'ultimatum' of the yoke."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high-quality example of 'Sober-Reformed' aesthetics integrated with contemporary 'Reframing.' Its aesthetic power lies not in poetic ornamentation or emotional manipulation, but in the 'beauty of simplicity' and the 'stewardship of language.' It excels in Domain B (Structure/Integration), where it creates a compelling synthesis between the biblical world and the modern psyche. It effectively avoids 'religious kitsch' by grounding its message in the 'weakness' of the cross. However, it scores lower on 'Openness' and 'Imagery,' as it prioritizes logical clarity and 'telling' the meaning over 'showing' the mystery. It is an aesthetically 'strong' work that functions as a 'witness' to the King, though it leans more toward the 'Academic-Declarative' than the 'Poetic-Imagistic.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'Reframing' of biblical kingship for a modern, autonomy-seeking audience.",
      "Complete absence of religious kitsch; maintains authentic theological depth through the 'Weak King' paradox.",
      "Exceptional 'Stewardship of Language'—precise, clear, and jargon-free."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase 'Openness' by allowing more room for the hearer's own interpretation and the mystery of the Spirit.",
      "Shift the balance from 'Telling' to 'Showing' by using more sensory, vivid imagery of the biblical narrative.",
      "Soften the 'logical ultimatum' at the end to allow the 'Space for Grace' to remain the final aesthetic impression."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Analytical-Reframing (Sober-Reformed)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing) and Thomas G. Long (The Preacher as Witness).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals most to 'Urban Intellectuals' and 'Skeptics' who value logical coherence, psychological depth, and cultural relevance over traditional liturgical 'beauty.'",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'Narrative-Dramatic' structure that lets the story of the text drive the movement.",
      "Incorporate a 'Page 2' (Wilson) that more vividly paints the 'trouble' of the biblical world to mirror the modern 'trouble.'",
      "Use more 'poetic' pauses and rhythmic variation to enhance the 'oral event' of the preaching."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust 'event' that successfully 'reframes' the Triumphal Entry for a contemporary audience. By avoiding kitsch and focusing on the 'Weak King' paradox, it creates a genuine encounter with the 'Holy' as a reality that challenges and transforms. While its 'closed' logical structure and 'telling' style prevent it from being a 'model' of the 'open work of art,' it remains a powerful example of how 'form is content' in the Reformed tradition—where the 'beauty' is found in the clarity and radicality of the Gospel proclamation itself."
