    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and demonstrates high communicative purity. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the 'Critical Parent' by using 'we' language and acknowledging the reality of human exhaustion. By distinguishing between the 'What' (Adult processing of theology) and the 'When' (Acceptance of mystery), the preacher empowers the listener's Adult ego state. The use of the airport metaphor successfully taps into the 'Free Child' without becoming sentimental or manipulative.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult address.",
      "Avoidance of the 'Rescuer' trap by emphasizing mystery over easy answers.",
      "Healthy critique of external systems (Empire/Consumerism) without shaming the listener."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The critique of 'consumer fever' could lean into Critical Parent if not careful.",
      "Could further engage the 'Free Child' with more sensory imagery of the 'new world'."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' to maintain the Adult-Adult connection. Ensure that the 'modest gift' of the text remains a tool for the listener's autonomy rather than a prescription for dependency."
