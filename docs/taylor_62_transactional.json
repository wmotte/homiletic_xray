    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of Nurturing Parent communication that borders on 'smothering.' While it offers deep emotional comfort, it does so by first stripping the listener of their Adult agency, labeling all human progress (education, culture) as symptoms of a 'fatal disease.' This creates a high level of psychological dependency on the religious 'Rescuer.'",

      "Potential to induce passivity by devaluing all 'earthly' efforts."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as 'Adults' who can partner with the Divine, rather than 'Victims' who are terminally ill. Balance the Nurturing Parent with Adult data-processing about how to live 'here-and-now' without total dependency."
