    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery primarily derived from the biblical text itself (mud, washing, light). Brueggemann (if the author) tends toward 'rhetorical imagery'—using words to create conceptual landscapes rather than purely sensory ones. While the 'mud on the eyes' is mentioned, the preacher quickly moves to the metaphorical 'clue to reality.' The imagery of 'talk show hosts' and 'credentialed scientists' provides a contemporary visual frame, but the sermon lacks the deep, thick description advocated by Paul Scott Wilson. It 'tells' the theological significance of the light more than it 'shows' the experience of the darkness or the tactile sensation of the miracle. The imagery serves the 'reframing' of the mind more than the stimulation of the senses.",
      "quotes": [
        "he puts mud on the eyes of the blind man, tells him to wash in the pool of Siloam",
        "the theme being, keep things manageable, under control, coherent, sensible, explainable",
        "Keep your head down and avoid eye contact."
      ],

        "Effective use of the 'Light' metaphor as a 'clue to reality'.",
        "Contemporary archetypes (talk show hosts) create immediate mental pictures.",

        "Incorporate more sensory details of the blind man's world (sound, touch, smell).",

        "Use more concrete nouns to ground the abstract concept of 'newness'."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Leans toward 'telling'. The preacher explains the significance of the images rather than letting the images perform the work themselves."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and exhibits high 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre). There is a deliberate avoidance of 'Canaanite jargon' in favor of fresh, provocative descriptors like 'consensus epistemology,' 'disturbing novelty,' and 'unmanageable evidence.' The preacher carefully nuances the human condition, describing the 'personal, hidden dispute' of the night. Every word feels weighed; there is no 'filler.' The precision lies in the naming of the 'establishment's' tactics—discredit, fear, and censorship. This linguistic care prevents the sermon from falling into easy pieties and forces the hearer to confront the text's radicality through clear, sharp terminology.",
      "quotes": [
        "the reasoned consensus epistemology of the day",
        "the same tone of bewildered certitude is sounded",
        "the unmanageable evidence of my life"

      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Some terms like 'epistemology' or 'novum' might require a brief 'aesthetic' translation for a general audience.",
        "The repetition of 'old' (old fears, old orthodoxies) is effective but borders on a list.",
        "Ensure the 'academic' precision doesn't distance the 'heart' of the hearer."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "The sermon uses academic/philosophical jargon (epistemology, novum) rather than religious jargon. It is used effectively to 'reframe' the gospel for a modern, critical mind."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a rhythmic, almost litany-like quality, especially in Section III where the dialogue is recounted. There is a clear use of parallelism ('all old blindnesses, all old fears, all old orthodoxies'). The cadence is oratorical, designed for the ear, with short, punchy sentences interjected between longer, complex ones. This creates a 'staccato' effect that mirrors the tension of the dispute. The repetition of 'He said... They said...' creates a narrative drive that is musically satisfying. It avoids 'paper language' by maintaining a conversational yet elevated tone that suggests a performance of 'witnessing'.",
      "quotes": [
        "I am the source of light, sight, discernment, understanding.",
        "He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and now I see.",
        "Nothing here about sin and guilt. Nothing here about morality or orthodoxy."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong use of rhythmic repetition and parallelism.",
        "Variation in sentence length creates a dynamic 'flow'.",
        "The dialogue section (III) has a natural, dramatic cadence."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition between Section II and III could use a more melodic bridge.",
        "The concluding paragraph becomes slightly more 'prose-heavy' and loses some of the earlier rhythm.",
        "More use of alliteration could enhance the 'stickiness' of key phrases."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Oral language. The structure is clearly designed for speech and dramatic delivery."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is rhetorically sophisticated and precise, avoiding the 'kitsch' of traditional religious sentiment. While it could benefit from more sensory 'showing,' its strength lies in its 'stewardship of words'—using sharp, intellectual, and rhythmic language to dismantle the hearer's defenses. It is a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that finds beauty in the clarity of truth and the rhythm of dispute."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with the 'upsetting' of equilibrium—the dispute. It moves through the 'complication' of the various interpreters (Pharisees, parents, neighbors) and reaches a 'climax' in the expulsion of the man. The 'turning point' is the return of Jesus in Section IV, which leads to the 'resolution' of self-recognition. The movement is not static; it is a 'dynamic journey' from the public dispute to the personal heart. The preacher keeps the energy high by alternating between the 'trouble' of the resistance and the 'grace' of the miracle.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus... does not do much, except to offer himself as a problem that will not go away.",
        "The resisters to Jesus get a lot of text time. But they are not very interesting.",
        "My job this morning is to invite you into this drama for a moment of self-recognition"

      "strengths": [
        "Clear, logical, and dramatic progression (The Dispute -> The Resisters -> The Witness -> The Clue).",
        "The 're-entry' of Jesus is timed perfectly for maximum impact.",
        "The move from 'them' (Pharisees) to 'us' (the hearers) is handled with dramaturgical skill."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition into the final 'invitation' could be more surprising.",
        "The 'humor/mockery' mentioned in the end could be integrated earlier to lighten the heavy 'dispute' tone.",
        "The ending feels slightly rushed compared to the detailed analysis of the dispute."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "Dynamic journey. It moves from the 'then and there' of the text to the 'here and now' of the hearer's soul."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 9,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. It is a masterclass in 'Reframing' (Cilliers). Brueggemann connects the 1st-century Pharisees with 21st-century 'talk show hosts' and 'scientific certitude' without it feeling forced. He respects the 'strangeness' of the Johannine text while making it a mirror for the modern 'critical temper.' The synthesis is organic: the 'blindness' of the Pharisees is reframed as our own 'privileged' need for control. It doesn't just apply the text; it places the hearer *inside* the text's world, making the ancient dispute a contemporary reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "In our time, it is the talk show hosts, like Rush and Oprah.",
        "the same tone of bewildered certitude is sounded by Jesus’ own disciples",
        "We adhere to old explanations and controls, because that is how we became as privileged as we are."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of biblical characters into modern social roles.",
        "The connection between 'control' and 'blindness' is a profound contextual insight.",
        "Honors the 'strangeness' of Jesus as a 'problem that will not go away'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could include a more specific contemporary 'miracle' or 'novum' to balance the modern 'resistance'.",
        "The mention of 'Rush and Oprah' dates the sermon slightly; more timeless archetypes could be used alongside them.",
        "Ensure the 'scientific' critique doesn't alienate those in the pews who work in those fields."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing. It offers a new lens to see our 'sightedness' as a form of blindness."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon is an 'Open Work of Art' (Stark) in that it invites the hearer to 'play many parts in the drama.' It does not offer a 'neat' moralistic checklist. Instead, it ends with an invitation to 'see differently.' However, the theological framework is quite strong and 'authoritative' in its own way, which might feel 'closed' to those who don't share the preacher's post-liberal perspective. Yet, by acknowledging the 'personal, hidden dispute,' it leaves room for the hearer's own struggle. It sustains the tension between 'already' and 'not yet' without a cheap 'happy ending.'",
      "quotes": [
        "You play many parts in the drama. And if you are like me, the many parts conflict.",
        "Do you also want to become his disciples?",
        "We can refuse to see. But that does not keep the light from doing its transformative work."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The preacher includes himself in the 'blindness,' creating a shared space.",
        "The ending is an 'offer,' not a 'command'.",
        "Acknowledges the 'ambivalence' of the believer's life."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The final 'Thanks be to God' is a bit of a liturgical 'seal' that could be more open.",
        "Could leave more 'unanswered' questions regarding the man's life after expulsion.",
        "The 'clue to reality' language is slightly dogmatic; more 'mystery' could be allowed."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Polyvalent. It allows the hearer to identify with the parents, the Pharisees, or the man."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 8.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are superb. The sermon is a well-constructed 'event' that moves with purpose. Its ability to 'reframe' the ancient text into a contemporary drama of power, control, and sight is its hallmark. It avoids the static 'three-point' trap and instead creates a space where the 'holy happens' through the confrontation with the 'unmanageable evidence' of grace."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. There are no 'pre-chewed' emotions or easy comforts. Brueggemann avoids the 'sentimental' approach to a healing story (e.g., 'Jesus loves the little blind boy') and instead focuses on the 'harsh' reality of social expulsion and the 'problem' of Jesus. The 'happy ending' of the man seeing is immediately complicated by his banishment. This is 'authentic aesthetic depth' that takes the 'pain of suffering' and the 'cost of discipleship' seriously. It refuses to 'smooth over' the dispute.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None found. It explicitly rejects 'deathly explanations and controls' that often characterize kitsch."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'hidden dispute people conduct alone deep in the night'.",
      "The admission that 'the many parts conflict' within the preacher himself."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'prophetic' edge; it is the best defense against the 'kitschification' of the gospel."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully 'opens space for grace' (Cilliers) by defining grace as a 'disturbing novelty' and 'unmanageable evidence.' It doesn't 'close' the space with moralism; in fact, it explicitly states, 'Nothing here about sin and guilt. Nothing here about morality or orthodoxy.' Instead, it presents grace as a 'new world of possibility' that 'shatters' old controls. The tension between the 'old world' and the 'newness of Jesus' is sustained throughout. The 'mystery' of Jesus as the 'clue' is respected, even as it is proclaimed.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between the 'privileged' world and the 'expelled' truth is held until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, Jesus is presented as a 'problem' and an 'astonishing thing' rather than a solved puzzle.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. The ethical 'reorientation' is presented as a consequence of the gift, not a prerequisite.",
    "recommendation": "To increase space even further, the preacher could dwell more on the 'silence' or 'darkness' before the light, allowing the 'not yet' to breathe more."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the 'prophetic-imaginal' style. Its strength lies in its 'macro-aesthetics'—the way it structures the 'event' of preaching as a dramatic confrontation between the 'old world' of control and the 'new world' of Jesus. The language is precise, rhythmic, and intellectually stimulating, though it occasionally favors theological 'telling' over sensory 'showing.' It avoids religious kitsch with surgical precision, offering instead a 'sober beauty' that is transparent to the radicality of the Gospel. It creates a 'space for grace' by dismantling the hearer's 'bewildered certitude' and inviting them into a 'new mode of life' that is both gift and disruption.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'Reframing' of text and context.",
      "High 'Stewardship of Language' and precision.",
      "Dynamic 'Narrative Arc' that creates genuine tension."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase sensory 'Imagery' (Domain A1).",
      "Soften the 'Academic' tone to increase emotional accessibility.",
      "Allow for more 'Openness' in the liturgical conclusion."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Rhetorical (Sober-Reformed with a Post-liberal edge)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Kitsch-resistance) and Thomas Long (Form follows text).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'critical' thinkers, intellectuals, and those weary of 'sentimental' religion. It challenges the 'privileged' hearer.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'showing' the miracle through the man's other senses (touch, sound).",
      "Use a more 'poetic' rather than 'analytical' vocabulary in the final invitation.",
      "Explore the 'Inter-esse' (Cilliers) by spending more time in the 'between' space of the man's expulsion."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically high-quality 'performance' of the Gospel. It functions as an 'open work' that respects the hearer's intelligence while firmly placing them within the 'drama of Jesus.' Its refusal to settle for kitsch or easy moralism makes it a powerful 'event' of truth-telling. While the poetics of language could be more 'vivid' in a sensory sense, the dramaturgy of the structure is nearly flawless, making it a compelling example of modern homiletic excellence."
