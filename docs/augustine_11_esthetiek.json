    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in sensory and medical imagery, particularly in §2. It avoids abstract pneumatology by employing the 'finger of God' as a surgical instrument. The imagery of the soul as a 'torn sack' and a 'house' being renovated provides a visceral sense of human fragility and divine restoration. The use of 'wine, oil, and purest myrrh' appeals to the olfactory and tactile senses, grounding the spiritual work of the Spirit in physical reality. This 'showing' rather than 'telling' allows the hearer to visualize the process of sanctification as a tangible healing of wounds and a reconstruction of a dwelling. The metaphors are living and evocative, drawing from both biblical tradition and medieval medical understanding.",
      "quotes": [
        "May it remove the swelling of my pride, clear the rot of my anger, purge the ravages of poisonous envy...",
        "when you come to live in me (who at present am only a torn sack)...",
        "touch me with the finger that pours wine, oil and purest myrrh on my wounds."

      "strengths": [
        "Vivid medical metaphors for sin and virtue.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "Some biblical references (Susanna, Dismas) are listed rather than 'painted' as scenes.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' and high precision in naming the internal states of the soul. There is a clear stewardship of language in how the preacher distinguishes between the Spirit's mercy and justice. While it uses theological terms (consubstantial, predestined, supreme pontiff), they are integrated into a prayerful flow rather than standing as dry jargon. The precision in listing specific sins (cupidity, gluttony, apathy) prevents the confession from becoming a vague platitude. The word choice is deliberate, creating a sense of 'loving language' that McEntyre advocates for, where the words themselves act as an act of devotion.",
      "quotes": [
        "It means that in one instance you manifest your mercy, and in the other your justice.",
        "for mercy and you are consubstantial.",
        "replace the infection of lust with the fragrant aromas of the most perfect continence."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "High degree of nuance in describing emotional and spiritual states.",
        "Economical use of words in the paradoxes (e.g., 'love and lover').",
        "Avoidance of empty religious filler."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The repetitive use of 'O' and 'Yes' can occasionally feel like a rhetorical crutch.",
        "The theological distinction between the two men in §1 is precise but risks becoming overly scholastic.",
        "The term 'mortal sin' is used without contextualization for a modern ear."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Theological terms like 'consubstantial' and 'predestined' are used, but they function as poetic anchors rather than academic barriers."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The text possesses a rhythmic, almost liturgical cadence. It utilizes parallelism and antithesis (labor/rest, war/peace, sorrow/happiness) to create a sense of balance and flow. The sentence structures vary effectively between short, urgent pleas ('Come, then, sweetest Spirit') and longer, flowing descriptions of divine attributes. The use of alliteration and repetition (e.g., 'calls us back... releases us... grants us grace') enhances the oral quality, making it feel like a chant or a song. This musicality serves the content by reflecting the 'harmony' the Spirit brings to the soul.",
      "quotes": [
        "repose for laborers, peace for combatants, joy for the suffering, consolation for the sick...",
        "both labor and rest begin, both war and peace, both sorrow and happiness.",
        "calls us back without upbraiding, releases us without judging, grants us grace and does not take it back."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent use of rhetorical parallelism.",
        "Strong rhythmic 'cadence' that facilitates contemplative listening.",
        "Effective use of staccato imperatives to create urgency."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The list of biblical examples in §1 is somewhat rhythmic but borders on a monotonous catalog.",
        "Some paragraphs are quite long and might benefit from more 'breathing room' in the rhythm.",
        "The ending is a bit standard in its rhythmic structure compared to the intensity of §2."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "This is clearly oral/performative language, designed for the ear and the heart rather than the eye."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of this sermon are exceptionally high, characterized by a 'sober beauty' that avoids baroque excess. The imagery is visceral and grounded in the human body and home, effectively 'showing' the Spirit's work. The language is precise, treating words as sacred instruments. The musicality, driven by medieval rhetorical devices like parallelism and antithesis, creates a meditative flow that sustains the hearer's attention. It avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by grounding theological concepts in affective experience, making the language feel both ancient and immediate."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'Homiletical Plot' of internal movement. It begins with an 'upsetting of equilibrium'—the preacher's hesitation and sense of unworthiness. This creates an immediate tension: how can a sinful human speak to/of God? The movement progresses from this initial distance to a desperate plea for healing (§2), and finally to a state of 'rest' and 'possession' (§3). The 'turning point' is the realization that the Spirit is not just an object of talk, but the subject who must speak through the preacher. While it lacks a traditional external narrative, the internal drama of the soul's 'eviction' and 'return' provides a compelling arc.",
      "quotes": [
        "I want to speak about you, and yet I hesitate, since I am not qualified.",
        "Come back, O kindly Spirit; take pity on this traitor who has driven you out.",
        "Today I see, today I understand how miserable I am, living apart from you."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong opening that establishes a 'conflict' of unworthiness.",
        "Clear movement from fragmentation (torn sack) to wholeness (dwelling in good condition).",
        "The conclusion offers a resolution that feels earned through the struggle of the prayer."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The middle section of §1 (the theological discussion of the two men) slightly stalls the narrative momentum.",
        "The transition to the final 'Amen' is somewhat abrupt.",
        "The 'plot' relies heavily on the hearer's own internal state to provide the tension."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic internal journey of the soul, moving from alienation to intimacy."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon integrates biblical examples (Peter, Paul, Mary Magdalene) not as historical artifacts but as 'reframing' devices for the preacher's own life. Cilliers' concept of reframing is present: the preacher looks at his own sin through the lens of the 'apostle to the Apostles' and the 'thief on the cross.' However, the 'contemporary context' is entirely internal/spiritual. There is little reference to the external world, which is consistent with its monastic origin but limits its 'contextual' reach in a modern sense. The integration is organic because the biblical characters are treated as 'living companions' in the struggle for grace.",
      "quotes": [
        "I remember, though, how your grace once sufficed to turn an adulterous murderer into a psalmist...",
        "Return to the house of the wretched Martha whom I have become...",
        "like the Apostle Peter: 'We have given up everything and followed you.'"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Biblical figures are used as 'mirrors' for the soul.",
        "Seamless blending of scripture quotes into the flow of the prayer.",
        "Effective 'reframing' of sin as a prelude to greater mercy."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'context' is very narrow (the interior life), lacking social or communal dimensions.",
        "The 'strangeness' of the biblical texts is somewhat smoothed over to fit the devotional theme.",
        "Could benefit from more concrete 'modern' analogies to bridge the gap for a non-monastic audience."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes, it reframes the sinner's despair as a space for the Spirit's greatest work."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "As an 'open work of art' (Stark), the sermon is successful in inviting the hearer into the 'I' of the prayer. It does not lecture; it models a relationship. However, it is 'closed' in its theological certainty regarding the Spirit's nature and the mechanics of grace. There is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' outside of the sin/grace binary. The ending is a traditional petition for eternal life, which provides closure but perhaps lacks the 'open question' that stimulates further independent reflection. It is more of a 'guided meditation' than a polyvalent exploration.",
      "quotes": [
        "speak to yourself for me and listen to yourself within me.",
        "No one experiences tranquility unless he labors for you...",
        "it will usher us into that blessed abode where we shall delight in you for all eternity."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The 'I' of the preacher is inclusive, allowing the hearer to adopt the prayer.",
        "Acknowledges the 'mystery' of why some are saved and others not.",
        "Invites participation rather than passive listening."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The theological framework is quite rigid and 'sealed.'",
        "The resolution of tension at the end is very traditional and 'safe.'",
        "Could leave more room for the 'silence' of God or the Spirit."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent in its theological direction, but open in its affective invitation."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is a well-crafted 'Homiletical Plot' of the interior life. It moves from the tension of unworthiness to the relief of divine indwelling. While it lacks a traditional three-point structure, it possesses a dramaturgical progression that mirrors the process of spiritual purgation and union. The integration of biblical examples serves to 'reframe' the individual's struggle within the grand narrative of grace. However, the structure is somewhat 'closed' by its theological certainties and its narrow focus on the internal world, leaving little room for external complexity."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids religious kitsch. It does not offer 'cheap comfort' or 'pre-chewed emotions.' Instead, it confronts the 'rot' and 'swelling' of sin with brutal honesty. The emotions feel authentic because they are tied to the 'pain of suffering' and the 'blush of shame.' It avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by acknowledging that the soul is a 'traitor' and a 'torn sack.' The beauty here is not decorative but functional—it is the 'sober beauty' of the Reformation/Devotio Moderna that Cilliers would likely appreciate as an antidote to kitsch.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The somewhat repetitive 'sweetest Spirit' and 'lovable Guest' phrases skirt the edge of sentimentalism.",
      "The idealized list of biblical 'success stories' could be seen as a simplified narrative of transformation."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the soul as a 'torn sack'—a gritty, unglamorous image.",
      "The admission of being a 'traitor' who has 'shamefully, outrageously evicted' God."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the 'surgical' precision of the imagery to ensure the 'sweetness' of the language doesn't devolve into mere sentiment."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the preacher's radical vulnerability. By admitting 'I am not qualified,' the preacher creates a vacuum that only the Spirit can fill. The sermon sustains the tension between 'miserable creature' and 'unbounded Goodness' without resolving it through human effort. However, the space is slightly constricted by a very specific dogmatic framework regarding predestination and justice, which might 'seal' the mystery for some hearers.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between the soul's poverty and God's wealth is maintained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "Partially; the 'why' of mercy is left to God, but the 'how' of grace is described quite mechanically.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; even the 'reforming' of the soul is described as something the Spirit must do.",
    "recommendation": "Allow for more 'holy unknowing' regarding the outcomes of grace to increase the sense of mystery."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is a high-quality example of 'Affective-Contemplative' aesthetics. Its primary strength lies in its 'Poetics of Language,' specifically its ability to translate abstract pneumatology into visceral, sensory experiences of healing and habitation. It avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by maintaining a sharp, almost surgical focus on the reality of sin and the necessity of divine intervention. The 'Dramaturgy of Structure' is effective as an internal journey, though it lacks the external 'contextual' hooks that would make it more 'polyvalent' in a modern, secularized setting. It creates a significant 'Space for Grace' by consistently de-centering the human 'I' and centering the Divine 'You.' The sermon is a 'sober work of art' that values precision and rhythm over baroque decoration, making it a strong model for 'stewardship of language.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Visceral, medical imagery that 'shows' the work of sanctification.",
      "Rhythmic, liturgical cadence that facilitates a meditative state.",
      "Authentic vulnerability that avoids sentimental kitsch."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Broaden the 'context' beyond the purely internal/monastic sphere.",
      "Reduce the repetitive use of affective epithets (e.g., 'sweetest').",
      "Increase 'openness' by allowing for more ambivalence or silence."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Contemplative-Affective (Devotio Moderna style)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Space for Grace' and 'Reframing' concepts of Johan Cilliers, and the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson.",
    "audience_analysis": "Most appealing to those seeking an internal, mystical, or deeply personal encounter with the Divine; less appealing to those seeking social-ethical instruction or intellectual-critical analysis.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'showing' the biblical scenes (like Susanna or the Tax Collector) in more detail.",
      "Try to connect the 'internal renovation' of the soul to the 'external renovation' of the world.",
      "Use silence or pauses as a dramaturgical tool to enhance the 'openness' of the prayer."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust piece of homiletical art. It succeeds in the 'aesthetic turn' by making the form of the prayer inseparable from its content (the indwelling of the Spirit). While its historical and liturgical context limits its 'openness' in a modern sense, its mastery of imagery and rhythm provides a compelling 'optics' for the life of faith. It is a 'sober' and 'precise' work that honors the holiness of the subject through the beauty of its language."
