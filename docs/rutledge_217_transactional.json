      "summary": "This sermon is an exceptionally healthy example of game-free communication. The preacher uses her Adult ego state to analyze both the biblical text and her own life, inviting the congregation into a similar state of self-reflection and honesty. By identifying her own 'unclean hands,' she dismantles the traditional Parent-Child hierarchy of the pulpit. The sermon avoids the 'Bait and Switch' of many Lenten sermons (which often start with grace but end with a list of 'musts'). Instead, it maintains a consistent message of unconditional acceptance, which promotes psychological autonomy and reduces the need for defensive 'games' of moral superiority.",

      "areas_for_improvement": [
        "The use of the Linda Tripp/Monica Lewinsky example, while relevant in 1999, risks inviting the 'Child' to gossip, though the preacher quickly pivots to use it as a mirror for the self."
      ],
      "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' and 'us' in a way that includes the preacher in the human condition. Maintain the focus on 'what is' (Adult) rather than 'what should be' (Critical Parent)."
