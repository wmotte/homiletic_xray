    "summary": "This sermon is a masterclass in Adult-Adult communication. Rutledge avoids the common 'Critical Parent' trap of the pulpit by identifying herself with the 'ungodly' status of the congregation. By dismantling the 'Game' of self-righteous inclusion, she promotes psychological health through reality-testing (acknowledging human limitations) and fostering a sense of authentic identity rooted in external grace rather than internal performance.",

      "High level of Adult ego engagement.",

      "Uses the 'Free Child' to bring levity to heavy theological topics."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The critique of 'inclusive' congregations could feel like a 'NIGYSOB' move to a sensitive listener.",
      "Heavy reliance on academic 'Adult' processing may exclude those who operate primarily from 'Child' or 'Parent' scripts."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue the practice of 'joining' the congregation in the pews (metaphorically) by using 'we' instead of 'you,' which maintains the Adult-Adult transaction and prevents the Drama Triangle."
