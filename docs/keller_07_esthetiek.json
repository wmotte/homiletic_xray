    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively utilizes the biblical 'temple' imagery, translating architectural metaphors into theological reality. The preacher follows Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' by expanding on the 'shekinah glory cloud' and the 'ripping of the veil.' However, the imagery is often more conceptual than sensory. While the 'stench of the pigsty' (to use the prompt's example) is absent, the preacher creates a vivid mental picture of the 'cornerstone' as a perfectly chiseled foundation stone. The use of the 'medicine' metaphor to explain 'preciousness' provides a concrete human experience to ground the abstract concept of value. The imagery serves the 'reframing' of the congregation as a building rather than just a crowd.",
      "quotes": [
        "It was characterized by the shekinah glory cloud, this cloud of glory. At night it was like fire. In the daytime it looked like a cloud.",
        "A cornerstone, first of all, has to be perfectly chiseled. Its lines have to be perfect.",
        "The building block that was rejected became the cornerstone of a whole new world."

    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably precise, adhering to Marilyn Chandler McEntyre’s 'stewardship of language.' The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by immediately defining terms like 'Bethel' or 'Shekinah.' There is a clear effort to distinguish between 'input' and 'output,' using economical language to describe complex spiritual dynamics. The precision is evident in the nuanced discussion of identity (the 'layers' of being Italian, a nurse, or a Christian). This precision prevents the sermon from sliding into vague platitudes. Every word seems chosen to build a logical case, reflecting a high degree of 'language care' that respects the intellect of the urban hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s a word that means to be fitted together—a spiritual house, a house of the Holy Spirit.",
        "You’re a Christian first and you’re everything else second. You’re a Christian first and you’re an abused child second.",
        "The imagery of the living stones being built into a single unit implies the significance and purpose of individual Christians cannot be realized apart from community."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent definition of theological terms for a secular/pluralistic context.",
        "Nuanced handling of sensitive topics like race and identity.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "Reduce the use of 'filler' phrases like 'Let me give you an example' or 'What does that mean?'.",
        "Occasionally, the language becomes slightly academic (e.g., 'episodically', 'operable foundation').",
        "More poetic variation in the 'input/output' section would soften the functionalist tone."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Theological jargon is present but always systematically 'unpacked' and translated into common vernacular."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is clearly designed for oral delivery, but it favors a 'teaching' cadence over a 'poetic' one. There is a repetitive rhythm in the 'What we are called to be/do' structure which aids memorability (rhetorical parallelism). However, the sentence structure often feels like 'prose' rather than 'poetry.' It lacks the staccato/legato variation that Grözinger advocates for. The musicality is found in the 'call and response' nature of the preacher's rhetorical questions. It is effective 'oral language,' but it rarely rises to the level of aesthetic beauty in its sound value, remaining largely functional and didactic.",
      "quotes": [
        "We don’t want the presence of God and we can’t bear the presence of God and we don’t deserve the presence of God.",
        "There’s not a sin in your past that can’t be cleansed. There’s not a wound that can’t be healed. There’s not a bad habit that can’t be broken.",
        "The building block that was rejected / Became the cornerstone of a whole new world."

        "Effective use of tricolons (three-fold repetitions) for emphasis.",
        "Natural conversational flow that avoids 'paper language' stiffness.",
        "Strong use of rhetorical questions to drive the internal dialogue of the hearer."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Incorporate more varied sentence lengths to create dramatic tension.",
        "Use more alliteration or assonance to make key phrases 'sticky.'",
        "The transition between points is somewhat 'bureaucratic' (e.g., 'Let’s break that down')."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Distinctly oral language; the transcript captures a spontaneous, communicative event."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by 'sober beauty' and intellectual precision. While it lacks the high-poetic lyricism of some traditions, it excels in the 'stewardship of words' by making complex biblical concepts accessible without diluting them. The imagery is robust and serves as a 'lens' for the hearer to see themselves as part of a larger spiritual architecture. The musicality is functional, relying on rhetorical repetition rather than poetic meter, ensuring the message is 'heard' and 'understood' in a didactic sense."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium'—challenging the notion that Christianity is just a 'New Year's resolution.' It moves through the 'complication' of the lost presence of God in Eden to the 'climax' of the ripped veil in Christ. The movement from 'What we are' to 'What we do' creates a logical progression. However, the structure is a traditional 'three-point' model, which can feel static. The 'turning point' is the theological shift from the Old Testament 'confined' holiness to the New Testament 'breakout' holiness. Energy is sustained by the personal challenge regarding the church's transition.",
      "quotes": [
        "To live a Christian life is way more than just turning over a new leaf... it’s much more transformative and radical than that.",
        "The very thing we were built for we can’t bear. We can’t bear the presence of God.",
        "Redeemer in the past has been one big central church... We are transitioning into being multiple churches."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear movement from biblical history to contemporary ecclesiology.",
        "The 'presence of God' theme provides a strong narrative thread.",
        "The conclusion links the 'cornerstone' back to the 'whole new world,' providing a satisfying resolution."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'three headings' are announced too early, which can reduce the sense of discovery.",
        "The transition between point 2 and 3 feels slightly abrupt.",
        "The 'upsetting' at the start could be more provocative to grab attention faster."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey disguised as a three-point structure; the internal logic moves from problem to solution."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong example of Cilliers' 'reframing.' The preacher takes the ancient 'temple' and 'priesthood' categories and reframes the modern New Yorker’s life within them. The integration is organic; the 'living stones' metaphor is used to address the specific 'context' of urban isolation and the consumerist approach to church. The 'reframing' of identity (race/profession vs. Christ) is a masterful synthesis of the 1 Peter text with the sociological realities of a global city. It honors the 'strangeness' of the biblical text (the pots in Zechariah) while making it startlingly relevant.",
      "quotes": [
        "You didn’t get to be the mess you were all by yourself... it was through relationships. Therefore, it makes perfect sense that God would... change you as you come into the church.",
        "If you live in New York City, if you’re coming to Redeemer... you’re not here by accident.",
        "You’re a Christian first and you’re Asian or Hispanic or African second."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Deep contextualization for an urban, professional, and multi-ethnic audience.",
        "The 'reframing' of the sermon from a 'product to consume' to a 'participation' is aesthetically and practically powerful.",
        "Honors the 'weirdness' of Zechariah to illustrate a profound theological point."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could include more specific 'New York' vignettes to ground the context even further.",
        "The connection to the 'books of 1 and 2 Peter' as a series could be more integrated into the specific message.",
        "Address the 'resistance' (Stark) of the secular hearer more directly in the reframing."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing present: reality is viewed through the lens of the 'Temple of the Spirit' rather than 'Individual Achievement.'"
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is somewhat 'closed' in its logical structure—it seeks to 'unpack' and 'explain' rather than leave the hearer in the mystery. However, it remains an 'open work of art' (Stark) in its application. By emphasizing that 'only you can reach' certain people, it invites the hearer to find their own meaning and role. The ending is an invitation ('Don't you want to be part of that?') rather than a coercive command. It acknowledges the 'ambivalence' of being hurt by the church, yet it pushes toward a specific interpretation of the text. It is more 'didactic' than 'polyvalent.'",
      "quotes": [
        "There are some needs only you can see. There are some hands only you can hold.",
        "I understand it... big churches have talented staff... It’s natural to say, 'You don’t really need my money.'",
        "Don’t you want to be part of that? I do. Let us pray."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The invitation to 'priesthood' is empowering rather than moralistic.",
        "Acknowledges the difficulty of community ('I’ve been hurt in the past').",
        "The 'open' ending regarding the future of the church allows for congregational agency."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Leave more 'unanswered' questions to stimulate mid-week reflection.",
        "The 'three ways to relate' can feel like a closed system of truth.",
        "Allow for more 'mystery' regarding the presence of God rather than explaining it all through 'glory clouds.'"
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent in its teaching, but open in its vocational invitation."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are characterized by a strong, logical 'dramaturgy of persuasion.' The sermon moves the hearer from an individualistic understanding of faith to a communal, 'priestly' identity. The integration of the biblical 'temple' narrative with the contemporary 'urban' narrative is the sermon's greatest structural strength. While the three-point structure is traditional, the internal movement is dynamic, leading to a 'climax' in the person of Christ as the cornerstone. It creates a 'space' where the hearer is invited to see their city and their church through a new, grace-filled frame."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully avoids religious kitsch. It does not offer 'cheap comfort' or 'pre-chewed emotions.' Instead, it confronts the 'brokenness' of the world (disease, injustice, violence) and the 'mess' of human relationships. The preacher avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by acknowledging that the church is 'flawed' and that the hearer might be 'timid' or 'selfish.' The emotion is authentic because it is grounded in the 'rejection' of Christ. By sustaining the tension of 'not yet' seeing God face-to-face, it avoids the 'immediate gratification' typical of kitsch.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential for kitsch in the 'New Year's resolution' comparison is quickly subverted by the 'radical' nature of the gospel.",
      "The 'medicine' analogy could border on kitsch if not for the emphasis on the 'cost' (selling the house)."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The honest admission that 'we don't want the presence of God' and 'we can't bear it.'",
      "The acknowledgment of being 'hurt in the past' by the church."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of intellectual honesty; continue to ground 'glory' in the 'rejection' of the cross to prevent aesthetic sentimentality."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened primarily through the 'Reframing' of identity. By moving the 'foundation' from human performance (being a lawyer, being 'white', etc.) to the 'preciousness' of Christ, the preacher creates a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers). However, the 'output' section risks becoming moralistic ('you must volunteer'). The preacher mitigates this by grounding the 'doing' in the 'being' (priesthood). The 'mystery' of the Holy Spirit is respected, though the systematic explanation of 'how it works' slightly closes the space that wonder might occupy.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'already' (partakers of divine nature) and 'not yet' (seeing face-to-face) is well-sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of God's presence is explained through biblical history, which provides clarity but reduces the 'ineffable' quality of the Holy.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails as the foundation, though the call to 'output' leans toward a soft imperative.",
    "recommendation": "To create more space, allow the 'wonder' of the ripped veil to sit longer before moving to the 'application' of church volunteering."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high-quality example of 'Sober-Reformed' aesthetics, where the beauty lies in the clarity of thought and the 'reframing' of reality. It avoids the visual and emotional excess of 'kitsch' in favor of an 'aesthetic of the word' that respects the hearer's intellect. The poetics are precise and the structure is a well-crafted 'dramaturgy of persuasion.' Its greatest aesthetic achievement is the synthesis of ancient temple imagery with the modern struggle for identity and community in a global city. While it leans toward the didactic, it successfully creates a 'space for grace' by grounding human vocation in the 'preciousness' of Christ rather than the effort of the believer.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Intellectual precision and 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre).",
      "Effective 'reframing' of identity and community (Cilliers).",
      "Authentic, anti-kitsch approach to the 'presence of God' and human brokenness."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase sensory imagery ('show, don't tell') to move beyond conceptual beauty.",
      "Vary the rhetorical rhythm to move from 'teaching' to 'poetic' resonance.",
      "Soften the 'three-point' structure to allow for more narrative discovery."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Intellectual-Contextual",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Witness' model of Thomas Long.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to urban professionals, skeptics, and 'thinking' Christians who value logic and contextual relevance over emotionalism.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more narrative 'Lowry Loop' structure to increase dramatic tension.",
      "Incorporate a 'lament' section to deepen the contrast before the 'glory' breakout.",
      "Use one central, recurring sensory image (e.g., the 'pot' or the 'stone') throughout the entire sermon."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust 'open work' that invites the hearer into a new perception of their life and city. It excels in 'language care' and 'reframing,' providing a clear alternative to religious kitsch. While it could benefit from more poetic 'musicality' and sensory 'showing,' its clarity and theological depth create a compelling 'event' where the 'holy happens' through the medium of precise, contextualized proclamation."
