    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively utilizes the 'temple' and 'stone' imagery inherent in the Petrine text. It succeeds in 'showing' rather than just 'telling' by tracing the biblical-theological trajectory of God's presence from Eden to the shekinah glory cloud. The preacher uses concrete sensory markers like 'fire by night' and 'stench of the pigsty' (implied in the prodigal-like descriptions) to ground abstract concepts of holiness. However, the imagery remains largely biblical-historical rather than contemporary-metaphorical. While the 'medicine' illustration is a strong, fresh metaphor for preciousness, many other images are traditional tropes. The 'living stone' metaphor is explained conceptually more than it is evoked sensorially, though the 'fitted together' aspect is given a tactile, relational dimension.",
      "quotes": [
        "It was characterized by the shekinah glory cloud, this cloud of glory. At night it was like fire. In the daytime it looked like a cloud.",
        "On that day ‘holy to the Lord’ will be inscribed on the bells of the horses and on every pot in Jerusalem.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise, characteristic of 'stewardship of language.' The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by immediately unpacking terms like 'shekinah,' 'tabernacle,' and 'cornerstone.' There is a clear effort to define the 'layers of identity,' using the preacher's own family history (Italian immigrant, nurse) to provide a nuanced, non-clichéd explanation of what it means for Christ to be a 'foundation.' The vocabulary is accessible yet intellectually rigorous, doing justice to the complexity of the 'already/not yet' tension in the text. The distinction between 'input' and 'output' provides a clear, non-jargonistic framework for spiritual health.",

        "The cornerstone wasn’t just any stone. It was the foundation of the foundation.",

        "The transition to the 'Redeemer' specific context is slightly bureaucratic compared to the earlier poetic sections."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "The sermon is a model for 'jargon-breaking.' It takes high-level theological terms and translates them into psychological and sociological realities."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is clearly designed for oral delivery, featuring a conversational cadence and a pedagogical rhythm. It uses 'staccato' sentences for emphasis ('Everything broke. But God decided not to leave us in this.') and 'legato' passages for narrative flow. However, it lacks a high degree of poetic musicality or rhetorical flourish. The structure is more 'teaching-oriented' than 'lyrical.' The rhythm is predictable—question, answer, illustration—which aids clarity but limits the aesthetic 'flow' that characterizes more contemplative or celebratory preaching. It is 'oral language' but not necessarily 'poetic language.'",
      "quotes": [
        "We don’t want the presence of God and we can’t bear the presence of God and we don’t deserve the presence of God.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by 'sober beauty' and clarity. While it avoids high-flown lyricism, it excels in the stewardship of language by translating ancient temple imagery into modern psychological and relational categories. The imagery is strong where it traces the biblical narrative, though it occasionally relies on familiar tropes. The musicality is functional—designed for teaching—rather than poetic. It is a 'plain style' that achieves aesthetic depth through precision and the removal of religious obscurities, creating a transparent window into the text."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' as described by Lowry. It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium'—challenging the notion that Christianity is just a 'New Year's resolution'—and introduces the 'problem' of God's presence being unbearable to broken humans. The movement from the Garden of Eden to the Tabernacle and finally to Christ provides a narrative momentum. The 'turning point' is the tearing of the veil, which shifts the sermon from 'what we lost' to 'what we have.' However, the three-point structure (What we are, what we do, how we are enabled) is somewhat static and academic, which can occasionally stall the narrative energy.",
      "quotes": [
        "To live a Christian life is way more than just turning over a new leaf... No, it’s much more transformative and radical than that.",
        "When Jesus Christ died on the cross, the veil in the temple was ripped from top to bottom.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength of the sermon. The preacher 'reframes' the ancient temple architecture (stones, cornerstones, priests) into the context of a modern, individualistic New York City. The synthesis is organic: the 'fitted together' aspect of the temple is used to critique the 'privacy of your own apartment' spirituality of modern urbanites. The 'reframing' of identity—placing Christ as the 'uttermost foundation' beneath race, career, and trauma—is a masterful aesthetic move that makes the ancient text feel urgently contemporary. It respects the 'strangeness' of the Old Testament while making it operative for the hearer.",

        "Lord, now I have a relationship with you, just change me in the privacy of my own apartment, please.",

      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing present: the temple is no longer a building, but a community that challenges the hearer's self-constructed identity."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward a 'closed' structure in its pedagogical clarity, but remains 'open' in its invitation. While the theological points are neatly resolved (typical of the Reformed tradition), the sermon leaves the hearer with an open-ended call to 'output' and 'participation.' It avoids 'kitsch' happy endings by acknowledging the 'brokenness' of the world and the church. However, the preacher acts more as a 'teacher' than a 'witness' (Long), which can feel authoritative and 'sealed.' The polyvalence is limited; there is a very specific 'correct' way to interpret the text presented here. The 'openness' comes from the invitation to join a 'whole new world.'",
      "quotes": [
        "What does that actually mean? It means two things, and we’re only going to look at the second one.",
        "If you’re only doing input... it’s bad for you. It’s bad for the church. It’s bad for the city.",
        "Don’t you want to be part of that? I do. Let us pray."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The ending is an invitation rather than a command, leaving space for the hearer to respond.",

        "Allow more room for 'resistance' or 'ambivalence'—why might someone *not* want to be a living stone?",
        "Reduce the 'let me unpack that' teacher-talk to allow the text to speak more evocatively.",
        "End with a more contemplative question that stays with the hearer throughout the week."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily a 'closed' pedagogical work, but with an 'open' existential invitation at the end."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are characterized by a strong redemptive-historical arc and masterful integration of text and context. The sermon moves from the 'trouble' of lost presence to the 'grace' of the cornerstone. While the three-point structure is somewhat traditional and 'closed,' the preacher uses it to 'reframe' modern identity and community. The dramaturgy is effective in taking the hearer on a journey from the Garden of Eden to the New Jerusalem, making the local church's transition feel like a participation in a cosmic drama."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'pre-chewed' emotions and 'happy ending' clichés. Instead of offering immediate comfort, it takes the 'pain of suffering' and the 'brokenness' of the world seriously. The 'medicine' illustration is an authentic emotional appeal because it is grounded in the gravity of a death sentence. The preacher does not 'beautify' the church, calling it a 'mess' and acknowledging that people have been 'hurt in the past.' This honesty prevents the sermon from becoming a manipulative 'kitsch' advertisement for church membership. The focus on 'rejection' (Christ's and the stones') provides an aesthetic depth that sustains tension.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'New Year's resolution' comparison is a bit of a cliché, though used here as a foil to be rejected.",
      "The 'cute little call and response' mention at the end borders on sentimentality, but is rescued by the cosmic scope of the lyrics."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'uttermost foundation' where one wrestles with demonic monsters (Balrog) as a metaphor for the heart.",
      "The admission that 'the church is so flawed' and that community is 'pressing' and difficult."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'sober' approach to the gospel; avoid the 'cute' song references in the climax to keep the aesthetic weight on the 'rejected stone' imagery."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'vertical' dimension of Christ as the cornerstone. By emphasizing that we are 'being built' (passive) and that Christ was 'rejected for us,' the sermon moves away from pure moralism. However, the heavy emphasis on 'output' and the 'priesthood of all believers' as a task for the hearer risks closing that space with a new 'law' of church involvement. The preacher balances this by grounding the 'doing' in the 'seeing' (being precious to Him). The 'Space for Grace' is most palpable in the section on Christ's rejection, where the mystery of the cross is presented as the source of power.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between 'already' (partaking of divine nature) and 'not yet' (walking by faith) are well-sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of God's presence is respected, though the 'teacher' persona tends to explain things thoroughly.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the 'foundation' section, but moralization (the 'need' for the hearer to serve) becomes prominent in the 'output' section.",
    "recommendation": "To create more space, emphasize the 'rest' of being a stone in the temple before moving to the 'work' of the priest."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7,
    "summary": "The sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'Reformed Sober Beauty.' Its power lies not in poetic excess or emotional manipulation, but in the precision of its language and the 'reframing' of its structure. The preacher acts as a 'steward of the word,' carefully deconstructing ancient temple imagery to address the deep-seated identity crises of a modern urban audience. The aesthetic experience is one of 'clarity' and 'insight'—the hearer is led to *see* the biblical narrative as their own story. While the structure is somewhat pedagogical and 'closed,' the authentic handling of human brokenness and the cosmic scope of the conclusion provide significant aesthetic depth. It avoids religious kitsch by refusing to offer easy solutions, instead pointing to the 'rejected stone' as the only viable foundation for a 'whole new world.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of ancient temple imagery for a modern individualistic context.",
      "Exceptional 'stewardship of language'—precise, jargon-free, and intellectually engaging.",
      "Authentic, anti-kitsch approach to the 'messiness' of church and the gravity of the gospel."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase the 'musicality' and poetic flow of the language to move beyond a 'teaching' tone.",
      "Create more 'openness' by allowing for more ambivalence and mystery in the application.",
      "Balance the 'output' (task) section with more 'space for grace' (rest/gift)."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Academic-Declarative with Narrative-Reframing elements.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Form follows Text' of Thomas Long, with a strong emphasis on 'Imagery' as advocated by Paul Scott Wilson.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals most to 'urban intellectuals' and 'seekers' who value clarity, logical coherence, and the deconstruction of religious clichés.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'witness-oriented' stance to increase the 'event' quality of the sermon.",
      "Use more 'showing' in the contemporary application, not just in the biblical history.",
      "Incorporate a moment of 'liturgical silence' or a more poetic crescendo to open more space for the Holy."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is an aesthetically effective 'open work' in its invitation, despite its 'closed' pedagogical structure. It succeeds in making the 'Holy happen' through the clarity of the Word. It is a model of how to use 'sober beauty' to reach a skeptical, modern audience without sacrificing theological depth. The aesthetic of 'reframing' is its greatest achievement, turning a 2000-year-old text into a mirror for the modern soul."
