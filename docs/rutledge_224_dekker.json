Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! AMEN."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "While the sermon quotes Romans 7, it immediately pivots to a popular Internet anecdote (the two wolves). The specificity of Romans 7—the unique tension between the 'I' and the 'Law'—is replaced by a general moral dualism found in many cultures. It fails to identify what is in this passage that can be found nowhere else.",
      "quotes": [
        "The story I am going to tell is all over the Internet... An old Cherokee is instructing his young son.",
        "Two wolves, the law of God and the law of sin."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Discard the 'two wolves' analogy as the primary lens. Focus instead on the specific Pauline 'ego' and the theological function of the Law which exposes sin, rather than a psychological dualism."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of linguistic study (Hebrew/Greek) or historical-critical engagement. The preacher treats the text as a mirror for a modern psychological predicament without explaining Paul's specific theological argument regarding the Torah or the transition from the old age to the new.",
      "quotes": [
        "St. Paul describes this conflict that goes on in every soul"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explain the context of Romans 7 within Paul's argument about the Law's inability to save, despite its holiness, and the specific 'body of death' imagery in its Roman context."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application attempts concreteness by mentioning the movie 'Crash' and national politics. However, it quickly reverts to general moral categories (stingy, slothful, arrogant). It lacks the 'broad knowledge of the humanities' Dekker requires to truly dissect the zeitgeist.",
      "quotes": [
        "America has two wolves fighting for dominance. The good America is open, generous, and free. The ugly America is arrogant, bullying, triumphalist."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond moralistic dualism (good vs. ugly) to a more profound analysis of how the 'law of sin' manifests in specific contemporary structures of power or psychological despair."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is more of a thematic speech than an exposition. The text is used to validate the 'two wolves' story rather than the text 'expounding' the hearer. The movement is from anecdote to text, rather than the Word recreating the present.",
      "quotes": [
        "The story I am going to tell... St. Paul describes this conflict... the Oscar-winning movie Crash illustrates this"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Allow the biblical text to set the categories of the sermon rather than using external stories as the primary framework."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon strongly emphasizes 'misery' (incapacity of the human spirit) and 'redemption' (Christ as the Good Shepherd). It correctly identifies that man has no power to help himself. However, 'gratitude' is barely addressed as a lived response.",
      "quotes": [
        "we have no power of ourselves to help ourselves.",
        "Wretched human being that I am! Who will deliver me...?"
      ],

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon acknowledges the possibility of being 'lost' or 'captive,' and it critiques the 'triumph of the human spirit.' However, the 'two ways' are presented more as a struggle of natures than a radical call to decision before God.",
      "quotes": [
        "Which wolf will win?",
        "Left to ourselves, we will feed the carnivorous wolf every time."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'destination' more explicit. What is the 'destruction' Paul speaks of, and how does the 'narrow way' look in the face of the 'body of death'?"
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos and the deliverer. The sermon correctly points to salvation outside of the self. However, the transition to Christ feels somewhat abrupt and 'dogmatically' applied rather than arising from the specific 'wretched man' cry of the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "we have been delivered by the self-offering of the Good Shepherd",
        "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the person of Christ more deeply to the specific 'law' that Paul is struggling with, rather than switching to the 'Good Shepherd' imagery from a different Gospel context."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 1,
      "findings": "The sermon is approximately 7-8 minutes long. According to Dekker's Thesis 8, this is fundamentally insufficient for the 'breadth' required for theological depth. It is a 'speech,' not a 'sermon' by his definition.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have been told that I have only eight minutes to speak to you this morning."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must demand or take the time necessary (at least 20 minutes) to allow the Word to truly unfold and the exegesis to breathe."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text falls short of being a sermon in Dekker's sense, primarily due to its brevity and its reliance on a general cultural anecdote rather than specific scriptural exposition. It functions as a moral-theological speech. While it correctly identifies human misery and the necessity of external grace, it lacks the exegetical rigor and the 'breadth' required for true homiletical depth.",
    "strengths": [
      "Clear rejection of Pelagianism and the 'triumph of the human spirit'.",
      "Adequate identification of the 'extra nos' (outside ourselves) nature of salvation in Christ.",
      "Direct and sober tone that avoids sentimentality."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Duration is far below the 20-minute threshold for depth.",
      "The 'two wolves' story overshadows the specific theological logic of Romans 7.",
      "Total absence of original language engagement or historical context."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon; it is a brief meditation or 'speech about the gospel.' It fails the formal criteria of exposition and the requirement of length, resulting in a lack of the specific 'current, proclamatory word' that only a deep engagement with the text can produce."
