While the social critique is intellectually sharp (Adult), the delivery method invites the listener into a shamed Adapted Child state. The binary 'either/or' structure limits the listener's Adult capacity to find nuanced, autonomous ways to live faithfully within their context, instead offering a 'compliance or destruction' ultimatum.",
