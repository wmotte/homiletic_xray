  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to address the specific point of the text. The passage in Matthew is about the resurrection of the dead and the nature of God as the God of the living. The preacher ignores the resurrection entirely and turns the text into a general discourse on God's inclusivity of different personality types. This is not 'recreating the Bible into a new, current, proclamatory word' but using a text as a peg for a pre-conceived idea.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus quotes God as saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob.' ... though this was not particularly the point he was making."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus on the specific theological claim of the text: why does the mention of the patriarchs prove the resurrection? What is unique about God's relationship to the dead that makes them 'living'?"
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of academic exegesis or knowledge of the original context (the Sadducees' challenge). The preacher treats the names of the patriarchs as character studies rather than a covenantal argument. The 'exposition' is reduced to psychological profiles of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that are largely speculative and moralistic.",
      "quotes": [
        "Abraham was a great and towering figure. He dreamed in the quiet land of Ur...",
        "Isaac was a very ordinary figure and very commonplace."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Study the Sadducean context of the question and the specific logic of the Pentateuchal citation used by Jesus."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "While the application is concrete (mentioning 'Tom', the Civil Rights movement, and 'school closers'), it is detached from the actual meaning of the text. The application becomes a series of general truths about self-worth and social justice rather than an application of the Word of God as found in Matthew 22.",
      "quotes": [
        "Those who would change the ways and acts of our democracy need not feel that they must do this without God.",
        "The most ordinary person is important to God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect contemporary struggles (like the Civil Rights movement mentioned) to the hope of the resurrection and God's power over death, rather than just 'God is on our side'."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exposition and application are mixed, but because the exposition is faulty, the interwoven result is a thematic speech rather than a sermon. The hearer is drawn into a 'zeitgeist' (Civil Rights, personal success/failure) but not into the biblical text itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "So God is the God of dreamers of big dreams and those men and women who are not willing to drift with the tide..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Let the application flow from the specific 'strangeness' of the text rather than from general psychological categories."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on misery (Tom's conscience, Jacob's cheating) and redemption (God's love), but it is overly optimistic and human-centered. Misery is treated as 'feeling bad' or 'falling by the way' rather than a state before God. Redemption is presented as God's 'need' for man, which contradicts the sovereignty of grace.",
      "quotes": [
        "There is an emptiness in God's heart that only you can fill.",
        "He said, 'I am coming back. I've got a conscience, and I know I've been wrong.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Reframe misery not as a psychological 'stricken conscience' but as the reality of death and sin which only the 'God of the living' can overcome."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The sermon explicitly denies the possibility of being lost. It suggests that God 'couldn't care more' regardless of the record, which, while sounding like grace, removes the seriousness of the 'two ways'. The warning to 'Jacob' is softened by the assurance that he can always start over by his own will.",
      "quotes": [
        "No matter who you are or what you have done... I couldn't care more.",
        "You've cheated and lied and stolen, and you wonder whether you can ever get near to God. Jacob would tell you that you most assuredly can."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'grapes of wrath' mentioned in the hymn more seriously; show that the choice for or against the God of the living has eternal consequences."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as a historical figure who gathered disciples, but He is not the telos of the sermon. The sermon ends with man's importance to God rather than Christ as the life of man. The 'one Lord' is replaced by the 'important individual'.",
      "quotes": [
        "When Jesus gathered his disciples, there were some whose names you hear often...",
        "It's your place in God's heart, and only you can fill it."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make Christ the center of the resurrection hope. Show how Christ is the 'God of the living' in His own person."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 14 minutes, the sermon is too short according to Dekker's 20-minute rule. It lacks the 'breadth' required for theological depth, opting instead for anecdotes and illustrations.",
      "improvement_point": "Increase the duration by engaging in rigorous theological exposition of the text's core claims about life, death, and resurrection."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls significantly short of Dekker’s criteria. It fails the formal definition by ignoring the specific content of the Bible passage (the resurrection) in favor of a general thematic speech about God's acceptance of different personalities. It lacks rigorous exegesis and fails to establish Christ as the telos, focusing instead on human potential and psychological comfort.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete contemporary references (Civil Rights, specific social figures) provide a sense of current relevance.",
      "The language is accessible and avoids overly dense jargon, attempting to speak to the 'man in the street'."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Theological 'eisegesis': the preacher forces a 'personality type' theme onto a text about the resurrection.",
      "Anthropocentric conclusion: claiming God has an 'emptiness' that only humans can fill reverses the biblical order of grace.",
      "Lack of 'Two Ways': the sermon presents a universalism that removes the urgency of repentance and the seriousness of God's judgment."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the Dekkerian sense; it is a moralistic-therapeutic speech. It fails to actualize the specific Word of God and instead offers general truths that could be found elsewhere in the Bible or even in secular humanism."
