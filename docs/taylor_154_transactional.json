    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of Parent-Child homiletics. While it contains beautiful imagery and genuine empathy for the elderly, it relies heavily on shaming (Critical Parent) to motivate 'maturity.' It creates a psychological environment where the listener is made to feel small and incompetent ('shivering,' 'left-backs') so that the theological solution ('everlasting arms') feels more necessary. This reinforces dependency rather than Adult autonomy.",

      "Reduction of shaming language ('laughingstock', 'whimpering').",
      "Engagement of the listener's Adult ego by asking reflective questions rather than prescribing labels."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as Adult-to-Adult. Instead of telling them they are 'shivering' or 'foolish,' present the challenges of aging as objective realities and invite them to decide how they will respond based on their own faith and values."
