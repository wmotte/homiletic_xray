  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to treat the Bible passage as a unique word. Instead of exploring what Acts 1:8 says that can be found nowhere else, the preacher uses the text as a coat rack for a biographical and political discourse on Oscar Romero. The text is a 'biblical keyword' (witness) rather than a specific revelation.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ich will zwei Gedanken aus diesem Text entfalten: 1. Die Toten sind nicht tot. 2. Auch wir werden Zeugen sein."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the specific tension in Acts 1:8 regarding the movement from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth as a divine necessity, rather than equating it immediately with modern political geography."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of linguistic study (Greek) or historical-theological context of the Lucan work. The 'first readers' are ignored. The preacher bypasses the original meaning of 'witness' in the context of the apostolic office and the ascension, jumping straight to modern revolutionary figures.",
      "quotes": [
        "Der Text zu unserem Gottesdienst steht in der Apostelgeschichte..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explain the theological significance of the 'power of the Holy Spirit' in the context of the early church's mission and the specific role of the apostles as eyewitnesses of the resurrection."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the political situation in El Salvador and mentions specific German locations. However, it leans toward 'general truths' about justice and the poor, which Dekker warns against if they become ideological slogans.",
      "quotes": [
        "...warum dann nicht auch in Hamburg-Altona, in Brockdorf und in Brunsbüttel?",
        "Er zieht uns in den großen Bekehrungsprozess hinein, der heute von den Armen zu den Reichen... geht."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the application more strictly to the 'power of the Spirit' rather than just political 'courage and truth-ability'."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Exposition and application are not mixed because exposition is largely absent. The sermon is almost entirely application (biography and politics) with the Bible text serving only as a decorative frame.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wie Oscar Romero, so auch wir. Wie Jesus, so auch wir."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Allow the text to 'expound' the hearer. Instead of bringing Romero to the text, let the text judge both Romero and the congregation."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Misery is present (poverty, murder), but it is primarily socio-political misery, not 'misery before God.' Redemption is equated with political awakening and 'learning from the poor.' The Trinitarian background is thin; the Spirit is reduced to human 'courage'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Was ist die Kraft des Geistes? Nach alter Lehre zweierlei: Mut und Wahrheitsfähigkeit."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the concept of misery to include the spiritual lostness that necessitates the 'power from on high' mentioned in the text."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are present in the form of 'temporal loss' (society perishing through injustice). However, the 'eternal loss' is absent. The sermon suggests a collective movement of conversion but lacks the individual urgency Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "...viele andere, die die Realität nicht wahrhaben wollen.",
        "Es gibt keinen Ort in der Welt, der zu finster wäre..."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned, but He is not the 'telos.' He is a model ('Wie Jesus, so auch wir'). The sermon is more 'Romerocentric' than Christocentric. Grace is not the 'deepest of life' here; rather, human action and 'truth-ability' are central.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wie Jesus, so auch wir.",
        "Er [Romero] organisiert uns, will sagen, er bekehrt uns."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "With an estimated duration of less than 7 minutes, the sermon fails Dekker's requirement for 'breadth' to achieve 'depth.' It is a short address or meditation, not a sermon.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the sermon to at least 20 minutes by engaging in serious exegetical labor and deeper dogmatic reflection."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text falls significantly short of Dekker's definition of a sermon. It lacks formal exegesis, ignores the original context of the Bible passage, and is far too short to provide the necessary depth. It functions as a political-biographical speech rather than the 'recreation of the Bible into a new, current, proclamatory word.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete contemporary references (Hamburg, Brockdorf, El Salvador).",
      "Avoids making the 'witnesses' (saints) unreachably perfect by mentioning Romero's mistakes."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Total lack of Hebrew/Greek or historical-critical engagement.",
      "Theologically reductive: the Holy Spirit is reduced to human psychological traits (courage).",
      "Duration is insufficient for a substantive sermon.",
      "The Bible text is a pretext for a lecture on Liberation Theology."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker’s theses. It is a speech about 'the prophet Romero' and 'justice,' which Dekker explicitly categorizes as 'not a sermon.' It lacks the specific 'NOWHERE else' quality of the biblical text."
