It is characterized by significant intellectual depth and a strong grasp of biblical theology, particularly in its synthesis of the 'recapitulation' theme and the linguistic nuances of 'righteousness'. However, it fails to complete the Kolb cycle, as it provides almost no concrete application for the individual hearer. The 'Active Experimentation' phase is relegated to general suggestions for liturgical reform rather than personal ethical or spiritual response. Consequently, while the 'Assimilating' learner will be highly satisfied, the 'Accommodating' and 'Converging' learners will likely find the sermon too abstract and detached from daily reality.

It succeeds in its 'Normative' task (Osmer) by clearly articulating the biblical vision of Christ's baptism. However, from a Kolb perspective, it is an incomplete learning cycle. The lack of 'Active Experimentation' and 'Concrete Experience' creates a gap between the 'glory of Christ' and the 'life of the hearer'. To move from a 5.2 to a higher score, the preacher must bridge the chasm between the 'cosmic' victory of Christ and the 'individual' struggle of the parishioner, moving from a lecture on 'recapitulation' to a guide for 'walking in newness of life'."
