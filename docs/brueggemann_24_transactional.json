    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative games. It utilizes the Free Child to spark imagination and the Adult to provide a structure for ethical change. By acknowledging the 'outrageous' nature of the gospel, the preacher validates the listener's reality-testing (Adult) rather than demanding blind faith (Adapted Child). The transition from the 'Nurturing Parent' vision of Isaiah to the 'Critical Parent' demand of John is handled with transparency, preventing a 'Bait and Switch' game.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of transparency regarding the difficulty of belief.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The list of 'Decreases' could potentially trigger an Adapted Child response if the listener feels overwhelmed by the 'musts'.",
      "Slight risk of 'Ain't it Awful' in the description of 'taxed out of homes' and 'rapacious seizure,' though it is grounded in the biblical text."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize the 'willing' nature of the response. Ensure that the 'demanding work' is always framed as an empowering choice (Adult) rather than a survival requirement (Adapted Child)."
