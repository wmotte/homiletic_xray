    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a recognizable situation regarding end-of-year giving and Christmas. However, it lacks a deep narrative 'hook' that allows the hearer to feel the tension of the rich young ruler's encounter. The experience is more intellectualized than felt. The preacher identifies the 'New York' context of young wealth, which aids identification, but the emotional connection remains secondary to the logical progression.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher spends significant time exploring the 'why' and 'how' of money’s danger. He utilizes psychological insights (addiction, denial, false security) to help the hearer observe their own condition. He pauses to challenge cultural assumptions, such as the difference between modern and first-century views of the rich.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The theological exposition is clear and systematic. The preacher explains the 'Big Idea'—that money magnifies the universal human problem of self-salvation. He provides a solid exegesis of the 'camel and needle' metaphor and connects the passage to the broader biblical theology of grace vs. works (Pharisee and Tax Collector). The logic is deductive and structured.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon concludes with concrete guidelines (the 10% rule and the 'sacrifice' principle). However, it stops short of providing specific 'how-to' steps for implementation in a complex financial life. The call to action is clear but remains somewhat at the level of 'principle' rather than 'practice'.",
      "quotes": [
        "What percentage of your money should you give away to ministry, charity, and the poor? In the Old Testament, it was a minimum of 10 percent.",

    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of a Declarative-Reflective approach. It falls short in providing a truly immersive Concrete Experience, opting instead for a topical introduction. The strength lies in its 'Reflective Observation'—the preacher masterfully uses psychological and cultural analysis to expose the hearer's heart. The 'Abstract Conceptualization' is robust, providing a clear Christocentric framework. The 'Active Experimentation' is present but somewhat generic, relying on traditional 'rules of thumb' rather than innovative practical steps. The sermon effectively addresses the 'Assimilating' learner but may leave the 'Accommodating' learner wanting more narrative and immediate action.",

      "Increase the Pragmatic score by providing a 'case study' of a concrete giving decision.",
      "Incorporate more 'Narrative' elements throughout the body of the sermon."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a well-crafted, intellectually stimulating piece of homiletics that excels in the 'Reflective Observation' phase of Kolb's cycle. It successfully moves the hearer from a surface-level understanding of money to a deep theological realization of their need for grace. While it is slightly imbalanced toward the 'head' (Abstract Conceptualization), the powerful Christological conclusion provides the necessary 'heart' (Visionary) to motivate change. To reach a broader range of learning styles, future sermons should aim for more narrative immersion and more granular practical application."
