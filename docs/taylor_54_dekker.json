As a matter of fact, you greatly compliment us in the Brooklyn Concord Church by carrying the name. [...] I rest your dearest hope upon the integrity of my word. I go to get a place ready for you. If I go, I will come and take you to be with me — forever."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses the text as a springboard for a general theme ('search') rather than actualizing the specific, unique content of John 12:20-21. It fails to identify what is in this passage that can be found nowhere else. Instead, it treats the text as a generic illustration of human seeking.",
      "quotes": [
        "All of life is a search, sometimes a painful one.",
        "In chapter twelve of the Gospel of John, we are introduced to some Greeks who are in search."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the specific theological significance of *Greeks* (Gentiles) appearing at this exact moment in John's narrative—signaling the 'hour' of Christ's glorification—rather than using them as a symbol for universal human psychology."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Exegesis is superficial. While it mentions Calvin's view on the Greeks and Philip's background, it lacks depth in Greek/Hebrew linguistic analysis or the specific Johannine theology of the 'hour.' The historical context of the 'feast' is mentioned but not explored.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now, these Greeks were either native Greeks or, as John Calvin thought, they were Jews who had lived a long time in a Greek-speaking climate.",
        "Philip came from Bethsaida, which was a large Greek colony."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond biographical trivia about Philip to the theological necessity of the cross that follows this request in the text (which the sermon ignores)."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application is broad and leans toward general truths about life stages (infancy to old age). While it mentions the church anniversary and specific local contexts, the spiritual application remains largely in the realm of general 'ambition' and 'brokenness' rather than concrete contemporary challenges.",
      "quotes": [
        "The young adult searches for a mate, for a vocation, for a life's work. The middle-aged person searches for security.",
        "I yearn that our nation would get hold a little more of the Lord."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Replace the 'cradle to grave' survey with a concrete analysis of the 'zeitgeist'—how specifically do people today 'search' in a way that this text addresses uniquely?"
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured as a series of thematic reflections triggered by the text, but the text is often left behind for long stretches of anecdotal illustration (Michelangelo, Tennyson, personal reminiscence). The hearer is not drawn *into* the text, but rather the text is used to validate the preacher's themes.",
      "quotes": [
        "In one of the Arthurian legends, Sir Bedivere...",
        "It was said that Michelangelo, the sculptor..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application arises directly from the exegetical discovery of the text's unique point, rather than alternating between a verse and a long secular poem or legend."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The categories of misery (guilt, mortality) and redemption (forgiveness, resurrection) are present. However, they are treated somewhat psychologically ('the storm inside') rather than strictly 'before God.' Gratitude is the weakest of the three parts here.",
      "quotes": [
        "Have you ever felt all miserable inside because you had broken faith...",
        "Hear him say—nobody else can say it—'Thy sins are forgiven.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' from psychological 'unfulfillment' to the theological state of being lost without the mediation of Christ."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are almost entirely absent. The sermon emphasizes that 'you do not have to wait to follow the Lord until you understand everything,' but it lacks the gravity of the possibility of being lost. It is a 'safe' sermon where the 'narrow way' is not contrasted with 'destruction.'",
      "quotes": [
        "I rest your dearest hope upon the integrity of my word."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the urgency of the 'search'—what happens if the Greeks (or the modern hearer) do *not* see Jesus? Address the reality of temporal or eternal loss."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The preacher explicitly demands that the congregation 'see Jesus' rather than his own oratory. He presents Christ as the source of life and the answer to mortality. This is the strongest point of the sermon according to Dekker's criteria.",
      "quotes": [
        "Never mind your skill of oratory: 'We would see Jesus.'",
        "Man has no life in himself, it is Christ who is his life."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect Christ's role as 'telos' more firmly to the specific Johannine context of the Grain of Wheat (John 12:24), which is the immediate answer Jesus gives to the Greeks."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 18.5 minutes, the sermon falls just short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. More importantly, it lacks 'breadth' in its theological depth, filling time with literary anecdotes rather than scriptural 'exposition and application.'",
      "improvement_point": "Increase the depth of biblical exposition to reach the 20-minute mark, rather than relying on external legends (Arthurian/Michelangelo) to provide length."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily by substituting general human psychology and literary illustrations for specific biblical exposition. It fails to identify the unique theological contribution of the pericope and lacks the gravity of the 'two ways.' However, it maintains a clear Christocentric focus and a strong sense of the preacher's role as a transparent medium for the Word.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christocentric focus: The preacher correctly identifies Christ as the goal (telos) of the sermon.",
      "Adequate sense of the preacher's office: The insistence on 'Sir, we would see Jesus' in the pulpit shows a proper understanding of the minister's subordination to the Word."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specificity: The sermon treats the text as a general theme of 'searching' rather than uncovering what this specific passage says that no other does.",
      "Excessive use of external 'prior knowledge': Dogma and literature (Tennyson, Michelangelo) do not 'sleep' but dominate the foreground, obscuring the text's own voice.",
      "Absence of the 'Two Ways': The sermon lacks the necessary tension of the possibility of being lost."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'speech about a biblical keyword' (the search) rather than a sermon in Dekker's strict sense. It lacks the exegetical depth and the specific 'present of revelation' required to be a form of the Word of God."
