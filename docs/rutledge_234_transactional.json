    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exceptionally healthy example of Adult-Adult communication. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent (shaming) or the Smothering Nurturing Parent (sentimentalism). By being honest about human depravity (Adult reality testing) and grounding hope in a 'Better Bet' (External Reality), the preacher fosters a sense of psychological security and intellectual integrity.",

      "The heavy reliance on intellectual 'Adult' processing might leave the 'Free Child' of the listener slightly under-stimulated emotionally.",
      "The transition from political commentary to theology is sharp and could be perceived as a 'Con' if not handled carefully."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name your biases and invite the congregation to check the 'data' (the Bible) themselves. This maintains the Adult-Adult contract and prevents the formation of dependency."
