    "sermon_start_end": "This fall, we’ve been looking at the subject of prayer, and each week we’re taking one part of the Lord’s Prayer. [...] Spafford is looking at the cross, and that reorders the loves of his heart. He says, “If you’ve done this for me, there is nothing in heaven or on earth that I love more than you.” When you can say that, nothing will cast you down. Let us pray.",

  "kolb_phases_analysis": {
    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience primarily through psychological identification rather than vivid storytelling. It touches the hearer by naming the universal feeling of 'spiraling down' and the envy felt when seeing the 'prosperity of the wicked.' While it lacks a long, immersive narrative at the start, it effectively uses 'slices of life' regarding career reversals and relationship disappointments to ground the text in the hearer's world. However, the experience remains somewhat generalized ('you're in a town and there's an invading army') rather than utilizing a singular, highly specific concrete event to anchor the introduction.",
      "quotes": [
        "How do you pray when you feel like there are bad things inside you, bad things outside you, and you’re just spiraling down?",
        "I’ve been trying to live a good life... but everything is going wrong.",

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength of the sermon. The preacher excels at pausing to explore the 'why' behind the human condition. He deconstructs the motive for 'being good' and exposes it as a form of self-interest. The analysis of envy and the 'beast-like' nature of human instinct provides a deep cultural and psychological critique. He moves beyond the surface problem (bad things happening) to the underlying problem (the heart's orientation).",
      "quotes": [
        "When you say, 'I did something in vain,' what you mean is your motive and your purpose has been thwarted.",
        "Selfishness is a reaction. Selfishness takes no thought. Selfishness is an instinct.",
        "Why are you so upset? It’s not a philosophical, 'Why does God allow evil and suffering?' It’s because you’re having to admit, 'The reason I’ve been living this good life is because I thought it would pay off.'"

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a clear theological framework, specifically the 'Gospel-centered' paradigm. The 'Big Idea' is the reordering of loves through the grace of God. The exegesis of Psalm 73 is solid, particularly the transition in verse 17. The preacher connects the Old Testament sanctuary to the New Testament concept of Christ as the Temple. However, the theological argumentation is highly repetitive of the preacher's known 'center,' which, while clear, might lack fresh exegetical discovery for long-term hearers.",
      "quotes": [
        "To go into the sanctuary means to go to the gospel. It means to go to Jesus Christ.",
        "Only love of the immutable, unchanging, loving God will ever get you to the place where you can look out and say, 'Bad things are happening to me, but my foot does not slide.'",

    },
    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the sermon calls for a 'reordering of loves' and 'going to the sanctuary/gospel,' it remains largely internal and conceptual. There are few concrete action steps for the coming week beyond 'praying in Jesus' name' or 'going to the gospel.' The application is more about a change in perspective (thinking) than a specific change in behavior (doing). The 'how' of reordering one's loves is described as a byproduct of reflection rather than a practiced discipline.",
      "quotes": [
        "The way for us to do that is not by going into some sanctuary, sitting down, and praying a prayer. To go into the sanctuary means to go to the gospel.",

It falls short in providing concrete, external action steps (Active Experimentation), which may leave more action-oriented learners (Accommodating style) feeling somewhat unequipped. The sermon excels in 'Reflective Observation,' providing a masterclass in heart-level diagnosis. It successfully moves the hearer from the 'Concrete Experience' of spiritual despair to the 'Abstract Conceptualization' of the Gospel as the only source of true stability. The logic is impeccable, and the use of metaphors like the 'hiking vantage point' effectively bridges the gap between the ancient text and modern experience. However, the transition from 'understanding' the Gospel to 'practicing' the Gospel in daily life remains the most significant area for improvement.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a highly effective piece of homiletical architecture that successfully navigates the 'Homiletic Window,' though it leans heavily toward the intellectual and reflective quadrants. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon—brilliant in reflection and conceptualization, but lighter on concrete experience and active experimentation. It serves the 'Assimilating' learner exceptionally well, providing a robust theological framework for understanding suffering. To reach a broader range of adult learners, the preacher should focus on translating these profound theological insights into the 'Active Experimentation' quadrant, moving from the 'what' and 'why' to a more robust 'how' of daily Christian practice."
