    "sermon_start_end": "In Easter season our awareness comes to this: Our faith is a contest between the power of death and the power of life. I want to think with you about that contest and how we participate in it. When we think of “death” we think of funerals [...] We would be fortunate to see. We would be enlisted to read. We would be blessed to receive the Spirit. But in the meantime, we can act. We can continue the Acts of the Apostles.",

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a somewhat abstract definition of 'death' before moving into recognizable social categories. It avoids a traditional personal narrative 'hook,' opting instead for a systemic description of the human condition. While it touches on emotions like fear and anxiety, it operates more on a sociological level than a visceral, individual experience level until the anecdote about Will Campbell near the end.",
      "quotes": [
        "When we think of 'death' we think of funerals, mortuaries, and cemeteries.",
        "The power of death wants to talk us out of joy, and energy, and courage.",

        "The introduction is conceptually dense; starting with a concrete 'slice of life' would strengthen the initial engagement.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the strongest phase of the sermon. The preacher excels at analyzing the 'why' behind the human condition. He deconstructs the 'power of death' not as a biological end but as a psychological and social force. He offers a profound cultural critique of how fear and scarcity function to close the future.",
      "quotes": [
        "The power of death has many tools in its kit for closing off our future.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a clear theological framework: the contest between death and life. It uses exegesis of Acts and John to formulate a 'big idea'—that Easter is an act of defiance. The logic is deductive and the theological categories (Empire vs. Kingdom) are well-defined.",

It succeeds in deconstructing the 'power of death' through sophisticated reflective observation, identifying systemic issues like scarcity and greed. However, it falls short of a high score in the 'Active Experimentation' phase, as the calls to action remain largely metaphorical ('walking through the door') or highly specific to a single anecdote (Will Campbell) that may not translate to the average hearer's life. The structure is exceptionally clear, favoring the 'Assimilating' learning style with its numbered points and logical progressions. While it addresses the 'Heart' through visionary language, it is primarily a 'Head' sermon that seeks to change the hearer's worldview so that they might eventually change their actions.",

      "Strengthen the 'Pragmatic' quadrant by asking: 'What is one thing a person can do tomorrow to defy the power of scarcity?'",

      "Incorporate more 'Priestly listening' to the specific, mundane struggles of the local congregation."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a robust, intellectually stimulating piece of homiletics that excels in the 'Reflective Observation' and 'Abstract Conceptualization' phases of Kolb’s cycle. It provides a profound diagnosis of the human condition and a clear theological alternative. Its primary weakness lies in the 'Active Experimentation' phase; while it exhorts the congregation to 'act,' it does not sufficiently bridge the gap between the 'Acts of the Apostles' and the 'Acts of the Modern Parishioner.' It is highly effective for 'Assimilating' and 'Diverging' learners but may leave 'Accommodating' and 'Converging' learners with a sense of theoretical inspiration that lacks a practical outlet. The priority for improvement is to ground the visionary rhetoric in concrete, everyday ethical practice."
