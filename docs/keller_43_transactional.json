  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically sophisticated. It avoids the common 'Critical Parent' trap of tithing-legalism by using an 'Adult' analytical framework. It identifies the psychological 'Game' of giving-to-get (investment vs. gift) and exposes it. While it uses a 'Bait and Switch' to bring the listener to a point of spiritual need, it does so transparently. The impact is likely to promote self-reflection and autonomy rather than guilt-driven dependency.",
    "strengths": [
      "High Adult ego presence promotes critical thinking.",
      "Exposes the 'ulterior transactions' of religious legalism.",
      "Preacher includes himself in the human condition ('I can feel it changing my heart')."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'maggots and worms' rhetoric is a sharp shift into Critical Parent territory that may trigger unnecessary AC fear.",
      "The 'scary point' could be softened to maintain the Adult-Adult contract."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize the 'Free Child' (joy/spontaneity) as the goal of the Christian life to ensure the 'Adult' analysis doesn't become too dry or purely intellectual."
