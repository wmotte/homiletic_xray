      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon takes 1 Corinthians 15 as its basis, but it treats the chapter as a general defense of the Resurrection rather than identifying what is unique to this specific pericope. It functions more as a topical speech on the reliability of the Gospel than an exposition of the particular logic of verses 17-22.",
      "quotes": [
        "In order to give you the full picture, I will be referring to the whole of chapter 15.",
        "Paul sums up the Christian message that he preached everywhere he went."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the 'singular' element of this text—specifically the Adam-Christ typology in v. 21-22—and develop the sermon from that unique angle rather than a general defense of the Resurrection."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates general theological knowledge but lacks specific exegetical depth regarding the Greek text or the specific Corinthian context. The mention of 'archaeology' and 'Gershwin' serves as a hook but does not deepen the understanding of the biblical text itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "Paul was very worried about the Corinthian Christians. They were drifting away from the path of truth and life.",
        "Paul's letters were written much earlier than the four Gospels."

      "improvement_point": "Move beyond general historical-critical remarks. Analyze the specific Greek terms for 'futile' (mataia) or 'first fruits' (aparche) to show how they functioned in the original context."

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the 'zeitgeist' of biblical skepticism and the loss of biblical literacy. However, it leans heavily on an anecdotal example (Cook Kimball) which, while moving, risks becoming a 'general truth' about faith rather than a specific application of the text's logic to the hearer's world.",
      "quotes": [
        "most children today can name forty Pokemon characters whereas they typically don't know anyone from the Bible",
        "You in this congregation parents, grandparents, teachers, clergy must shoulder most of the responsibility."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a somewhat linear path: modern skepticism, then Paul's argument, then a modern funeral story. The exposition and application are more 'stacked' than 'mixed'. The hearer is told about the text rather than being 'expounded' by the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now let's fast-forward to the New Testament.",

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The category of 'misery' (being 'still in your sins' and the 'remorselessness of death') is present. 'Redemption' is clearly outside man (miraculous revelation). 'Gratitude' is the weakest of the three, appearing only briefly at the end.",
      "quotes": [
        "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins.",
        "It is so by the miraculous intervention of our God who has not abandoned us to the grave."

      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by exploring what it means to be 'of all men most to be pitied' in a contemporary context, making the 'redemption' more necessary."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher mentions the 'either-or' quality and the danger of 'believing in vain,' but the ultimate seriousness of being 'lost' (temporal or eternal) is softened by the focus on the reliability of the story rather than the consequence of the choice.",
      "quotes": [
        "It's this or nothing.",

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is strongly Christocentric. Christ is the telos and the source of the 'miraculous revelation.' The doctrine of the Resurrection is treated as the objective grounding of grace.",

        "The story of Paul is really the story of God.",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is approximately 18-19 minutes at a moderate pace. According to Dekker's strict 20-minute rule, it falls slightly short of the 'breadth' required for true depth.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section (Thesis 2) to provide the 'breadth' necessary to support the theological weight of the Resurrection."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily in its lack of specific exegetical depth and its tendency toward topical defense rather than text-specific exposition. It addresses the zeitgeist effectively but relies on anecdotal illustration (the funeral story) to carry the weight that should be carried by the 'singular' word of the text. However, it is strongly Christocentric and avoids the trap of turning the Gospel into mere 'spiritual lessons.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christocentric focus where grace is an objective act of God, not a human feeling.",
      "Clear identification of the zeitgeist (skepticism and biblical illiteracy) as a challenge to the Word.",
      "Avoids 'general truths' by insisting on the historical specificity of the Resurrection."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient use of original languages and specific exegetical context (Thesis 2).",
      "The sermon is slightly too short to achieve the 'depth' Dekker/Miskotte demand (Thesis 8).",
      "The 'Adam-Christ' typology, which is unique to this passage, is mentioned but not explored as the 'nowhere else' point of the text (Thesis 1)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a borderline sermon. It succeeds as a 'proclamatory word' and maintains the 'extra nos' character of the Gospel, but it lacks the rigorous academic 'exposition' (Hebrew/Greek/Dogmatics) that Dekker considers essential for the office of a minister."
