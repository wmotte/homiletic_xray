    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The imagery is functional but largely dependent on the biblical text rather than original poetic invention. Keller utilizes the 'cinematic' quality of the biblical scenes—the triumphal entry, the garden of Gethsemane, and the vision of Stephen—to ground abstract concepts. However, the language remains predominantly conceptual and explanatory. While he mentions the 'stench' of the world in other contexts, here the sensory details are sparse. The strength lies in the 'showing' of Christ's character through narrative vignettes (the little girl, the deaf-mute), which Paul Scott Wilson would identify as effective imagery. Yet, the metaphors for God (the hunter, the cord) are borrowed from C.S. Lewis rather than generated by the preacher, indicating a reliance on literary sources over primary sensory observation.",
      "quotes": [
        "He rode in on a little baby ass, deliberately.",
        "Look at him going to the little dead girl and taking her by the hand and saying, 'Talitha koum,' which means, 'Honey, it’s time to get up.'",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Keller demonstrates exceptional stewardship of language, as advocated by Marilyn Chandler McEntyre. He avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by carefully defining terms like 'Christos' and 'Messiah' for a secular audience. His precision is evident in the way he distinguishes between the 'office' of a king and a priest. The language is economical; every sentence serves the logical progression of the argument. He nuances human experience by describing the 'skin crawl' of New Yorkers facing exclusive claims, showing a deep respect for the hearer's intellectual resistance. The use of 'admirable conjunction of diverse excellencies' (Edwards) is handled with precision, translating 18th-century concepts into modern clarity without losing their theological weight.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus says things that just make New Yorkers’ skin crawl.",
        "The Lord is at your right hand; he will crush kings on the day of his wrath. Boy, isn’t that bloodcurdling.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The rhythm is that of a teacher or a debater rather than a poet. There is a clear staccato cadence in the 'press conference' section, which creates a sense of action. However, the sermon often falls into 'paper language' during the more dense theological sections (e.g., the Jonathan Edwards quote). The musicality is found in the repetition of the 'King and Priest' refrain, which acts as a rhythmic anchor. While the flow is natural for an oral event (Immink), it lacks the 'sober beauty' or lyrical height found in more contemplative Reformed preaching. It is a 'rhetoric of the mind' more than a 'rhetoric of the heart' in terms of its sound value.",
      "quotes": [
        "He is bold. He is undaunted. And then … oh my … look at him.",
        "Yahweh, Yahweh. Then he says, 'I am compassionate. I am gracious. I am forgiving.'",

    },
    "average_score_language": 6.67,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a high degree of precision and pedagogical clarity. Keller acts as a 'steward of the word' by translating ancient concepts into the vernacular of a modern metropolis. While the imagery is effective in its narrative use, it lacks primary poetic intensity. The musicality is functional, supporting a logical argument rather than evoking a sensory atmosphere. It is a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that prioritizes the 'Fides ex auditu' through clear teaching, occasionally at the expense of evocative, sensory-rich language."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a masterful 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with the puzzling nature of Psalm 110—why is it quoted so much? The tension is built through the 'press conference' of Jesus, creating an intellectual and spiritual conflict. The turning point is the move from the 'threatening' King to the 'sympathetic' Priest. The energy does not drop; it moves from the 'box' we put Jesus in to the 'goodness' of God passing by, ending with the 'vision' of Stephen. This is a dynamic journey from A (misunderstanding Jesus) to B (being transformed by his beauty).",
      "quotes": [
        "That raises two incredible questions. The first question is … Who in the world is David talking about?",
        "Now just so some of you can exhale, that was the most threatening, combative part of the sermon.",
        "Only then does all the goodness of God pass before you, and it takes your breath away."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong opening that creates immediate curiosity about a 'neglected' text.",
        "Clear movement from 'problem' (the paradox of the text) to 'solution' (the person of Christ).",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 9,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. Keller practices 'reframing' (Cilliers) by taking the 'strangeness' of Psalm 110 and Melchizedek and using them to reframe the modern New Yorker's desire for an 'impersonal God'. The synthesis between the Old Testament cultus (priests/kings) and modern social workers/policemen is organic and illuminating. He does not smooth over the 'bloodcurdling' parts of the text but uses them to highlight the radicality of the Gospel. The text is not a springboard; the context is truly looked at through the lens of the Scripture.",
      "quotes": [
        "You say, 'Well, that’s pretty hard. Where would I ever get the power to live like that...?'",
        "Some of you might be social workers. Some of you might be policemen. You’re very often working with the same people, and you’re working at loggerheads.",
        "I think Jesus needs to say to us modern people too … 'You can’t put me in a box either.'"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of the Messiah for a secular, pluralistic context.",
        "Honors the 'strangeness' of the Melchizedek figure while making it relevant.",
        "Seamless integration of 18th-century theology (Edwards) with 21st-century psychology."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'American' context is very specific; a broader 'global' context (mentioned in the intro) could be revisited.",
        "The 'hit man for the mafia' example feels a bit like a cliché of 'sin' compared to the nuanced 'New Yorker' analysis.",
        "More specific 'New York' imagery could deepen the contextual integration."

      "reframing_present": "Yes. It reframes God from a 'spiritual force' to a 'personal King and Priest'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "In terms of Ciska Stark's 'Open Work of Art', the sermon is relatively 'closed'. Keller's logic is so tight and his 'reframing' so thorough that there is little room for the hearer to arrive at their own interpretation. It is a 'monovalent' work that seeks to convince and convert. While he acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (the tension of justice and love), he resolves it completely through the substitutionary atonement. The hearer is treated as a 'mature conversation partner' in the intellectual sense, but the 'spiritual' space is tightly managed by the preacher's logic.",
      "quotes": [
        "Until you come to grips with this apparent contradiction... you will not understand all the goodness of God.",
        "I’m going to do a little metaphor on you.",
        "If you know that, you will be a priest and a king for Jesus here in this world."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The 'contradiction' at the heart of God's name creates a space for intellectual struggle.",
        "Acknowledges the 'skin crawl'—giving room for the hearer's resistance.",
        "The ending invitation is warm rather than coercive."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Leave more 'unresolved' questions at the end to stimulate post-sermon reflection.",
        "Allow the 'mystery' of the Priest in heaven to remain a mystery rather than saying 'I don't quite know' and then immediately explaining it.",
        "Reduce the 'must' and 'have to' language to allow for more 'appropriation' (Stark)."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A predominantly closed work of art; it is a 'sealed' logical system of grace."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic is characterized by a powerful narrative arc and masterful contextual integration. Keller excels at 'reframing' reality through the biblical text, creating a dynamic movement from intellectual tension to spiritual resolution. While the structure is logically 'closed'—leaving little room for polyvalence—it is highly effective as a 'performance' of the Gospel. It functions as a 'witness' (Long) that guides the hearer through a carefully constructed drama of divine justice and mercy."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. Keller avoids 'cheap comfort' by leaning into the 'bloodcurdling' and 'threatening' aspects of the text. He does not offer a 'happy ending' without first establishing the 'pain' of justice and the 'cost' of the cross. The emotions evoked (awe, humility) feel authentic because they are grounded in a rigorous theological paradox rather than sentimental anecdotes. He avoids the 'clichéd story' by using the 'baby ass' and 'Melchizedek' as counter-intuitive symbols of power. The only slight lean toward kitsch is the 'hit man for the mafia' example, which is a bit of a preacher's trope.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'hit man for the mafia' example is a slightly tired cliché of 'extreme sin'.",
      "The 'honey, it's time to get up' translation is slightly sentimentalized."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of Jesus' 'speechless weeping' at the tomb of Lazarus.",
      "The honest admission of the 'skin crawl' New Yorkers feel toward exclusivity.",
      "The 'bloodcurdling' description of the judgment in Psalm 110."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the rigorous intellectual honesty; avoid 'stock' examples of sinners and stick to the nuanced 'New York' psychological profiles."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'conjunction of diverse excellencies'. By sustaining the tension between God's absolute justice and absolute love, Keller creates a 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) that is not 'cheap'. Grace is presented as the only logical and spiritual solution to an impossible divine dilemma. However, the space is somewhat 'dogmatically sealed' by the very specific focus on substitutionary atonement as the *only* way to see God's goodness. The 'mystery' is respected in the person of Christ, but the 'mechanism' of grace is explained with such efficiency that the 'wonder' risks being replaced by 'understanding'.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between 'King' and 'Priest' is the engine of the sermon.",
    "mystery_respected": "Partially; the mystery of Christ's person is upheld, but the logic of the atonement is 'explained'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the 'imperative' (being a king/priest) is strictly grounded in the 'indicative' (what Jesus has done).",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'mystery' of the brook and the 'lifting of the head' to breathe more without immediate allegorical explanation."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of the 'Apologetic-Reformed' style. Its beauty lies not in baroque ornamentation or lyrical prose, but in the 'sober beauty' of a perfectly constructed argument. Keller functions as a 'witness' (Long) who uses the 'reframing' power of the Gospel to break through the fixed frames of his secular audience. The poetics of language are subservient to the dramaturgy of the logic; the 'imagery' is found in the theological concepts themselves (the Lion and the Lamb). It is a 'performance' of the Gospel that moves from the 'upsetting' of the hearer's autonomy to the 'resolution' found in the beauty of Christ's character. While it lacks the 'openness' of some modern homiletics, it creates a profound 'Space for Grace' by taking both sin and holiness with aesthetic seriousness.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of ancient text for a modern, skeptical context.",
      "Rigorous avoidance of religious kitsch and sentimentalism.",

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Apologetic-Logic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing) and Thomas Long (Preacher as Witness).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to the 'intellectual seeker' or 'urban professional' who values logic, historical grounding, and psychological depth.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'cinematic' opening that starts with a contemporary scene rather than a text analysis.",
      "Use more 'legato' rhythms during the prayer and conclusion to enhance the 'musicality' of grace.",
      "Trust the 'openness' of the biblical image (like the 'dew from the morning's womb') without immediately explaining it."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically 'convincing' event. It achieves a high score by its internal coherence and the 'admirable conjunction' of intellectual rigor and spiritual warmth. It avoids the pitfalls of kitsch by refusing to simplify the 'bloodcurdling' reality of the text, instead using that very reality to magnify the beauty of grace. While it is more 'closed' than the 'Opera Aperta' model suggests, its effectiveness in 'reframing' the hearer's reality makes it a model of contemporary Reformed aesthetics."
