    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in homiletics. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, appealing to the listener's reason and sense of reality. By focusing on the 'historicity' of the resurrection, the preacher avoids the 'Nurturing Parent' trap of smothering the listener with emotionalism. The use of personal anecdotes (Costco, the cottage) serves to ground the high-level concepts in the 'Here-and-Now' of the Adult. The only slight psychological pressure is the concluding statement regarding being 'in touch with your heart,' which briefly shifts into a Critical Parent stance to secure a commitment.",

    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The concluding 'challenge' could be more Adult-oriented (e.g., 'What do you make of these desires?') rather than Parent-oriented ('If you don't feel this, you are out of touch')."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to present the Gospel as a reality to be reckoned with by the Adult, rather than a rule to be obeyed by the Child. Maintain the transparency between the social and psychological levels of your message."
