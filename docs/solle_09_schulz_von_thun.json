    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher connects the metaphor of the 'eye' with economic reality. The 'Sache' is the incompatibility of God and Mammon. While the exegetical bridge between the 'eye/light' and 'capitalism' is creative, it borders on eisegesis to serve a specific political narrative. The theological depth lies in the definition of 'heavenly treasures' as relationships ('Sein') versus 'earthly treasures' as possessions ('Haben'), echoing Fromm. However, the 'living Christ' as the Barthian center is largely replaced by a structural analysis of global injustice. The 'blue' side is clear but highly filtered through a socio-critical lens, potentially narrowing the biblical text's polyvalence.",

        "Ihr könnt nicht Gott dienen und dem Kapital, scheint mir nach wie vor die beste gegenwärtige Übersetzung.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a persona of a 'prophetic intellectual.' There is a conscious attempt to be transparent about the hermeneutical process ('Ich gehe... so um, dass ich dort anfange, wo die größten Schwierigkeiten zu liegen scheinen'). The 'green' side leaks a sense of urgency and perhaps a slight impatience with traditional piety. The preacher positions themselves as a seeker who finds clarity in radicality. There is little 'image management' in the sense of appearing holier; rather, the preacher presents as a co-thinker and co-struggler against systemic darkness.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ich gehe mit Bibeltexten so um, dass ich dort anfange, wo die größten Schwierigkeiten zu liegen scheinen.",
        "Lieber sage ich, sie »fallen«, weil wir lernen müssen...",

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Schizoid-Compulsive. The preacher maintains a certain intellectual distance (Schizoid) while demanding a very specific, rigorous structural correctness (Compulsive) in how the world is viewed.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is mostly subservient to the 'Cause' (the peace movement/anti-capitalism), but the ego is visible in the intellectual authority of the interpretation.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined by solidarity in 'truth-capability' but also by a subtle paternalism. The preacher uses 'we' frequently, which signals solidarity, but it is a 'we' that is already expected to agree with the preacher's radical political stance. There is a risk of 'relationship noise' for those who do not share the preacher's specific political analysis (e.g., the view on the Third World War); these listeners might feel excluded or judged. The tone is teaching and mobilizing, speaking 'at eye level' only to those who are already on the same political path.",
      "quotes": [
        "meiner? deiner? der unserer Stadt?",
        "Wir sind wahrheitsfähig...",
        "Wir können sehen, das Licht ist in uns."

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward 'Anspruch' (Demand/Law). The 'Zuspruch' (Promise/Gospel) is present in the idea that humans are 'wahrheitsfähig' (capable of truth), but this quickly turns into a heavy moral obligation to act, resist, and change the world. The Gospel risk here is that 'faith' is reduced to 'political action.' The pressure on the listener is high: if you don't act against the military-industrial complex, your 'eye is dark.' This creates a 'Law' of political correctness that might overshadow the 'Gift' of God's acting subject (Immink).",
      "quotes": [
        "Wenn wir »sehen«, werden wir handeln.",
        "Jeder junge Mensch, den wir zum Töten abrichten, [ist] ein Verbrechen.",
        "Wir sind beteiligt daran, eine neue Erde zu schaffen."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Heavily tilted toward Anspruch. The 'Gift' is the capacity to see, but the 'Demand' is the total restructuring of life and society.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Very high. The sermon risks becoming a manifesto where the 'rest' found in Christ is replaced by the 'unrest' of political activism.",
      "strengths": [
        "High mobilizing force.",
        "Refusal to let the listener escape into cheap comfort."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Ground the 'new earth' more in God's promise than in human 'participation'.",
        "Offer a 'Zuspruch' that sustains the listener when they fail to change the system."

  "congruence_and_disruptions": {
    "congruence_judgment": "High congruence between the preacher's radical convictions and the spoken word, but a theological incongruence between the 'rest' of the Gospel and the 'unrest' of the appeal.",
    "dominant_side": "Red (Appeal)",
    "disruptions": "The 'Yellow' side (relationship) is disrupted by the 'Red' side (political demand), which may alienate listeners who are not already activists.",
    "healing_disruption": "Yes. The provocation regarding the '40,000 children' serves as a prophetic disruption that forces the listener to confront reality."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6,
    "summary": "This is a powerful example of 'Political Homiletics.' From a communicative standpoint, it is highly effective in its clarity and consistency. However, through the lens of Schulz von Thun and Karl Barth, it reveals significant imbalances. The 'Blue' side (content) is instrumentalized for the 'Red' side (appeal). Theologically, the sermon risks 'psychologizing' the revelation by making the 'new earth' dependent on human perception and action ('Wir sind beteiligt daran'). The Barthian 'Acting Subject' (God) is largely replaced by the 'Acting Human' who has been enlightened. While the sermon avoids 'non-committal warmth' (anti-depressive), it falls into the 'compulsive' trap of moralizing the entire Christian existence. It is a sermon that 'mobilizes' rather than 'nourishes,' which is a valid prophetic function but a communicative risk for a diverse congregation.",
    "barthian_warning": "High risk of psychologization and sociologization. God is the 'symbol for light' rather than the Sovereign Lord who acts independently of human 'truth-capability'.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Uncompromising clarity of purpose.",
      "Effective use of contemporary imagery (Hiroshima, military advisors).",
      "Authentic prophetic pathos."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Balance the political 'Law' with the theological 'Gospel' of justification.",
      "Reduce the moral pressure to allow for a 'fides qua' that isn't just 'activism'.",
      "Broaden the 'Yellow' side to include those struggling with the sermon's radicality."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A rhetorically strong, prophetic-political address that functions more as a call to arms than a traditional sermon. It lacks the 'diaconal' balance of Zuspruch and Anspruch required for a 7+ score."
