    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates concrete experience primarily through the description of the biblical narrative and the identification of universal human 'storms.' However, it lacks a specific, contemporary personal narrative or a 'slice of life' illustration in the introduction to ground the hearer immediately in their own world. The experience is largely mediated through the biblical text rather than direct contemporary observation.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher pauses to analyze the human condition, specifically the psychological tendency to blame victims as a self-defense mechanism. He explores the 'why' of human resistance to God, deconstructing religious and non-religious motivations with surgical precision. It avoids premature solutions by first exposing the depth of human alienation.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in theological depth. It provides a sophisticated exegesis of the Greek 'ego eimi' and connects it to the Exodus 3 'I Am' revelation. The 'big idea'—that Jesus is the uncontrollable God of Moses who is also the tender Counselor—is logically developed. The connection to the Jonah typology provides a robust theoretical framework for the substitutionary atonement.",

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the sermon calls for 'taking hands off your life,' it remains somewhat abstract. There are few concrete action steps for the coming week. The application is primarily internal/dispositional (trusting God in the storm) rather than external/ethical. It tells the hearer *what* to believe but provides less guidance on *how* to practice this trust in specific daily scenarios.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of the 'Declarative' homiletical style, characterized by high theological precision and deep psychological insight. It effectively completes the Kolb cycle, though it is significantly weighted toward Abstract Conceptualization and Reflective Observation. The exegesis of the 'I Am' and the Jonah typology are the sermon's intellectual backbone, providing the hearer with a robust Christological framework. However, the sermon falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase, offering few concrete, actionable steps for the hearer's daily life. The application remains largely at the level of internal dispositional change. While the 'Reflective Observation' task is handled with exceptional skill—particularly the analysis of human self-defense mechanisms—the 'Concrete Experience' phase relies heavily on the biblical text rather than contemporary life-world engagement.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a highly effective piece of theological advocacy that serves the 'Assimilating' learner well. It provides a clear diagnosis of the human condition and a robust Christological solution. Its primary strength lies in its 'Interpretive' and 'Normative' tasks (Osmer), where it bridges the gap between ancient text and modern psychology. To reach a higher level of homiletical excellence, the preacher should focus on the 'Pragmatic' task, converting these high-level theological insights into specific, manageable actions for the congregation. The priority for improvement is to balance the 'Head' (Conceptualization) with more 'Hands' (Experimentation)."
