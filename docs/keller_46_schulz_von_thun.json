  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a solid exegetical and historical foundation. He effectively bridges the narrative of Mark 14 with John 21, creating a cohesive 'Sache' regarding Peter’s failure and restoration. The use of Richard Bauckham’s historical-critical insights regarding 'shame and honor cultures' adds intellectual weight, moving beyond mere Sunday-school storytelling. The theological distinction between Jesus as 'Moral Exemplar' and 'Substitute' is clearly articulated, aligning with Barthian emphasis on the uniqueness of the Christ-event. However, the 'blue' side occasionally borders on the apologetic, spending significant time defending the historicity of the resurrection, which, while clear, may slightly delay the existential 'touch' of the message.",
      "quotes": [
        "This story is strong evidence that the Gospels are eyewitness accounts.",
        "Jesus Christ was raised for our justification and raised for our salvation.",
        "The resurrection is your proof that it was all paid for."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear distinction between substitutionary atonement and moralism.",
        "Effective use of historical context (shame/honor culture)."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The apologetic section on 'hard work' to believe could be more integrated into the theological promise.",
        "Slightly repetitive in the 'historical evidence' section."
      ],
      "comprehensibility_check": "High. Complex theological concepts like 'homo incurvatus in se' are explained through accessible analogies like Costco receipts."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as an intellectual mediator—someone who values scholarship (referencing Bauckham, Augustine, Luther) but also possesses a pastoral heart. There is a controlled 'green' signal: he does not overshare personal trauma but uses the story of Dick Lucas to indirectly reveal the struggle with pastoral 'lambs.' The 'I' is largely diaconal, serving the text. However, there is a certain 'Compulsive' (Riemann) trait in the structured 'four principles' approach, suggesting a need for order and cognitive control over the mystery of the resurrection. The authenticity is found in the sober, non-sentimental tone, which avoids 'hysterical' emotional manipulation.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s almost comical I’m going to try to cover all of those principles so briefly.",
        "I actually believe all Christians... cannot just say, 'Well, I was raised believing that.'",
        "Who will deliver me from this body of death?"
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Schizoid mix. The preacher seeks structure (Compulsive) and maintains a certain intellectual distance (Schizoid) by using third-party anecdotes (Joni Eareckson Tada, Dick Lucas) rather than personal vulnerability.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The preacher's personality is subservient to the 'Sache'. He acts as a guide rather than the protagonist.",
      "strengths": [
        "Avoids unhealthy emotionalism.",
        "Honest about the difficulty of the task."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could risk more personal 'Selbstenthüllung' regarding his own 'fires'.",
        "The structure feels slightly rigid."
      ]
    },
    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching-Solidary'. The preacher places himself and the congregation on the same level of 'moral failure' (homo incurvatus in se). By using 'we' and 'us', he avoids a paternalistic 'from above' stance. However, the 'yellow' side is somewhat clinical. He diagnoses the listener's heart (disordered loves) with surgical precision. While this is helpful, the 'Relationship Ear' might perceive a slight pressure to 'do the hard work' of belief. The tone is that of a seasoned mentor who expects the listener to engage intellectually and volitionally.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s supposed to change you and me.",
        "You are, as Martin Luther says, homo incurvatus in se.",
        "You have some fires you need to go to with Jesus."

      "relationship_noise_check": "The insistence on 'doing the hard work' of checking evidence might alienate those currently in a state of spiritual exhaustion.",
      "attitude_indication": "Solidary Mentor/Teacher.",
      "strengths": [
        "Strong sense of 'we' in the experience of failure.",
        "Respectful of the listener's intellectual doubts."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'you must' language in the four principles can feel slightly demanding.",
        "Could benefit from more 'Zuspruch' in the relational tone."
      ]
    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest side. The preacher masterfully navigates the tension between Law (Anspruch) and Gospel (Zuspruch). The appeal is not to 'try harder' (which he explicitly deconstructs using Peter's failure) but to 'submit to the pattern' of grace. The 'red' side is directional but theologically grounded: the 'demand' is to stop performing and start receiving. He successfully avoids moralism by showing that even the 'appeal' to feed sheep is a result of being 'plunged into grace.' The ratio is heavily weighted toward the 'Gift' (Zuspruch), making the 'Task' (Anspruch) a grateful response.",
      "quotes": [
        "If Jesus Christ came as a moral exemplar... he’s a failure. In fact, he’s worse than a failure.",
        "Nothing makes you more effective... than your failure plunged into a sea of my grace.",
        "Let Jesus take you to your fires and sit down with you."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Excellent. The promise of grace is the ontological foundation for the call to leadership.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Low. He explicitly warns against using willpower as a substitute for grace.",
      "strengths": [
        "Radical focus on grace as the catalyst for change.",
        "Deconstruction of the 'willpower' myth."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition to the 'four principles' at the start felt a bit like a 'to-do list'.",
        "The final appeal could be even more invitational and less analytical."
      ]
    }
  },
  "congruence_and_disruptions": {
    "congruence_judgment": "High congruence. The preacher’s sober, analytical style matches the 'blue' content, and his refusal to use emotional 'hype' aligns with his theological point that grace is an objective reality, not just a 'feel-good factor'.",
    "dominant_side": "Blue (Factual) and Red (Appeal/Gospel Direction).",
    "disruptions": "A minor disruption occurs when the preacher calls the resurrection a 'magic trick' to dismiss a superficial view; this might momentarily jar the 'Factual Ear' of a literalist.",
    "healing_disruption": "The 'healing disruption' occurs when he uses Peter's public cursing of Jesus to shatter the listener's illusions of their own 'nobility'. It puts the relationship under pressure to reveal the truth of the human condition."
  },
  "reception_simulation": {
    "the_factual_ear_hears": "A well-reasoned argument for the historicity of the Gospels and a clear dogmatic explanation of substitutionary atonement.",
    "the_relational_ear_hears": "I am a failure, but I am in good company with the preacher and Peter, and there is a safe space at the 'fire' for me.",
    "the_appeal_ear_hears": "I need to stop trying to save myself through my own efforts and instead repent and accept grace.",
    "the_self_revelation_ear_hears": "The preacher is an intellectually rigorous man who has likely wrestled with these texts deeply and values 'truth' over 'sentiment'."
  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a strong, 'Ample Satisfactory' to 'Good' sermon that excels in theological precision. It avoids the common pitfall of turning the resurrection into a mere metaphor for 'hope' or a moralistic 'call to action'. Instead, it grounds the 'change' in the objective work of Christ. The psychological insight into Peter’s 'shame' is used not for therapy, but to point toward the Barthian 'Acting Subject' (God). The preacher’s use of the Four-Sides model is implicitly balanced, though the 'Green' side remains somewhat guarded. The transition from the 'Blue' (evidence) to the 'Red' (grace-based appeal) is seamless. The sermon’s greatest strength is its refusal to let the listener off the hook of their own failure, only to immediately offer the 'Zuspruch' of the Gospel. It is a 'diaconal' sermon where the preacher’s intellect serves the congregation’s need for a robust faith.",
    "barthian_warning": "The preacher successfully avoids 'unhealthy psychologization' by insisting that the resurrection is a historical event, not just an internal experience. He keeps God as the 'Acting Subject' who restores Peter.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological clarity on Substitution vs. Exemplar.",
      "Effective use of historical-cultural context to deepen the narrative.",
      "Strong Law/Gospel distinction."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce the 'Compulsive' structural rigidity (the 'four principles' list).",
      "Increase personal 'Green' vulnerability to soften the 'Blue' intellectualism.",
      "Shorten the apologetic section to allow more space for the 'Yellow' relational warmth."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively integral and theologically sound sermon that respects the listener's intelligence while challenging their self-sufficiency."
