    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes the inherent imagery of the Jonah narrative well, but adds little original sensory detail of its own. It relies on the 'cinematic' quality of the biblical text—the whale, the plant, the worm—rather than creating new metaphors. The preacher effectively uses the 'show, don't tell' principle by recounting the humor of the story (the cattle in sackcloth), which helps the audience visualize the absurdity. However, the contemporary application remains somewhat abstract, lacking the 'stench' or 'texture' that Wilson or Cilliers advocate for. The imagery serves the teaching but does not transcend into the poetic.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Assyrian king repents instantly and orders the whole population, including the cows and horses, to put on sackcloth and ashes.",
        "God causes a nice green plant to grow up over Jonah’s head to protect him from the ferocious Middle Eastern sun.",
        "Jonah storms out of Nineveh, sits down on the ground, and glares back at the repentant city."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of the biblical narrative's inherent humor.",
        "Clear visualization of Jonah's physical posture (glaring, sitting).",

        "Incorporate more sensory details regarding the 'disturbance' in the congregation to ground the grace.",
        "Develop the metaphor of 'not knowing right hand from left' into a more visual contemporary scene.",
        "Use more evocative language for the 'withered plant' to mirror the internal state of the preacher/hearer."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Balanced: The preacher 'shows' the biblical drama effectively but 'tells' the theological application (e.g., 'this is comforting and encouraging')."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably clear and free of dense 'Canaanite' jargon, fitting McEntyre’s stewardship of language. The preacher explains theological concepts through human dynamics (the 'lazy bums' in the vineyard). There is a deliberate precision in defining Jonah as a 'paradox' and a 'joke.' The use of the 1990 political context (Iraq/Kuwait) provides a sharp, precise frame for 'enemy-hate.' While the vocabulary is not high-poetic, it is honest and hits the core of the human condition without hiding behind religious platitudes.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Israelites hated and despised the Assyrians as much as the Kuwaitis of 1990 hate and despise the Iraqis.",
        "Sometimes we are the people of Nineveh, pitiful in our ignorance and stupidity.",
        "I catch myself in some egregious mistake or rebellious act."

        "Avoidance of 'stained-glass' language in favor of directness.",
        "Precise contemporary analogy (Iraq/Kuwait) for ancient geopolitical hatred.",
        "Honest self-disclosure regarding 'self-centered behavior'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The phrase 'lazy bums' is effective but borders on a cliché that could be more nuanced.",
        "The transition to the Daniel prayer could be more linguistically prepared to bridge the informal and formal tones.",
        "Some repetitive use of 'really' and 'quite' could be tightened for greater economy."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Low jargon: Theological terms like 'grace' and 'mercy' are contextualized through narrative rather than left as abstract dogmas."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The rhythm is that of a teacher or a storyteller—informal and conversational. It lacks the intentional cadence or rhetorical parallelism found in high-style preaching. The sentences are functional rather than musical. However, the shift at the end to the liturgical prayer of Daniel introduces a sudden, stark change in rhythm (staccato petitions) that provides a necessary aesthetic 'weight' to the conclusion. The body of the sermon is 'paper language' that sounds like a transcript of a talk rather than a composed oral performance.",
      "quotes": [
        "In fact, I think people have been turned off by the whale business, as though such a silly story could not possibly be worth serious attention.",
        "God asks him, in a rather sly way, 'Are you really so angry about Nineveh, Jonah?'",
        "O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, listen and act."

      "strengths": [
        "Natural, conversational flow that suits an informal mid-week setting.",
        "Effective use of the 'zinger' (the punchline) to break the rhythm.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "Use more alliteration or parallelism in the central teaching sections to increase memorability.",
        "Vary sentence length more intentionally to create 'breathing room' for the heavier theological points.",
        "Reduce the use of 'filler' phrases like 'In fact' and 'No doubt'."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Primarily oral/conversational language, though it lacks the poetic elevation often associated with 'musical' preaching."
    },
    "average_score_language": 6.0,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by a 'sober beauty' and directness. It excels in clarity and the use of humor to dismantle religious pretension. While it lacks high-poetic musicality or original metaphor, its stewardship of language is evident in its refusal to use jargon. It relies heavily on the narrative power of the Jonah story itself, acting as a transparent window to the text rather than an opaque work of art in its own right."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with a paradox (the 'upsetting'), moves through the tension of Jonah’s anger, and reaches a 'zinger' or turning point in God’s question. The preacher then masterfully pivots from the story to the 'now' (Nineveh 'R' Us). The movement from the humor of the fish to the gravity of the Daniel prayer creates a satisfying dramaturgical arc—from laughter to kneeling. It is not a static three-point sermon but a journey of identification.",
      "quotes": [
        "The book of Jonah is a paradox.",
        "Then God delivers the zinger...",
        "I invite you to join with me by kneeling as I read the prayer of Daniel."

        "Strong 'turning point' where the audience is forced to identify with the 'bad guys'.",
        "Effective transition from the 'humorous' to the 'holy'.",
        "The conclusion is not just words but a physical action (kneeling), completing the drama."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The introduction could more quickly establish the 'disturbance' in the congregation to heighten the initial tension.",
        "The middle section comparing Jonah to the laborers/prodigal son is a bit 'busy' and slows the momentum.",
        "The 're-entry' into the Daniel prayer could be more organically tied to the 'Nineveh' identity."

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. The 'reframing' (Cilliers) is profound: the preacher takes the 'enemy' (Assyria/Iraq) and reframes the congregation as those very people. By titling it 'Nineveh “R” Us', the preacher breaks the fixed frame of the 'righteous congregation' and places them in the 'space of the between'—between disobedience and mercy. The integration of the 1990 political climate provides a sharp, non-clichéd bridge that makes the ancient text feel dangerously contemporary.",
      "quotes": [
        "Nineveh “R” Us",
        "The Israelites hated and despised the Assyrians as much as the Kuwaitis of 1990 hate and despise the Iraqis.",

      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of the congregation as the 'ignorant Ninevites'.",
        "Courageous use of contemporary political tension to illustrate biblical hatred.",

      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could explore the 'Assyrian' identity of the congregation more deeply—what specifically makes them 'Ninevites' today?",
        "The connection between the Jonah story and the Daniel prayer is slightly forced; a deeper bridge between 'Jonah's silence' and 'Daniel's prayer' would help.",
        "Ensure the 'humor' doesn't distance the hearer too much from the 'gravity' of the context."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing: The sermon successfully shifts the congregation's self-perception from 'Jonah' (the judge) to 'Nineveh' (the judged/forgiven)."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is an 'open work' in that it invites the hearer to play 'both parts' (Jonah and Nineveh). It acknowledges the ambivalence of human experience ('I have played both these parts in one hour'). However, the ending, while liturgically powerful, is somewhat 'closed' by the prescriptive nature of the Daniel prayer. It moves toward a resolution of the 'disturbance' through a specific act of repentance. While it respects the mystery of grace, it guides the hearer toward a very specific liturgical response.",
      "quotes": [
        "We play both the parts at different times in our lives.",
        "Which of these categories do you think we as a congregation belong in?",
        "I invite you to join with me by kneeling..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the complexity of the human heart (being both judge and sinner).",
        "Uses questions to prompt congregational self-reflection.",
        "Leaves the 'disturbance' unnamed, allowing hearers to project their own needs into the 'Nineveh' frame."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Avoid the 'I think' and 'My sense is'—let the text's openness speak more for itself.",
        "The conclusion could leave a question hanging rather than resolving everything in a formal prayer.",
        "Allow more room for the 'resistance' Jonah felt—why is it so hard for us to accept grace for others?"
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Semi-open: Polyvalent in its identification (Jonah/Nineveh) but monovalent in its liturgical resolution."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are strong, driven by a clear narrative movement and a powerful 'reframing' of identity. The sermon avoids the 'three-point' trap, opting instead for a dramaturgical progression that leads the hearer from a position of judgment to a position of humility. The integration of the 1990 historical context is a masterclass in making a text 'happen' (Immink) in the present moment."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably anti-kitsch. It avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by acknowledging the preacher's own 'egregious mistakes' and 'self-centered behavior.' It uses humor not as a superficial 'beautifier' but as a tool for subversion. The grace offered is not 'cheap comfort' but a 'zinger' that hurts the ego. By identifying the congregation with the 'ignorant' Ninevites rather than the 'heroic' Jonah, it bypasses religious sentimentality.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential for a 'God loves everyone' platitude is present but avoided through the Iraq/Kuwait analogy.",
      "The mention of 'lazy bums' is a slight linguistic cliché, but serves a rhetorical purpose."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The preacher's admission of feeling 'little compassion' for an annoying person.",
      "The identification of the congregation with 'Ninevites' during a time of 'disturbance'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the sharp edge of the 'enemy' analogy to ensure grace remains 'scandalous' rather than merely 'nice'."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by dismantling the 'righteous' frame of the congregation. Cilliers' 'Space for Grace' is created when the preacher admits to being a 'Ninevite.' The sermon sustains the tension between our desire for justice (Jonah) and our need for mercy (Nineveh). However, the 'dogmatic' move to the Daniel prayer slightly 'seals' the space by providing a formal religious exit, rather than letting the 'mystery' of the fish and the worm linger longer.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between being the 'older brother' and the 'prodigal' is held throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'humor' of God's actions respects the 'unavailability' of God's logic.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the sermon is an invitation to receive mercy rather than a list of 'must-dos'.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'silence' of the end of the Jonah story (God's unanswered question) to resonate more before moving to the Daniel prayer."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of the 'Aesthetic Turn' in its focus on perception and reframing. It avoids the 'vertical' authoritarianism of Thurneysen, opting instead for a 'horizontal' identification between preacher, text, and congregation. Its primary aesthetic power lies in its structure—specifically the 'reframing' of the congregation as Nineveh. While the language is more functional than poetic, its precision and lack of kitsch provide an authentic aesthetic depth. It functions as an 'event' (Immink) where the congregation is moved from the seat of the judge to the place of the supplicant. The use of humor serves as a 'rhetorical iconoclasm,' breaking down the idols of congregational self-righteousness to make space for the 'holy' to happen.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "The 'Reframing' of the congregation as Nineveh.",
      "The use of humor as a theological and aesthetic tool.",
      "The honest, non-kitsch self-disclosure of the preacher."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Elevate the musicality and poetic rhythm of the prose.",
      "Deepen the sensory imagery beyond the biblical text's own descriptions.",
      "Create a more organic bridge between the Jonah narrative and the Daniel liturgy."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Reframing (Sober-Reformed influence)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Anti-kitsch) and Paul Scott Wilson (Narrative Arc).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to a modern, perhaps slightly cynical or 'church-weary' audience that appreciates honesty, humor, and intellectual sophistication over emotional manipulation.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'showing' contemporary grace through a modern 'parable' or image.",
      "Focus on the 'sound' of the words to move from a 'talk' to a 'performance'.",
      "Leave the conclusion more 'open' to allow the Spirit more room for individual appropriation."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon 'Nineveh “R” Us' is an aesthetically effective piece of homiletic craftsmanship. It succeeds not through 'beautifying' the word, but through the 'beauty of simplicity' and the radicality of its perspective shift. By placing the congregation in the 'wrong' part of the story, it opens a genuine 'Space for Grace.' It is a model of how to use narrative structure to achieve a theological goal without falling into moralism or kitsch. While it could benefit from more 'micro-aesthetic' linguistic polish, its 'macro-aesthetic' movement is compelling and transformative."
