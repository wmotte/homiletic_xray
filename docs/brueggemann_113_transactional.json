    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in homiletics. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state, addressing the listeners as capable, thinking subjects. It identifies the 'Adapted Child' state of the culture (anxiety, fear-based withdrawal) and offers a path toward the 'Free Child' (imagination, joy) and 'Adult' (action, responsibility). The use of the Le Chambon story illustrates 'Autonomy' in the TA sense—acting not out of script or demand, but out of an integrated sense of self.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult appeal.",
      "Avoids the trap of 'Ain't It Awful' despite discussing violence.",
      "Promotes autonomy and personal agency."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Slight risk of 'Parental' identity-giving (telling people who they are rather than helping them discover it).",
      "The 'we' language is inclusive but could occasionally mask the need for individual Adult decision-making."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to frame the 'Vision' as a choice for the listener's Adult to evaluate, rather than a Parent's mandate to obey. The Le Chambon example is a perfect model for game-free living."
