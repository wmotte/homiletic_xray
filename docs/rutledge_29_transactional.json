It avoids heavy-handed manipulation by framing the 'frontier' as a place of personal responsibility. However, it flirts with 'Ain't It Awful' by contrasting extreme martyrdom with mundane consumerism, which can trigger a shame-based Adapted Child response in the listener.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To remain game-free, invite the 'Free Child' to imagine the joy of the 'New World' more vividly, rather than relying on the 'Critical Parent' to police the boundaries of the 'Old World.'"
