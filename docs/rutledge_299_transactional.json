    "summary": "This sermon is an exceptionally healthy example of homiletic communication. It avoids the typical religious games of guilt-tripping (Critical Parent) or creating dependency (Smothering Nurturing Parent). Instead, it uses the Adult ego state to process complex geopolitical realities and the Free Child ego state to celebrate authentic joy. By acknowledging the 'devils in Rwanda' alongside the 'miracle in South Africa,' the preacher maintains reality-testing (Adult) while inviting the listener into a hopeful, non-coercive faith. The use of the 'toyi-toyi' train as a metaphor for faith—singing of liberation while still in chains—is a powerful endorsement of psychological resilience and autonomy.",
