  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of high-church liturgical Nurturing Parent communication. It provides significant emotional comfort and a sense of belonging (NP), which is psychologically stabilizing. However, it relies on a 'magical' view of ritual ('morphing') and uses Critical Parent 'shaming' to enforce liturgical decorum. The congregation is kept in a Child position—receptive, bowing, and dependent on the 'authorized' mediator for their 'power for life.'",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong sense of emotional safety and grace in the description of God.",
      "High imaginative engagement (Free Child) through movie metaphors."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Reduction of Critical Parent 'shaming' regarding cell phones and watches.",
      "Increase Adult-to-Adult transactions by inviting the congregation to describe their own 'morphing' rather than dictating it."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try replacing 'You cannot' (CP) with 'When we do X, we risk missing Y' (Adult). Move from being the 'Authorized Mediator' (Rescuer) to a 'Fellow Traveler' (Adult) to encourage true autonomy in the congregation."
