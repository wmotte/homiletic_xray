  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a solid exegetical foundation by comparing the Synoptic accounts (Matthew, Mark, Luke). He addresses the discrepancies regarding the location (entering vs. leaving Jericho) with a pragmatic theological lens: the 'Sache' (the encounter with Christ) outweighs the historical-critical minutiae. However, the 'blue' side remains relatively thin on deep dogmatic development. The transition from physical blindness to spiritual vision is a standard allegorical move. While Barthian 'Christocentrism' is present, the factual content serves more as a springboard for the existential 'I' than for a rigorous unfolding of the Word as an objective reality. It is clear and accessible, but lacks intellectual 'bite' for the more discerning 'factual ear'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Matthew places this request... as happening while Jesus and his disciples leave Jericho. Mark and Luke suggest that it happened as Jesus approached.",
        "The text from Mark, alone of the accounts, gives us the name of the blind man.",
        "Jericho is only about fifteen miles from Jerusalem. Jesus is moving very near to Calvary."

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as a man of deep, traditional piety who values emotional intensity over 'polite' religion. There is a palpable sense of pastoral urgency. He uses the 'I' frequently, not to boast, but to model the 'wretched man' of Romans 7. He reveals a slight impatience with 'respectable' or 'formal' worship, which suggests a personality that prizes authenticity and 'warmth'. The self-revelation is largely diaconal; he positions himself as a fellow beggar. However, there is a hint of the 'stage-awareness' typical of the Hysterical type, particularly in the dramatic references to the pulpit's floor inscriptions and the use of poetic quotations to frame his own soul's state.",
      "quotes": [
        "Paul's cry is my cry, 'Sin... dwelleth in me.'",
        "I told the workman to paint on this floor... 'Sir, we would see Jesus.'",
        "I loved my mother in life and I love her in death."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Hysterical/Depressive hybrid. Hysterical in his dramatic flair and use of 'stage' elements (the floor painting); Depressive in his deep need for closeness to Jesus and his emphasis on 'mercy' and 'harmony' through the Savior.",
      "diaconal_quality": "High. The preacher's 'I' is used to point toward the need for Grace.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching/Paternalistic'. The preacher directs the congregation's behavior ('Don't let nobody turn you 'round') and critiques their potential fashion choices or social behaviors as proxies for spiritual vanity. There is a 'we-definition' of being 'poor and needy sinners', which creates solidarity, but the tone occasionally shifts to a 'from-above' correction. The use of 'we' often feels like a 'preacher's we'—inclusive but still directed by the one in the pulpit. The 'yellow' signal is one of a concerned father who is slightly frustrated by the 'politeness' of his children's faith.",
      "quotes": [
        "I know that some people would not put on the clothes they do if they knew how they look in them.",
        "Don't let nobody turn you 'round.",
        "Many of us would cry more earnestly if we knew how alarming is our case."

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the strongest side of the sermon. The preacher masterfully navigates the tension between Law (Anspruch) and Gospel (Zuspruch). The appeal is not to 'work harder' but to 'cry louder' for mercy. He correctly identifies that the only 'work' of the believer is the recognition of total dependency. The 'red' side is a call to faith and trust (fides qua). By contrasting Jesus with Moses, Socrates, and Buddha, he isolates the 'Gift' (Zuspruch) as the only solution. The appeal is urgent ('Cry now, my soul'), yet it leads toward 'Rest' in the blood of Christ rather than a new list of moral duties.",
      "quotes": [
        "Not Moses, for he says I must be clean... Give me Jesus.",
        "If more of us knew how bad is our condition, we would cry more desperately.",
        "He alone says, 'If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.'"
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Excellent. The demand (cry for help) is entirely predicated on the promise (He will stop and give sight).",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Low. Even the 'moral' critiques are framed as evidence of a need for sight, not as a checklist for salvation.",
      "strengths": [
        "Clear distinction between the Gospel and other worldviews.",
        "Powerful use of hymnody to reinforce the 'Gift' aspect."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Ensure the urgency doesn't devolve into psychological pressure.",
        "Clarify that the 'crying out' is also a gift of the Spirit, not a human work."

    "disruptions": "The 'Yellow' side (relational) occasionally disrupts the 'Blue' (factual) content with distracting comments on social decorum/fashion.",

  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a potent example of 'Kerygmatic' preaching that prioritizes the existential encounter with Christ over abstract doctrine. The preacher successfully utilizes the Schulz von Thun dimensions to create a sense of 'Kairos'—the opportune moment that must not be missed. Theologically, it aligns with a Barthian emphasis on the 'Acting Subjectivity' of God; Jesus is the one who 'stops' and 'calls'. However, from a psychological perspective, the sermon occasionally leans into 'Hysterical' self-presentation and 'Paternalistic' relational signals that could alienate a modern, autonomous hearer. The 'Blue' factual side is sacrificed for the 'Red' appeal, which is effective for a revivalist context but may lack depth for long-term catechesis. The balance of Law and Gospel is handled with classic Protestant precision, ensuring that the 'Appeal' always ends in 'Promise'.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a slight risk of 'psychologizing' the encounter with God by focusing heavily on the 'intensity' of the human cry as a prerequisite for the miracle.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Masterful use of 'Zuspruch' (Promise).",
      "High level of 'Green' authenticity.",
      "Strong rhetorical urgency and use of hymnody."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Eliminate trivial 'Yellow' critiques (clothing/manners).",
      "Strengthen the 'Blue' exegetical/dogmatic depth.",
      "Balance the 'Hysterical' dramatic flair with more 'Schizoid' distance to let the Text speak for itself."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, traditional sermon that communicates the Gospel with urgency, though it occasionally trips over its own relational paternalism."
