    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes a strong 'landscape' of imagery, moving through valleys, highways, and forests. The preacher effectively translates the abstract concept of 'disappointment' into spatial and sensory experiences. The use of the Esau narrative provides a concrete anchor, contrasting the 'intrigue of drawing rooms' with the 'solitude of the forest.' However, some images lean toward the conventional (e.g., 'leaden skies', 'rocky road'), which prevents a higher score. The imagery serves the 'show, don't tell' principle by placing the hearer in the physical space of the biblical character, allowing the weight of the blessing's loss to be felt rather than just explained.",
      "quotes": [
        "In disappointment's valley, along heartbreak highway, what cry shall we raise?",
        "Esau was a simple, trusting man... most at home in the solitude of the forest, stalking his game.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is dignified and exhibits a high degree of 'stewardship.' There is a clear effort to avoid dense theological jargon, opting instead for a 'human' vocabulary that resonates with the hearer's lived reality. The preacher uses words like 'fidelity,' 'pathos,' and 'poignancy' with precision. However, the sermon occasionally slips into repetitive generalities ('every man, every woman') and somewhat dated rhetorical flourishes that can obscure the specific 'nuance of human experience' McEntyre advocates for. The precision is highest when describing the psychological state of Esau and the 'bewildering' nature of senseless hardship.",
      "quotes": [
        "He was not at home in the intrigue of drawing rooms or the refined scheming of conference rooms.",
        "Forgive us our moods of despair that convince us we are marked for unique trials and sorrows.",
        "There's poignancy and pathos in Esau's cry, but there is also a great triumphant faith."

        "Avoidance of 'Canaanite' jargon in favor of accessible, dignified English.",
        "Precise naming of the 'bewildering' nature of undeserved hardship.",

        "Clarify the transition between the 'spiritual' quote and the Esau analysis."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Very low jargon; theological concepts like 'grace' and 'blessing' are contextualized through the narrative of Esau."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's strongest linguistic feature. It possesses a clear oral cadence, likely influenced by the African American preaching tradition. The use of parallelism ('What then? When... What then?') creates a rhythmic tension that mirrors the heartbeat of a person in crisis. The sentence structures vary effectively between short, punchy questions and longer, flowing reflections. The alliteration and assonance (e.g., 'soured and fouled', 'poignancy and pathos') enhance the 'musicality' and make the text feel like a performance even on the page. It avoids 'paper language' entirely, sounding like a living voice.",
      "quotes": [
        "When dreams have faded and hope is limp. What then? When children have disappointed or a love has grown cold. What then?",
        "He is always nearby. Our Calvary may be painful and lonely, our course rough and cruel...",
        "Still must we hold on and hold out and live by the faith that the Lord will not leave."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent use of anaphora ('What then?') to build emotional momentum.",
        "Natural rhythm that facilitates oral delivery and listener retention.",
        "Effective use of rhetorical figures like parallelism and alliteration."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition into the Lincoln anecdote slightly disrupts the established rhythm.",
        "Ensure the 'hosannas' at the end don't feel rhythmically rushed compared to the slow 'valley' sections.",
        "Watch for over-alliteration which can occasionally feel slightly forced."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Distinctly oral language; the text is clearly designed for the ear, not the eye."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high level of micro-aesthetic quality, characterized by a rhythmic, oral style that prioritizes the hearer's emotional journey. The imagery is consistent and evocative, though occasionally reliant on traditional homiletical tropes. The language is precise and avoids the 'stiffness' of academic theology, opting instead for a 'stewardship of words' that honors the gravity of suffering. Its musicality suggests a preacher who understands the sermon as a temporal event, using cadence to sustain attention and deepen the impact of the message."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear, though somewhat traditional, arc. It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with the question 'What then?', immediately engaging the hearer's sense of need. The movement into the Esau narrative provides a central 'plot' that mirrors the hearer's struggle. However, the 'turning point' is more of a gradual shift than a dramatic pivot. The energy remains high, but the structure feels somewhat like a series of waves (problem-example-exhortation) rather than a single, driving journey from A to B. The conclusion offers resolution, but perhaps a bit too predictably toward the end.",
      "quotes": [
        "In disappointment's valley, along heartbreak highway, what cry shall we raise?",
        "Esau appeared later before his father to receive his rightful blessing. Isaac was dumbfounded...",
        "The battle is almost won when we can say through the tears, 'Bless me still, my Father.'"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong opening that immediately establishes the 'stakes' of the sermon.",
        "The use of Esau provides a compelling narrative core that sustains interest.",
        "The conclusion successfully returns to the initial 'cry' of the heart."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Sharpen the 'turning point' where the gospel specifically 'reframes' the disappointment.",
        "Avoid the 'list' of biblical characters in the middle, which slows the narrative momentum.",
        "Create a more surprising movement between the 'lonesome valley' and the 'morning'."

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The integration is handled with skill, particularly through Cilliers' concept of 'reframing.' The preacher takes the ancient, somewhat obscure disappointment of Esau and uses it to reframe the modern hearer's experience of 'jobs turning out to be less than expected' or 'children disappointing.' The transition between the 'then' of Isaac's tent and the 'now' of the hearer's life is organic. The 'strangeness' of the Esau story—a man cheated of a blessing—is respected but made immediately relevant as a universal human experience of 'life tumbling in.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Esau was left out in the cold, so to speak... For all of us, life does tumble in over and over again.",
        "He was not at home in the intrigue of drawing rooms... [like] the demands of life, the call of jobs.",
        "This note echoes and reechoes in the figures of the Bible. Adam had his moment... Abraham had his..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Successful 'reframing' of the Esau narrative as a template for modern disappointment.",
        "Organic transitions between the biblical world and the contemporary context.",
        "Respect for the biblical text's integrity while drawing out universal emotional truths."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection to Psalm 121 at the start is a bit loose; it could be more tightly woven into the Esau story.",
        "The Lincoln/Mary Todd reference feels slightly 'pasted on' compared to the biblical integration.",
        "Deepen the 'reframing' by showing how the *specific* nature of Esau's cry changes our view of God."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes, it reframes individual disappointment as a shared, sacred pilgrimage rather than a 'unique trial'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is where the sermon struggles aesthetically. While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' and the 'lonely way,' the conclusion leans toward a 'closed' system. The resolution ('God can and will heal our hurts') feels somewhat prescriptive and 'sealed shut.' It risks becoming a 'happy ending' that doesn't fully leave room for the hearer who is *still* in the dark. According to Stark's 'open work of art,' the sermon should leave more room for the hearer's own appropriation. Instead, it moves toward a series of 'musts' and certainties that might feel coercive to someone in deep despair.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Judge of all the earth will do right. The desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.",
        "One walking the night with such a faith is sure to come to the morning.",
        "He can make bitter waters sweet for us, and he can turn cloudy days sunny."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Honest acknowledgment of 'hot, fretful moods' and anger toward God.",
        "The invitation to 'bring any mood before God' creates an initial open space.",
        "The use of the Esau story allows for a polyvalent understanding of 'blessing'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Avoid the 'happy ending' clichés like 'turn cloudy days sunny' which can feel like kitsch.",
        "End with an invitation or a question rather than a definitive 'sure to come to the morning'.",
        "Leave more space for the 'not yet'—the reality that some disappointments are never 'healed' in this life."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Starts as an open work (acknowledging pain) but closes into a monovalent 'solution' by the end."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is functional and engaging, successfully bridging the gap between an ancient text and modern life. The narrative arc is clear, and the 'reframing' of Esau’s disappointment is the sermon's structural highlight. However, the sermon suffers from a tendency toward 'closedness' in its final third. By resolving the tensions of the 'lonesome valley' too cleanly with traditional religious promises, it loses some of the 'open work' quality that allows for a truly authentic encounter with the Holy in the midst of unresolved pain."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 5,
    "analysis": "The sermon teeters on the edge of religious kitsch. On one hand, it has 'authentic depth' when it discusses the 'hot, fretful moods' and the 'lonely, deserted way.' These moments take suffering seriously. On the other hand, the latter half employs 'pre-chewed emotions' and clichés ('turn cloudy days sunny', 'glad hosannas'). This 'sentiment' threatens to overwhelm the 'emotion.' Cilliers would warn that the 'happy ending' here is a bit too 'predictable,' potentially blocking a true encounter with the 'Space for Grace' by offering immediate, superficial comfort.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "He can turn valleys of sorrow into sunlit paths of joy.",
      "God can and will heal our hurts and soothe our sorrows and turn our griefs into glad hosannas."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of Esau 'lifting up his voice and wept' without shielding his anguish.",
      "The acknowledgment that we often feel 'marked for unique trials and sorrows'—a very real psychological state."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To increase depth, the preacher should resist the urge to 'resolve' the pain with metaphors of sunshine and roses. Staying longer in the 'lonesome valley' without the immediate promise of a 'sunny day' would create a more authentic aesthetic."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is opened in the first half of the sermon by validating the hearer's anger and disappointment. By allowing Job and Esau to 'pound the table' before God, the preacher creates a 'Space for Grace' that doesn't require the hearer to be 'pious' in their pain. However, the space is partially 'closed' by the end through moralization ('the battle is almost won when we can say...') and dogmatic certainty. The mystery of why some 'desires of our heart are withheld' is acknowledged but then quickly covered over with the assurance that 'God will do right.'",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are introduced well but resolved somewhat cheaply in the final paragraphs.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of suffering is initially respected but eventually 'explained' through the lens of a 'triumphant faith'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the invitation to come as you are, but moralization creeps in with the 'stubborn, unconquerable faith' requirement.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'cry' of Esau to remain a cry. Grace is often found in the fact that God hears the cry, not necessarily in the 'turning of cloudy days sunny'."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically 'good' example of mid-20th-century pastoral preaching. Its primary strength lies in its 'Poetics of Language'—specifically its rhythm and oral cadence, which create a compelling atmosphere of empathy and shared struggle. The preacher successfully 'reframes' the biblical narrative of Esau, making an ancient story feel like a contemporary mirror for the hearer's soul. However, from the perspective of the 'Aesthetic Turn,' the sermon falters in its move toward 'closedness' and 'religious kitsch.' By the end, the 'sober beauty' of the lament is somewhat obscured by clichéd promises of 'sunny paths' and 'glad hosannas.' While it opens a significant 'Space for Grace' by validating human anger and despair, it closes that space prematurely with a 'happy ending' that may not do justice to the 'ambivalence of existence' Stark and Cilliers emphasize. It is a sermon that 'shows' the pain well but 'tells' the solution too traditionally.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional oral rhythm and use of parallelism ('What then?').",
      "Creative and effective 'reframing' of the Esau narrative for pastoral care.",
      "Authentic validation of 'un-pious' emotions (anger, pounding the table) before God."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduction of religious kitsch and clichéd metaphors in the conclusion.",
      "Maintaining the 'openness' of the sermon by not resolving all tensions too cleanly.",
      "Tightening the 'middle' by focusing on one or two biblical examples rather than a long list."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Pastoral with a strong 'Rhythmic-Oral' quality.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Paul Scott Wilson's 'Four Pages' (Trouble/Grace balance) and shows the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers, though lacks the 'Open Work' quality of Ciska Stark.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to hearers seeking emotional resonance and traditional comfort, particularly those in the midst of personal transition or grief.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer in the 'Space for Grace' without a forced resolution.",
      "Use more 'original' sensory imagery to describe God's presence, avoiding 'sunshine' and 'roses'.",
      "Deepen the 'Performance' aspect by allowing silence to follow the 'What then?' questions."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a strong piece of homiletical craft that excels in its linguistic musicality and narrative integration. It avoids being a dry lecture, instead becoming a 'happening' of pastoral consolation. Its aesthetic limitations are found in its traditional 'closed' structure and occasional descent into kitsch, which prevent it from reaching the level of a 'model sermon' in the contemporary aesthetic sense. Nevertheless, it remains a powerful example of how language can be used to 'steward' the pain of a congregation."
