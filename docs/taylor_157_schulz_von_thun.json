[...] The music here of the spiritual celebrates the supreme meeting and dialogue in all of the universe — that between the risen Lord and one who knows that life can be forever different only when the Lord's voice has spoken and the enraptured soul has heard it and replied. 'Mary.' 'Master!'",

    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a solid exegetical framework based on the Johannine account of the resurrection. He correctly identifies the historical and theological weight of the empty tomb, contrasting it with secular 'great news' (Moon landing). The 'Sache' (the living Christ) is central, yet the exegesis remains largely narrative-driven rather than dogmatically dense. He touches on the 'equality of nothingness' without the resurrection, which is a strong Barthian point: without the Act of God, human existence is void. However, the factual side occasionally drifts into anecdotal illustrations (Billy Graham, Vernon Johns) which, while engaging, slightly dilute the rigorous theological 'Sache' of the text itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the greatest news story in the history of this planet",
        "What is there that gives meaning to this crazy quilt we call life where all, the wise and the foolish, die alike?",
        "Mary's word to the disciples is, 'They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher'"

      "strengths": [
        "Clear contrast between secular history and salvation history.",
        "Strong focus on the existential 'Jobian' question of life after death."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Could deepen the christological necessity of the resurrection beyond 'meaning-making'.",
        "Less reliance on external 'authorities' (Billy Graham, Ellen G. White) to bolster the text."

      "comprehensibility_check": "Highly appropriate. The language is vivid and accessible, avoiding academic jargon while maintaining theological gravity."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as a seasoned, perhaps slightly weary but hopeful observer of both the church and society. There is a clear 'Selbstenthüllung' of his own pastoral heart—he values persistence and 'coming back' to the tomb. He reveals a critical stance toward 'sophomoric' science and political slogans, showing a man who has seen trends come and go while the Church remains. His tone is one of 'diaconal' authority; he is not the center, but his voice carries the weight of lived experience. He identifies with the 'timid souls' but speaks from a position of established faith.",
      "quotes": [
        "In my student days in seminary, when new theories of the Bible were being tossed about almost recklessly...",
        "Some of us know the Lord because preachers somewhere kept coming back to the gospel",
        "I believe of all other planets."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive/Compulsive hybrid. He seeks the 'harmony' of the church's continuity (Depressive) but displays a Compulsive need for the 'correctness' of the Gospel over and against 'new slogans' and 'reckless theories'.",
      "diaconal_quality": "High. The preacher's 'I' serves to validate the reliability of the Gospel for the congregation.",

        "Slight tendency toward 'us vs. them' (the 'black-power people' vs. the church) could be perceived as personal bias.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The relationship is one of 'Solidary Teaching'. He speaks as a father figure within the community ('Some of us know the Lord...'). He defines the relationship as a shared journey of love and persistence. There is a strong 'We-definition' that includes the congregation in the historical struggle of faith. However, there is a slight 'paternalistic' edge when discussing those who 'went off' or were 'not well-adjusted', which might create relationship noise for listeners who identify with those movements. Overall, he creates a warm, inclusive atmosphere of 'love that keeps going back'.",
      "quotes": [
        "There are people listening to me now who found a firm footing in life because a mother, a father kept coming back",
        "When are we going to stop confusing things?",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The appeal is masterfully handled as a 'Zuspruch' (Promise). The primary 'demand' is not a moralistic 'do better', but an invitation to 'listen for your name'. He measures the ratio of Law and Gospel effectively: the 'Law' is the reality of death and the 'equality of nothingness', while the 'Gospel' is the personal call of the Risen Lord. The appeal is to 'Faith/Rest/Trust' rather than 'Behavioral Change'. He avoids the pitfall of moralism by grounding the human response in the prior action of Jesus calling Mary's name.",
      "quotes": [
        "Look unto the Lord and be saved.",
        "When he calls me, I will answer. I'll be somewhere listening for my name.",
        "Life can be forever different only when the Lord's voice has spoken."

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Excellent. The 'Anspruch' (follow me) is entirely dependent on the 'Zuspruch' (I know you by name).",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Low. The sermon focuses on the ontological change brought by the Resurrection rather than a list of duties.",
      "strengths": [
        "The appeal is poetic and invitational.",
        "Focuses on the 'Gift' of the encounter."

    "disruptions": "The critique of 1960s/70s radicalism creates a 'Factual/Relational' chafe—it feels like a dated grievance that interrupts the timelessness of the Easter message.",

  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a strong, traditional sermon that excels in the 'Yellow' and 'Red' dimensions. The preacher successfully navigates the tension between the 'Law' of death and the 'Gospel' of the Resurrection. By using the narrative of Mary Magdalene, he moves the congregation from the 'Blue' facts of the empty tomb to a 'Red' personal encounter with the Risen Lord. The sermon is deeply rooted in the African-American homiletical tradition, utilizing rhythm and cultural markers (spirituals) to reinforce the message. Theologically, it aligns with Immink’s view of God as the 'Acting Subject'—it is Jesus who calls, and Mary who responds. The 'Green' side shows a preacher who is congruent and authentic, though perhaps a bit tethered to past ecclesiastical battles. The 'Barthian' requirement is met: the sermon is not about human 'experience' of the divine, but about the 'Event' of the Word calling the individual.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a slight risk of 'psychologizing' the resurrection as a 'meaning-maker' for life's 'crazy quilt', but the preacher recovers by centering the event on the objective voice of Christ.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Masterful use of narrative and pathos.",
      "Strong distinction between human logic and divine love.",
      "Excellent integration of cultural hymnody (Spirituals) as theological evidence."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce dated polemics against 1960s movements to maintain focus on the 'Sache'.",
      "Deepen the exegetical 'Blue' side regarding the significance of the 'folded clothes'.",
      "Avoid over-reliance on external quotes (Pascal, White, Chrysostom) to let the text breathe."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively integral and theologically sound Easter sermon that serves the 'Promise' of the Gospel with pastoral authority."
