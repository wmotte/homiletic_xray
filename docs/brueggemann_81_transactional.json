    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in homiletics. By operating primarily from the Adult ego state, the preacher treats the congregation as autonomous agents capable of self-reflection. The use of the Nurturing Parent is balanced and supportive, providing a 'secure base' from which the listener can explore the 'risky' Free Child territory of imagination and new possibilities. It avoids the 'Bait and Switch' of many Lenten sermons that start with grace and end with a list of 'must-do' chores.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The lyrical language, while beautiful, could occasionally bypass the Adult's need for concrete application in favor of Free Child 'fantasy'.",
      "The ending (Psalm 91) could be misinterpreted as a 'Rescuer' promise of safety that negates the 'risky journey' mentioned earlier."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To maintain this high level of game-free communication, continue to use 'we' instead of 'you' when discussing human failings, and keep centering the 'Adult' logic of the text as the primary driver for change."
