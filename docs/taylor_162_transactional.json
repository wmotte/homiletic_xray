    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is a masterclass in high-pathos manipulation. It utilizes a 'Bait and Switch' dynamic, starting with the joy of Palm Sunday only to plunge the listener into a state of existential dread and shame. By the time 'Mercy' is offered, the listener's Adult ego has been systematically bypassed in favor of a broken Adapted Child. The final appeal ('Christ weeps, my will is broken') is psychologically regressive, equating faith with the abandonment of personal agency.",

      "Over-reliance on shame and 'all-seeing eye' surveillance imagery.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult invitation for the listener to reflect or choose freely."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as capable Adults. Instead of telling them they are 'broken shells,' present the theological data and allow them to reach their own conclusions. Reduce the use of 'must' and 'shudder' to allow the Free Child to experience grace without the prerequisite of psychological crushing."
