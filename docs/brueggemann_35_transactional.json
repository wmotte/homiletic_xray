    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and promotes autonomy. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent (moralizing) and instead uses the Adult ego to frame a Free Child invitation to joy and mission. By acknowledging the 'legendary' and 'remote' nature of the text, the preacher respects the listener's Adult intelligence, creating a safe space for the Free Child to respond to the 'wind' of the Spirit. The focus on 'leaving off' failed antecedents is a healthy call to shed 'Script' behaviors in favor of 'Here-and-Now' responsiveness.",
    "strengths": [

      "Slight risk of institutional grandiosity (Nurturing Parent over-validation).",
      "The 'Search Committee in the sky' metaphor could be interpreted as a Critical Parent if the listener has a high 'Please Me' driver."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'Imagine' and 'Perhaps' to maintain the Adult-to-Adult contract. Ensure that the call to 'leave off' the past doesn't inadvertently trigger the 'Adapted Child's' fear of making a mistake."
