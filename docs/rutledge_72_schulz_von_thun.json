    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The 'Sache' is the sovereignty of God as the acting subject of history. The preacher provides a sharp exegetical focus on Deutero-Isaiah, contrasting the 'living God' with the 'impotent idols' of modernity and antiquity. The theological depth is high; it moves beyond mere information to a dogmatic claim about the nature of God's agency. By citing Paul Lehmann and referencing the distinction between intentional and permissive will, the preacher anchors the 'blue' side in a robust Reformed-Apocalyptic tradition. The clarity is exceptional because the central thesis—God as the grammatical and ontological subject—is maintained throughout the entire discourse.",
      "quotes": [
        "God is the subject of the sentences in the sermons. God is the subject of the verbs.",
        "The concept of the divine intrusion, or invasion, is fundamental to apocalyptic theology.",

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The grammatical metaphor (Subject/Verb) makes complex dogmatics accessible to the clergy audience."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a persona of 'the seasoned observer' and 'the concerned elder'. There is a transparent admission of frustration with the current state of mainline preaching. The 'green' side is used strategically to establish authority (the 'unique' experience of hearing many sermons) but also vulnerability (the story of the New York lunch). The self-revelation is largely diaconal, serving to highlight the crisis of faith in the church rather than to promote the preacher's ego. However, there is a palpable sense of 'theological weariness' regarding the 'urbane, progressive' wing of the church.",
      "quotes": [
        "I speak with a certain amount of authority when I say that there are a lot of clergy out there who give every impression of not believing in God.",

        "What saddened me was that my luncheon companion knew this."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Schizoid. The preacher exhibits a 'Compulsive' need for theological correctness and structural integrity (the 'Subject' must be God), combined with a 'Schizoid' distance that prioritizes the 'Sache' (the Truth) over harmonic 'Depressive' closeness with the 'urbane' peers.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is subservient; the preacher uses personal history to point toward the eclipse of God in the pulpit.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher/Mentor to Peers'. The preacher speaks 'to' the clergy, occasionally 'at' them, but softens the blow with the parenthetical 'I have never heard any of you preach'. The 'yellow' signal is one of 'Solidary Correction'. There is a 'we-definition' that includes the preacher in the American church's 'disarray', yet the preacher maintains a clear distance from the 'mainline' failures described. The tone is sober, slightly provocative, and authoritative. It challenges the listeners' professional integrity by asking if they actually believe in the God they preach.",
      "quotes": [
        "I can say these things to you because I have never heard any of you preach.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The appeal is not for moral 'doing' but for a 'metanoia' of the mind and the pulpit. The 'red' side demands a shift in homiletical focus: stop preaching 'spirituality' and start preaching 'God'. Theologically, this is a strong 'Anspruch' (demand) that is rooted in the 'Zuspruch' (promise) of God's own agency. The preacher avoids the 'moralistic trap' by making God the one who performs the work. The appeal is for the preacher to 'get out of the way' so that God can be the Subject. This is a sophisticated theological appeal that serves the Gospel rather than the Law.",
      "quotes": [
        "I quite seriously propose that a strong dose of Second Isaiah is what we all need.",

    "disruptions": "The main disruption is the 'Yellow' critique of the listeners' colleagues, which might trigger defensiveness.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a masterclass in 'Theocentric Homiletics'. It successfully utilizes the Schulz von Thun framework by aligning the 'Blue' factual content (God's sovereignty) with a 'Green' self-revelation of authentic concern. The preacher avoids the common pitfall of 'psychologizing' the faith—a danger Karl Barth warned against—by insisting that God is the Subject, not the object of our religious needs. While the 'Yellow' relational side is sharp and potentially bruising to the 'urbane' ego, it serves the 'Healing Disruption' necessary for a clergy audience. The 'Red' appeal is high-level: it does not ask for more 'work' but for more 'witness'. It is a sober, intellectually rigorous, and theologically 'congruent' piece of communication.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon is a direct antidote to psychologization. It explicitly rejects 'spirituality' as a substitute for the 'Living God'.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological precision regarding God's agency.",
      "Effective use of the 'Subject/Verb' metaphor.",
      "Congruence between the preacher's persona and the message."

    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Broaden the 'we' to reduce the 'Yellow' noise of perceived elitism.",
      "Unpack the 'God hides himself' section to provide more pastoral comfort for the 'Factual Ear'.",
      "Clarify the political applications to ensure they don't overshadow the 'Blue' theological core."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, authoritative sermon that prioritizes the 'Sache' of the Gospel over the 'Self' of the preacher or the 'Needs' of the audience. It achieves communicative integrity through its uncompromising focus on the Living God."
