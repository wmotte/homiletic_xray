    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a model of psychologically healthy homiletics. It avoids the common trap of using a public scandal to fuel a 'Critical Parent' or 'Ain't It Awful' game. Instead, the preacher uses an Adult-Adult transaction to deconstruct the 'Access' game played by religious leaders. By identifying as a 'fellow bad character,' he levels the hierarchy, preventing the congregation from slipping into a shamed 'Adapted Child' state. The psychological impact is one of empowerment through vulnerability.",

      "The transition from the President to the individual listener is a 'Bait and Switch' structurally, even if handled with integrity.",
      "Slight risk of 'Nurturing Parent' smothering by over-emphasizing 'unconditional love' as a buffer against the reality of judgment."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name the 'social' vs 'psychological' levels of the sermon as you did here. It prevents the listener from feeling 'tricked' by the shift in topic."
