    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The factual content is primarily exegetical in a psychological-existential sense. The preacher correctly identifies the historical-critical background (river demons, bandits) but quickly pivots to the 'Sache' of human transition. While Barth would demand the 'Living Christ' as the center, this sermon focuses on the 'Dark God' of the Old Testament. The theological depth is found in the rejection of a 'liberal error' (God as only nice), yet the 'blue' side remains thin on dogmatic structure. It operates more on the level of 'Erfahrungstheologie' (theology of experience) than on systematic revelation. The factual clarity is high, but the intellectual challenge for the 'factual ear' is moderate, as it prioritizes narrative over doctrine.",

      "comprehensibility_check": "Very high. The language is simple, using metaphors of rivers and transitions that are universally accessible."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the strongest side of the sermon. The preacher reveals significant personal vulnerability, sharing three distinct life stages: the loss of childhood innocence during the Holocaust (the glass vial of poison), the transition to adulthood, and the current fear of aging/death. This is not mere 'image management' but a deep 'Selbstenthüllung'. The 'I' is used as a bridge to the text. However, there is a risk that the preacher's biography overshadows the biblical Jacob. The authenticity is palpable, creating a high degree of credibility, though it borders on the 'Hysterical' type's need for self-expression, albeit disciplined by the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ich spüre dieses kalte Glas noch heute in meiner Hand. Ich hörte an diesem Tag auf, ein Kind zu sein.",
        "Ich habe Angst davor, älter zu werden. Ich habe Angst davor, verlassen zu werden.",

      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Hysterical/Depressive hybrid. Hysterical in the willingness to use the pulpit for intense personal narrative and emotional staging; Depressive in the deep longing for harmony, closeness, and the sharing of 'wishes' to avoid 'suffocating'.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' serves as a 'parable' for the congregation's experience, making it diaconal, though it occupies a large percentage of the 'airtime'.",
      "strengths": [
        "High level of vulnerability creates immediate trust.",
        "The stories are not 'heroic' but 'struggling', which fits the Jacob theme."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is one of 'Solidarity in Suffering'. The preacher speaks 'at eye level', frequently using 'we' and 'us' to include themselves in the struggle. There is no 'speaking from above'. However, the relationship noise arises from the intensity of the personal stories; a listener might feel 'obligated' to feel the preacher's pain or might feel their own struggles are less significant than hiding a Jewish woman from Nazis. The tone is pastoral and inviting, yet the constant focus on 'fear' and 'darkness' might feel heavy-handed for a listener seeking 'non-committal warmth'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ich möchte Ihnen eine kleine Geschichte von mir erzählen...",
        "Wir alle werden immer wieder überfallen...",

      "relationship_noise_check": "The use of 'we' can sometimes be presumptive ('We all have fear...').",

        "Vary the relational distance; sometimes the congregation needs a 'leader' rather than just a 'fellow sufferer'.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The appeal is centered on the 'struggle' (Anspruch) as a response to the 'blessing' (Zuspruch). The core appeal is: 'Do not let go until you are blessed.' This is a sophisticated theological appeal because it frames 'faith' not as a passive state but as an active, even 'impudent' (Dreistigkeit) wrestling. The preacher avoids moralism (doing good deeds) and focuses on the existential 'deed' of holding onto God. However, the final section pivots to political appeals (peace, justice, Soweto), which feels slightly disconnected from the intimate 'Jabbok' struggle established earlier. The ratio of Zuspruch (God is there in the dark) to Anspruch (You must wrestle) is well-balanced.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ich lasse dich nicht, du segnest mich denn. Das ist der größte Satz in dieser Geschichte.",

        "Mach uns hungrig nach dir lehr uns beten."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Strong. The demand to wrestle is rooted in the promise that God is 'wrestle-able' and ultimately seeks to bless.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Low on a personal level, but rises in the final political section where 'standing up' becomes the metric of faith.",
      "strengths": [
        "Transforms 'prayer' from a pious exercise into a vital struggle.",
        "Empowers the listener to be 'bold' with God."

        "The transition to 'political blocking' as prayer is a leap that might lose listeners focused on personal grief.",

  "congruence_and_disruptions": {
    "congruence_judgment": "Highly congruent. The preacher's tone, personal vulnerability, and the chosen text (Jacob's struggle) align perfectly. The 'brokenness' of the preacher's voice matches the 'limping' Jacob.",
    "dominant_side": "Green (Self-revelation)",
    "disruptions": "The main disruption is the shift from the 'internal' Jabbok to 'external' political activism at the end. It feels like two different sermons joined by the word 'struggle'.",
    "healing_disruption": "The 'healing disruption' occurs when the preacher attacks the 'liberal error' of a 'nice God'. This disrupts the listener's comfort and forces a confrontation with the 'Darkness of God'."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7,
    "summary": "This is a powerful, highly personal sermon that succeeds in making an ancient text existentially relevant. By utilizing the 'Green Side' (Self-revelation) as the primary vehicle, the preacher bridges the gap between the 'Blue' (Exegesis) and the 'Yellow' (Congregation). Theologically, it leans heavily on Rudolf Bohren's 'biographical preaching' and Gerrit Immink's focus on the 'encounter' in prayer. It avoids the 'Compulsive' trap of dogmatic rigidity but flirts with the 'Hysterical' trap of over-sharing. The Barthian 'Sache'—the sovereignty of God—is maintained by portraying God as the 'Attacker' who cannot be manipulated, though the Christological center is faint. The sermon's greatest strength is its 'congruence': the preacher 'limps' along with Jacob. The 'Appeal' is not a legalistic burden but a call to 'holy impudence'. However, the final jump to political ethics (Soweto, peace movements) feels like a homiletical 'add-on' that dilutes the concentrated power of the Jabbok metaphor. It is a 'Strong' sermon (7) because it dares to be vulnerable and rejects a cheap Gospel, even if it occasionally loses its theological focus in favor of psychological narrative.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a risk of 'anthropocentric' psychologization. God's action is largely mirrored through the preacher's 'feeling' of transitions. The 'Acting Subject' (God) is at times reduced to the 'Dread' felt by the human subject.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Exceptional authenticity and use of biography.",
      "Sharp theological distinction between 'cheap grace' and the 'Dark God'.",
      "Empowering 'Appeal' that redefines prayer as struggle."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Stronger Christological grounding to prevent the 'Dark God' from becoming a mere 'Fate'.",
      "Better integration of the political 'Appeal' into the existential 'Jabbok' framework.",
      "Reduce the 'Green' side slightly to allow the 'Blue' (Scripture) more independent space."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively honest and theologically serious sermon that uses psychological vulnerability to serve a prophetic message, though it occasionally prioritizes the 'I' over the 'Word'."
