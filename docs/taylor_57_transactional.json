    "psychological_health_score": 2,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically taxing. It utilizes a 'scarcity model' of grace, suggesting that God's presence is a fragile commodity that can be withdrawn if the listener's response is deemed 'shallow.' By moving from the Nurturing Parent to the Critical Parent, the preacher creates a 'double bind' where even empathy for Christ's suffering is criticized. This fosters dependency and religious anxiety rather than spiritual maturity.",

      "Heavy reliance on fear-based motivation (God's silence).",
      "Lack of an Adult-Adult invitation for the listener to process the text independently."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Stop using the 'threat of abandonment' as a homiletical tool. Instead of speaking for God in a Critical Parent voice ('God demands more'), speak from the Adult position about the implications of the text, allowing the listener to choose their response without the threat of psychological 'excommunication' via divine silence."
