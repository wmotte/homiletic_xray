    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon initiates with a high degree of concrete experience. It avoids abstract definitions of grief, opting instead for a visceral narrative of a widow's reaction to her husband's physical removal. This anchors the theological concept of 'body' in a recognizable, emotional human reality. The preacher effectively uses sensory details—warm hands, sobbing, the physical presence of a coffin—to ensure the hearer is not merely thinking about a topic but feeling the weight of the subject matter.",
      "quotes": [
        "My friend wept even more uncontrollably, saying, 'But it’s his body I want!'",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon moves into a sophisticated analysis of the human condition, specifically the 'confusion' regarding the body. It explores the tension between our obsession with physical appearance and our desire for 'out-of-body' spirituality. The preacher pauses to ask why we are so contradictory, identifying a cultural 'collective breakdown in values.' It successfully contextualizes the biblical problem (Gnosticism) by mirroring it with modern American trends (cremation, New Age spirituality).",
      "quotes": [
        "No wonder we are suffering from a collective breakdown in cultural values; we are being bombarded by contradictory messages from every side.",

There is a clear 'big idea': that God’s life appeared in a form that could be heard, seen, and touched. The sermon provides a logical defense of why the physical nature of Jesus is non-negotiable for Christian faith, contrasting Hebrew psychosomatic unity with Gnostic dualism.",
      "quotes": [

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase of the sermon. While the preacher mentions that faith has 'immediate and practical consequences,' the application remains largely internal or historical. The example of the Civil Rights movement is powerful but serves more as an illustration of faith's power than a concrete 'how-to' for the hearer. The call to 'embrace the wounded hands' is metaphorical rather than a specific ethical or behavioral action step.",

    "overall_kolb_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of Visionary preaching that grounds high theology in deep human experience. It fails, however, to provide the 'Active Experimentation' necessary for a complete Kolb cycle. The opening is effective in establishing a 'Concrete Experience' through the narrative of the widow, which leads naturally into a 'Reflective Observation' of cultural confusion regarding the body. The 'Abstract Conceptualization' is biblically sound, providing a clear defense of the Incarnation. However, the transition to 'Active Experimentation' is replaced by a return to 'Visionary' inspiration. The hearer is left with a beautiful image of the Resurrection but few concrete handles for daily life. The language is sober and the theological work is traceable, but the lack of pragmatic application limits its impact on adult learners who require 'doing' to reinforce 'thinking.'",

      "Maintain the high quality of Concrete Experience but ensure it leads to a specific 'Active Experimentation' task."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a well-crafted theological reflection that excels in the first three phases of Kolb’s cycle. It is particularly strong in creating a 'Visionary' atmosphere that challenges the hearer's worldview. However, from a homiletical perspective, it remains incomplete because it lacks a clear pragmatic response. The preacher successfully moves the hearer to 'see' and 'feel' the importance of the body, but stops short of helping them 'do' something with that insight. To move from a 6.5 to an 8, the sermon would need to sacrifice some of its visionary breadth for pragmatic depth, ensuring that the 'Resurrection of the body' results in specific, observable changes in how the congregation treats their own and others' physical lives."
