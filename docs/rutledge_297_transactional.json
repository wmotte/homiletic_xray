  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and exceptionally healthy. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent (moralizing) or the Smothering Nurturing Parent (sentimentalizing). By grounding the 'spiritual' in the 'physical,' the preacher validates the listener's human experience (Child) while demanding their intellectual engagement (Adult). It moves from a shared state of confusion to a grounded sense of hope without using manipulative 'switches' or guilt-inducing 'gimmicks.'",

      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to 'sexual ethics' is brief and could trigger a CP/AC transaction if not handled carefully, though here it remains brief and illustrative."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'we' pronoun to maintain symmetry. The use of logical analogies (the commando) is an excellent way to keep the listener in the Adult ego state."
