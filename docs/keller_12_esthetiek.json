[...] Spafford is looking at the cross, and that reorders the loves of his heart. He says, “If you’ve done this for me, there is nothing in heaven or on earth that I love more than you.” When you can say that, nothing will cast you down. Let us pray.",

    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The imagery is functional rather than evocative. Keller uses the biblical metaphors (slippery ground, foothold) as conceptual hooks rather than sensory experiences. He explains the metaphor of the 'foothold' by describing a staircase or mountain path, but the language remains somewhat clinical. There is a missed opportunity to 'paint the picture' of the sanctuary or the 'sleek bodies' of the wicked. The imagery serves the logic of the argument (didactic) rather than the imagination of the hearer (aesthetic). The 'brute beast' metaphor is handled with psychological precision but lacks the raw, sensory 'stench' that would make it a truly living image in the sense of Paul Scott Wilson.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you’re coming down a set of steps and you lose your foothold, you could get injured or die.",
        "Imagine you’re on a hiking tour and you’re under the trees... suddenly you notice there’s an outcropping of rock.",
        "If you went into the sanctuary in the temple of Jerusalem, you would have seen an altar caked with blood."

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Predominantly 'telling'. The images are used as illustrations for points rather than as the primary vehicle of revelation."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a hallmark of Keller’s style. The stewardship of language is high; he avoids 'Canaanite' jargon or explains it immediately (e.g., 'losing your foothold'). He is precise in distinguishing between 'sentiment' and 'emotion' and between 'using God' and 'serving God.' The language is economical and hits the core of the human condition (envy, self-absorption). He nuances the 'voice of God' with a characteristically sober Presbyterian disclaimer, showing a high level of intellectual honesty and care for the hearer's perception. Every word feels intentional, aimed at dismantling the hearer's defenses.",
      "quotes": [
        "I almost heard God say this. (By the way, I want you to know, since I’m a Presbyterian, I almost heard God say this.)",
        "Envy is wanting somebody else’s life... it sucks the joy out of the life you actually have.",

        "Could benefit from more varied vocabulary in the 'grace' section."

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is clearly 'oral' but not 'musical.' It has the rhythm of a lecture or a high-level conversation—staccato, logical, and repetitive for emphasis. There is little use of alliteration, assonance, or poetic parallelism. The cadence is driven by the 'logic of the heart' rather than the beauty of the sound. It is effective for teaching but lacks the 'sober beauty' or liturgical flow that makes a sermon stick through its sound value. It is very much 'paper language' that has been adapted for speech, rather than poetic prose.",

        "You’re confused. You don’t know what to do.",

        "Incorporate more rhetorical figures like parallelism to increase memorability.",
        "Vary sentence length more intentionally to create 'legato' moments of reflection.",
        "Reduce the 'lecture-style' signposting ('Point 1', 'Point 2') to allow for a more organic sound."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Oral language, but specifically 'teaching' language rather than 'poetic' or 'liturgical' language."
    },
    "average_score_language": 6.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'pedagogical aesthetics.' It excels in precision and stewardship (McEntyre), ensuring that the hearer understands the internal mechanics of the soul. However, it lacks the sensory 'imaging' (Wilson) and musicality that would elevate it to a work of art. The beauty lies in the clarity of the diagnosis rather than the texture of the words. It is a sober, Reformed aesthetic that prioritizes 'auditu' (hearing the truth) over 'visio' (seeing the beauty)."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with the 'upsetting of equilibrium'—the crisis of the believer who sees the wicked prosper. Keller maintains tension by delaying the 'turnaround' of verse 17. The movement from 'thinking about God' to 'dealing with God' serves as a strong dramaturgical pivot. However, the four-point structure at the end (admit, see, grasp, reorder) slightly flattens the narrative momentum into a list, though the final story of Horatio Spafford successfully brings the emotional arc to a high-stakes resolution.",
      "quotes": [
        "That’s one half of what’s wrong with his life... That’s only one half of his problem.",
        "The turnaround is in verse 17... All commentators on this passage say this is the turnaround.",
        "Spafford is looking at the cross, and that reorders the loves of his heart."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong 'upsetting' of the hearer's self-righteousness early on.",
        "The 'turnaround' is clearly marked and feels like a genuine discovery.",
        "The concluding story provides a powerful emotional 'catharsis'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition between the four points could be more organic and less like a numbered list.",
        "The 'Lead us not into temptation' connection feels slightly forced as a frame for Psalm 73.",
        "The energy dips slightly during the technical explanation of the Temple."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A hybrid: starts as a dynamic journey/plot, ends as a structured four-point application."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is where the sermon excels in 'Reframing' (Cilliers). Keller takes a 3,000-year-old poem and frames it within the modern experience of marketing, envy, and career anxiety. He respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the bloody altar) but synthesizes it with the psychological reality of 'using God.' He offers a new frame: your suffering isn't just a problem to be solved, but a revelation of your heart's true loves. This is a classic 'reframing' of reality in the light of grace.",
      "quotes": [
        "Partly because of marketing, partly because all advertisement is based on envy, we don’t see envy as terrible as it really is.",
        "You walk around New York City and there are all these big beautiful buildings... Is that what he’s talking about?",
        "Now we’ll know whether you got into the Christian faith to get me to serve you or for you to serve me."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant connection between ancient envy and modern advertising.",
        "The 'reframing' of suffering as a test of motive is profound and challenging.",
        "Seamless transition from the Old Testament sanctuary to the New Testament Christ."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could address the 'wicked' in more modern terms (e.g., systemic injustice) to broaden the context.",
        "The 'hitman' example is a bit of a 'contextual outlier' for a NYC professional congregation.",
        "More explicit connection to the 'Lead us not into temptation' petition would strengthen the frame."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing: reality is viewed through the lens of 'ordered loves' rather than 'circumstantial happiness'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is relatively 'closed' (monovalent). Keller provides a very specific, logical interpretation of the Psalm. While he invites the hearer to 'admit the worst,' the path to the solution is tightly scripted. There is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' (Stark) that might remain after the sermon; the Spafford story, while moving, acts as a 'happy ending' (in a spiritual sense) that resolves the tension. It is a 'witness' (Long) that is very sure of its testimony, which can sometimes feel coercive to a hearer still in the 'slippery places.'",
      "quotes": [
        "What is the resolution? What is the solution? ... The answer is a particular kind of prayer.",
        "I’ll tell you what the transformation is.",
        "When you can say that, nothing will cast you down."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The invitation to 'admit the worst' creates a psychological opening for the hearer.",
        "The sermon acknowledges the 'real griefs' of career reversal and loss.",
        "The use of 'we' instead of 'you' in the diagnosis of selfishness creates a shared space."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Allow for more 'open' questions at the end rather than a definitive 'nothing will cast you down.'",
        "Acknowledge that even in the 'sanctuary,' God can feel silent.",
        "Reduce the 'I'll tell you what this is about' phrasing to allow the hearer more interpretative space."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Closed work of art: a 'didactic-pastoral' system that seeks to provide a definitive answer."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are strong due to the clear narrative movement and the profound 'reframing' of the text for a modern audience. Keller understands the 'dramaturgy of the soul,' leading the hearer from self-pity to self-diagnosis to grace. However, the structure is somewhat 'sealed shut' by its own logical rigor. It functions more as a 'map' than a 'landscape'—it tells you exactly where to go rather than letting you wander through the sanctuary."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'cheap comfort' by insisting on the 'shocking shallowness' of the hearer's own heart. By calling the psalmist's (and hearer's) goodness 'pathetically self-centered,' Keller bypasses the sentimental 'God loves you' clichés. The use of the Spafford story is a risk, but because it is grounded in the loss of four children and the 'bloody altar,' it moves from sentiment to authentic emotion. It sustains the tension of 'morning punishments' before offering the 'shaft of light.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'hitman' example feels slightly like a 'pulpit cliché' to show God's extreme reach.",
      "The 'nothing will cast you down' ending borders on a 'happy ending' cliché."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission that 'I was a brute beast before you'—taking the animalistic nature of envy seriously.",
      "The distinction between 'using God' and 'loving God'—a sharp, non-kitsch diagnosis."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the sharp psychological edge; avoid the 'all-encompassing' promises at the end to keep the emotion grounded in the 'already/not yet' tension."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened through the 'vertical' intervention of the sanctuary and the cross. Keller successfully moves the sermon from a 'horizontal' moral struggle (trying to be good) to a 'vertical' reception of grace (God holding the hand). However, the space is slightly constricted by the 'pedagogical' tone—the grace is explained so thoroughly that the 'mystery' (Cilliers) of God's presence is sometimes replaced by a 'mechanic' of the gospel. The 'Space for Grace' is found in the 'yet' of verse 23, which Keller highlights effectively.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained for the first two-thirds, but resolved perhaps too neatly in the final five minutes.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of 'why bad things happen' is respected ('we don't know the reason'), but the mystery of God's presence is largely 'explained'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. The sermon explicitly deconstructs moralism ('I've been good, why is this happening?').",
    "recommendation": "Allow for a moment of silence or 'wonder' in the sanctuary section to let the 'Holy happen' (Immink) beyond the explanation."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "The sermon is an aesthetically coherent example of 'Apologetic-Pastoral' preaching. Its beauty lies in its 'sober simplicity' and 'intellectual precision.' It avoids the baroque excess of traditional rhetoric in favor of a 'transparent' style that aims to make the Gospel the primary object of beauty. While it scores lower on 'poetic' elements like imagery and musicality, it scores high on 'reframing' and 'anti-kitsch.' It is a sermon that 'shows' the internal workings of the heart even as it 'tells' the truths of the text. The aesthetic experience for the hearer is one of 'clarity' and 'relief'—the 'beauty of the truth' (Veritas) rather than the 'beauty of the form' (Pulchritudo).",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Profound 'Reframing' of ancient envy for a modern, consumerist context.",
      "High 'Anti-Kitsch' factor through rigorous self-diagnosis.",
      "Clear 'Narrative Arc' that moves from psychological crisis to theological resolution."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase sensory imagery to move from 'didactic' to 'imagistic' impact.",
      "Soften the 'lecture-style' structure to allow for more 'openness' and mystery.",
      "Enhance the musicality of the prose to better suit the 'oral event' of preaching."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Pedagogical-Diagnostic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing) and Paul Scott Wilson (Four Pages: Trouble/Grace), but lacks Ciska Stark's 'Openness'.",
    "audience_analysis": "Urban professionals, skeptics, and 'deconstructing' believers who value intellectual honesty and psychological depth over emotionalism.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'showing' the sanctuary through sensory description before explaining its function.",
      "Use more poetic parallelism in the 'reordering of loves' section to increase its 'weight'.",
      "Leave the final application slightly more open to allow the Holy Spirit 'space' to work in the hearer's specific context."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This is a 'strong' (7) sermon that serves as a model for 'Reframing' and 'Language Stewardship.' It successfully avoids the 'kitsch' of modern evangelicalism by maintaining a sharp, Reformed focus on the radicality of sin and the sufficiency of grace. Its aesthetic limitations (musicality, imagery) are likely intentional choices to serve its 'apologetic' function, but from a purely homiletic-aesthetic perspective, it remains more of a 'brilliant lecture' than a 'transformative work of art.' It opens space for grace, but does so with a very specific 'key'."
