It creates a psychological 'bind' where the listener's identity as a child of God is contingent upon performance. While it offers a 'low bar' for entry (a cup of water), the underlying logic is one of merit and proof rather than unconditional grace, potentially fostering a 'guilt-compliance' cycle in the listener.",
