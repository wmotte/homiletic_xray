  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a robust historical and exegetical framework, successfully bridging the gap between historical-critical methods and the pre-modern allegorical tradition. By citing the Venerable Bede and Richard Norris, the sermon establishes a high intellectual 'Sache'. The theological core—the 'living Christ' as the true Bridegroom—is clearly articulated through the lens of the Incarnation (the Word going 'outside'). The factual content is not merely informative but serves to rehabilitate a neglected hermeneutic, making the 'blue' side a vehicle for dogmatic depth. However, it occasionally borders on a lecture format, risking a 'fides quae' (doctrine) dominance over 'fides qua' (personal faith).",
      "quotes": [
        "The Venerable Bede... wrote several commentaries on the Song.",
        "The literal sense seems to be a celebration of the love between a man and woman.",
        "In the canon of Holy Scripture... the Song is included among the Wisdom books."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong integration of Church History (Bede, Herbert).",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates high authenticity by sharing personal history (youth ministry in the 70s) and her own long-term marriage. This 'green' side is 'diaconal'—it serves to ground the high theology in lived experience. There is a notable lack of 'image management'; she admits to the 'prodigious eros' of youth ministry and the 'sadness' of aging. Her self-revelation is not narcissistic but provides a 'living testimony' of the faithfulness she preaches. The 'I' is present but transparent, allowing the text to shine through her biography.",
      "quotes": [
        "I think of that work as without doubt one of the high points of my thirty-seven years.",
        "I am going to speak to you now as an elder, a woman who has been married... for nearly fifty years.",
        "I remember that young love very well. The intensity of it does not last."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive/Compulsive hybrid. She seeks harmony and connection (Depressive) through a structured, historically grounded framework (Compulsive). Her focus on 'long, faithful marriage' shows a high value on stability.",
      "diaconal_quality": "High. The personal anecdotes are used to illustrate the 'layered meaning' of the text, not to draw attention to the preacher's ego.",
      "strengths": [
        "Vulnerable yet dignified sharing of her own aging and marriage.",
        "Avoids the 'hysterical' trap of over-emotionalism."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The mention of 'seven years of psychoanalysis' is a brief 'leak' that could be expanded or better integrated."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Elder to Peers/Juniors'. The tone is maternal and authoritative ('I address you who are parents'). There is a strong 'We-definition' regarding the shared struggle against a 'transgressive' culture. However, the 'yellow' side occasionally carries a 'teaching from above' quality, common in academic settings, which might create distance for those struggling with failed marriages. The use of 'non-nerdy students' and 'cultural elite' creates an 'us vs. them' dynamic that strengthens the bond with the immediate audience but may feel exclusionary to outsiders.",
      "quotes": [
        "I address you who are parents of, or counselors to, young people.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon balances 'Anspruch' (the demand for fidelity/courage) with 'Zuspruch' (the grace of the Incarnation). The core appeal is not just 'be moral', but 'see human love as an image of God's covenant'. The 'red' side is most potent when she calls for 'courage' in an Ivy League context. Crucially, she avoids pure moralism by stating 'the grace of God is retroactive', which shifts the weight from human performance to divine Gift. The appeal is to 'rest' in the unconditional nature of God's love, though the call to 'lifelong marriage' remains a high bar.",
      "quotes": [
        "Dignity itself is a moral standard.",
        "The moral life has always required courage.",
        "Let us state without qualification that the grace of God is retroactive."

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The 'Zuspruch' (God's faithfulness) successfully provides the foundation for the 'Anspruch' (human faithfulness).",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Moderate. The emphasis on 'fifty years of marriage' and 'non-nerdy' students could feel like a law to those who have failed.",
      "strengths": [
        "The 'retroactive grace' comment is a vital theological safety valve.",
        "The appeal is grounded in the 'future restoration of all things'."

    "dominant_side": "Green (Self-revelation) and Blue (Factual) are equally dominant, creating a 'Personal-Academic' synthesis.",
    "disruptions": "A slight friction between the 'erotic wedding poems' (Blue) and the 'elderly companionship' (Green). The transition from 'ecstasy' to 'fading passion' is honest but disrupts the initial 'red' appeal of the Song's fire.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a strong, 'Ample Satisfactory' to 'Good' sermon that excels in the Hamburg school's requirement for congruence. The preacher (likely Sarah Coakley or similar profile) uses her own biography as a diaconal tool to make the 'blue' factual content of the Song of Songs accessible. Theologically, it follows a Barthian trajectory by making the 'Sache' (the Word made flesh) the center of the human experience of love. It avoids the 'hysterical' trap of over-sharing, maintaining a 'compulsive' (in the positive, structured sense) grip on church history and scripture. The tension between the 'erotic' text and the 'elderly' preacher is handled with grace, though the 'yellow' side's occasional elitism ('non-nerdy') slightly weakens the universal reach of the message. The sermon successfully moves from 'eros' to 'agape' without destroying the former, fulfilling the 'Bohren' ideal of a sermon that is both a work of art and a witness to the Spirit.",
    "barthian_warning": "Low risk. While she uses psychology (psychoanalysis, 'eros'), she consistently subordinates it to the 'Acting Subject' of God's covenant and the Incarnation.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Masterful integration of historical theology with personal narrative.",
      "Clear distinction between 'transgressive' culture and 'transcendent' love.",
      "Theological 'retroactive grace' as a counter-balance to moralism."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Soften the 'us vs. them' rhetoric regarding the 'cultural elite'.",
      "Bridge the gap between the 'erotic fire' of the text and the 'fading passion' of the application more dynamically.",
      "Ensure the 'Wisdom' section doesn't feel like a separate lecture."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively integral sermon that honors the text's complexity while providing a clear, Christological anchor for the congregation's life."
