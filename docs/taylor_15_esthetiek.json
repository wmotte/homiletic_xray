    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating a sensory landscape of the primeval garden. The preacher uses 'painting the picture' techniques to evoke a lost world, appealing to sight, sound, and touch. The imagery of 'lush foliage,' 'sparkling water,' and 'singing brooks' serves to establish the aesthetic baseline of 'ineffable beauty.' However, the imagery remains somewhat conventional—it leans on classical pastoral tropes rather than surprising, fresh metaphors. While effective in establishing mood, it occasionally flirts with the 'beautifying writing' that Grözinger warns against. The transition to the 'flaming sword' and 'brambles and briars' provides a necessary visual contrast, moving from the soft-focus of innocence to the sharp edges of reality. The use of Francis Thompson’s 'The Hound of Heaven' adds a sophisticated literary layer to the visual narrative of the flight from God.",

        "Lush foliage leapt out of the fertile soil everywhere. Flowers of dazzling beauty blossomed wherever the eye could turn.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is dignified and exhibits a high degree of 'stewardship' in the sense of McEntyre. There is a clear effort to avoid 'Canaanite jargon,' opting instead for a philosophical-poetic register. However, the precision suffers in the middle section where the preacher generalizes about the American past. Terms like 'simple prejudices' or 'bright dream' are rhetorically effective but lack the analytical precision required to do justice to the 'complexity of human experience' mentioned in the criteria. The word choice is elevated, almost liturgical, which provides a sense of authority but occasionally obscures the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed tradition with a more Romantic, expansive vocabulary. The sentence structures are balanced and deliberate, showing a preacher who cares deeply for the weight of words.",

        "It is the notion of paradise lost, so deeply textured in the reflections of people of almost all origins.",
        "The serpent, the personification of evil, is not at the outset ugly and repulsive. There is a subtle grace and an initial attractiveness.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest micro-aesthetic strength. The text is clearly written for the ear, utilizing classical rhetorical devices such as anaphora ('On ahead...'), alliteration ('lost rapture as a result of rupture'), and parallelism. The cadence is magisterial, moving with a 'deliberate speed' that mirrors the poem it quotes. The repetition of 'Eden was an ineffably beautiful place' acts as a musical refrain, grounding the first movement of the sermon. The variation in sentence length—from the long, flowing descriptions of the garden to the staccato 'We know better'—creates a dynamic listening experience. It avoids 'paper language' entirely, sounding like a living performance even on the page. The rhythm supports the movement from the nostalgic past to the urgent future.",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high level of micro-aesthetic quality, characterized by a Romantic, literary sensibility. It prioritizes the creation of a 'mood' through rhythmic prose and vivid, if somewhat traditional, imagery. The preacher acts as a 'steward of language' by avoiding jargon and employing a dignified, universal vocabulary. While it occasionally leans toward decorative language, the musicality and oral flow are exceptional, making the text feel like a performance of 'sober beauty' that honors the aesthetic turn's emphasis on the sensory power of the Word."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' as described by Lowry. It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium'—the vague awareness that things are not as they should be. It moves from the 'rapture' of the past to the 'rupture' of the present. The turning point is the realization that 'we cannot go back,' symbolized by the flaming sword. This creates a necessary tension: if we cannot go back to innocence, where do we go? The movement toward Gethsemane and the 'New Eden' provides the resolution. The dramaturgy is effective because it links the cosmic story of Genesis with the national story of America and the personal story of the individual. However, the resolution in the final paragraph feels a bit hurried and 'sunny' compared to the 'titanic glooms' described earlier.",
      "quotes": [
        "There lingers on the edge of human memory a mood... that once somewhere things were far better than they are now.",
        "The past is a closed garden. A flaming sword swings to and fro before its gates. We cannot go back.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon attempts a bold 'reframing' in Cilliers' sense, using the Genesis narrative to interpret the social and political 'loss of innocence' in 20th-century America. The connection between the 'forbidden area' and the 'fatal weakness' of human desire for power is well-made. However, the integration feels somewhat 'pasted on' when it moves to the specific American context ('In this country, the old, simple prejudices...'). The 'strangeness' of the biblical text is somewhat smoothed over to fit a national narrative of progress and faith. While it avoids being a mere springboard, the synthesis between the 'New Jerusalem' imagery and American 'righteousness' is a bit too seamless, potentially losing the critical edge of the biblical 'otherness.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Does this ancient account explain our plight?",
        "In this country, the old, simple prejudices and preferences will never again work.",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's weakest structural point. While it starts as an 'open work of art' by tapping into universal moods and half-thoughts, it becomes increasingly 'closed' and prescriptive toward the end. The final paragraph, with its directives ('So don't look back. Look ahead!'), leaves little room for the hearer's own appropriation of the 'long and arduous way.' The complexity of the 'brambles and briars' is quickly traded for a 'sunny' resolution. According to Stark's criteria, the sermon 'seals' the meaning of the New Eden rather than leaving it as a polyvalent space for the hearer to inhabit. The 'ambivalence of existence' acknowledged in the middle is largely resolved by the end.",
      "quotes": [
        "We can never go back now. We can never go back to the place where we believe that all people are kind and just.",

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Starts as an open work of art but moves toward a closed, monovalent conclusion."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon possesses a strong narrative arc that effectively moves the hearer from nostalgia to a call for mature faith. It utilizes the 'Homiletical Plot' to create tension through the image of the 'closed garden.' However, the integration of the biblical text with the American social context is sometimes forced, and the structure becomes overly 'closed' in its conclusion. While it successfully 'reframes' the concept of Eden, it misses the opportunity to remain in the 'space of the between,' opting instead for a somewhat predictable and moralistic resolution that limits the hearer's interpretive freedom."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 5,
    "analysis": "The sermon sits on a knife-edge regarding kitsch. The first half avoids kitsch by acknowledging the 'rupture' and 'transgression' with gravity. However, the description of Eden ('Brooks sang soft songs,' 'Flowers of dazzling beauty') flirts with 'religious kitsch'—the pre-chewed, idealized imagery of a world that never was. The conclusion is where kitsch most prominently appears: the 'sun is shining' and 'flowers are blooming' on ahead. This offers a 'happy ending' that risks trivializing the 'racist prejudices' and 'arduous way' mentioned earlier. It moves too quickly to 'comfort' without fully sustaining the 'pain of suffering.' The 'sentiment' of the ending threatens to overwhelm the 'authentic emotion' of the middle section.",

      "The use of 'The Hound of Heaven' to describe the terrifying persistence of God."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To increase depth, the preacher should ground the 'New Eden' in the 'scars' of Gethsemane. Instead of 'flowers blooming,' describe the 'healing of the nations' as a costly, complex process that involves the 'leaves' of the tree, not just the 'sunshine'."

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is opened by the rejection of 'legalism' and the move toward 'faith' and 'grace' as the 'new adequacy.' Cilliers' concept of 'reframing' is present: the preacher tries to shift the hearer's gaze from a lost past to a God-given future. However, the space is partially closed by the 'moralization' of the American role ('Woe to us if we fail him'). The 'mystery' of the New Eden is somewhat explained away by equating it with 'mature wisdom' and 'confidence in the Lord,' which, while theologically sound, can feel like a 'dogmatically sealed' solution. The 'Space for Grace' is most palpable in the middle section where the 'unhurrying chase' of God is described—here, the 'Holy' is allowed to be unavailable and pursuing.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained well in the middle (the 'arduous way'), but cheaply resolved in the final three sentences.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the Fall is respected; the mystery of the New Eden is somewhat over-explained.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the theology, but moralization ('we must go on,' 'don't look back') dominates the application.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'New Eden' to remain a 'vision' (apocalyptic) rather than a 'program' (moralistic). Use the 'Space for Grace' to let the hearer sit with the 'adequacy of Christ' amidst the 'brambles'."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.3,
    "summary": "The sermon 'Eden Beyond Innocence' is an aesthetically sophisticated piece of homiletic art that leans heavily on the 'Poetics of Language.' Its primary strength lies in its musicality and its ability to evoke a powerful 'mood' through rhythmic, elevated prose. It successfully employs the 'aesthetic turn' by using the Genesis narrative not as a dry dogmatic proof-text, but as a living 'optics' through which to view human and national experience. The preacher functions as a 'witness' to a lost beauty and a coming grace. However, the sermon suffers from a tendency toward 'religious kitsch' in its more sentimental descriptions and its overly tidy conclusion. While it opens space for grace by moving beyond simple moralism, it partially closes that space with a prescriptive, 'sunny' ending that does not fully honor the 'arduous way' it correctly identifies. It is a sermon of 'sober beauty' that occasionally lapses into 'beautifying writing,' yet it remains a compelling example of how narrative and imagery can 'reframe' reality for a congregation in crisis.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional oral rhythm and rhetorical cadence.",
      "Effective use of literary and biblical imagery to create a sensory 'world'.",
      "Strong narrative arc that moves from nostalgia to mature faith."

      "Reduction of sentimental/kitsch imagery in the description of the 'New Eden'.",
      "Greater openness in the conclusion to allow for hearer appropriation.",
      "More precise integration of social context to avoid 'pasted-on' applications."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Poetic-Imagistic with a Narrative-Dramatic structure.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson and the 'Reframing' phenomenology of Johan Cilliers.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to hearers who value literary depth, historical-national reflection, and a dignified, non-jargon-heavy spiritual tone.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'staccato' language to ground the 'legato' poetic passages.",
      "Practice 'showing' the New Eden through concrete acts of 'healing' rather than general 'sunshine'.",
      "Trust the 'open ending'—let the 'flaming sword' or the 'river of life' be the final word."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Through the lens of homiletic aesthetics, this sermon is a 'strong' (7) performance of language but a 'mediocre' (5) example of structural openness. It succeeds in 'reframing' the human condition but fails to fully resist the lure of kitsch in its resolution. It serves as a valuable example of how the 'Aesthetic Turn' can elevate a sermon from a lecture to an 'event,' provided the preacher remains vigilant against the 'happy ending' that closes the space for true grace."
