  "aristotelian_modes_analysis": {
    "logos": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The rational architecture of this sermon is exceptionally strong and serves as its primary engine. The preacher employs a clear four-point deductive structure (Believe, Understand, Submit, Live) that is introduced early and followed strictly. The logic is built on a sophisticated 'paradigm case study' approach, using Peter as the logical bridge between the biblical text and the hearer's experience. The preacher also utilizes historical-critical arguments (referencing Richard Bauckham) to establish the reliability of the text, appealing to the hearer's intellect before moving to the heart. The transition between the 'shame culture' of the first century and modern 'individualistic culture' is handled with logical precision, ensuring the argument remains traceable for a contemporary audience.",
      "quotes": [
        "Here are the four principles we’ll learn here. If you want to encounter the risen Christ, you have to believe in the resurrection’s reality, you have to understand its achievement, you have to submit to its pattern, and you have to live its life.",
        "Richard Bauckham says this must have come from Peter himself or it would not be in there. Nobody would have made it up. It happened, but even if it happened, it would not be in there unless this was Peter’s eyewitness account.",
        "The resurrection is your proof that it was all paid for. That’s the reason why written into the foundation documents of the Christian church is that it’s not strong people who are saved... That is not how Christianity works at all."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Exceptional structural clarity with a clearly defined 'thread' throughout the entire message.",
        "Use of external scholarly evidence (Bauckham) to bolster the rational credibility of the resurrection accounts.",
        "Effective use of contrast (Jesus as moral exemplar vs. Jesus as substitute) to clarify theological definitions."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition into the fourth point ('Live its life') feels slightly rushed compared to the extensive historical grounding of the first point.",
        "The use of Greek word studies (poimainō) is helpful but could be more concisely integrated into the narrative flow.",
        "The 'Costco receipt' analogy, while clear, slightly lowers the intellectual tone established by the previous scholarly references."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The Logos is the sermon's greatest strength, characterized by a 'Teaching-Instructional' logic that prioritizes clarity and traceability."
    },
    "pathos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Pathos is achieved through vivid 'slices of life' and sensory imagery rather than emotional manipulation. The preacher uses the 'fire' as a recurring sensory anchor, connecting the cold courtyard of denial to the warm beach of restoration. The inclusion of Joni Eareckson Tada’s quote provides a high degree of affective resonance, moving the abstract concept of 'new bodies' into the realm of tangible human longing. The preacher also uses direct address ('It’s supposed to change you and me') to bridge the distance. However, the emotional tone remains somewhat controlled and academic, leaning more toward 'head-pathos'—understanding why something is moving rather than purely experiencing the emotion itself.",
      "emotional_tone": "The dominant tone is one of 'Sober Hope'—a mixture of the seriousness of failure and the quiet joy of restoration.",
      "quotes": [
        "I, with shriveled, bent fingers, atrophied muscles, gnarled knees, and no feeling from the shoulders down, will one day have a new body...",
        "Imagine Peter seeing the Lord who he denied and betrayed... He’s coming to see Jesus, and Jesus says, 'Hey! Let’s sit down by the fire.' Peter says, 'A fire? Are you trying to rub my nose in it?'",
        "He said, 'I’m an Englishman. I’m a bachelor. Somebody take me to a pub... Who will deliver me from this body of death?'"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong use of sensory details (the smell of the fire, the taste of the fish) to make the biblical narrative palpable.",
        "Effective use of humor (the Dick Lucas story) to lower the audience's defenses before delivering a challenging application.",
        "Deep empathy for the 'lambs'—the people in the congregation who feel like failures or who are suffering."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The emotional climax of Peter's weeping in the courtyard could be given more space to breathe before moving into the 'four principles'.",
        "The tone is occasionally too clinical when discussing 'shame and honor cultures', which can distance the hearer from the raw emotion of Peter's betrayal.",
        "The conclusion is somewhat abrupt; a more evocative closing image would strengthen the final affective impact."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Pathos is effective but secondary to Logos; it serves to illustrate the logic rather than drive the sermon independently."
    },
    "ethos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher’s Ethos is established through intellectual humility and a 'witness' stance rather than personal vulnerability. He does not share his own failures extensively, but he aligns himself with the 'moral failure' of Peter, using 'we' and 'us' frequently. The Ethos is that of a 'Reliable Guide' or 'Wise Teacher' who has done the hard work of studying the evidence. The inclusion of the Dick Lucas story functions as a 'proxy-vulnerability'—the preacher uses another's struggle to illustrate a point he likely shares, which is effective but slightly less courageous than direct personal testimony. The authority is clearly derived from the Text and the Gospel logic rather than personal charisma.",
      "authenticity": "The preacher shows high intellectual honesty but maintains a professional distance, acting more as a theological interpreter than a vulnerable witness.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s almost comical I’m going to try to cover all of those principles so briefly, but let’s look at each one...",
        "I actually believe all Christians, especially in the Western world, cannot just say, 'Well, I was raised believing that.'... you’re going to have to do the hard work.",
        "Unless I admit I’m a moral failure who is completely saved by grace, I won’t have the desire... to care for people."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Avoids the 'ivory tower' by acknowledging the difficulty of belief in a skeptical Western context.",
        "Projects a sense of spiritual depth through the nuanced handling of 'ordered loves' and Augustinian theology.",
        "The preacher’s conviction is evident in the firm rejection of 'moralism' in favor of 'grace'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The preacher could increase Ethos by sharing a brief, concrete moment of his own 'fire'—a personal experience of failure or restoration.",
        "The tone is occasionally a bit 'lecturing' ('Let me just tell you a couple of things about the Greek words'), which can create a hierarchy between pulpit and pew.",
        "More explicit identification with the 'man curved in on himself' would strengthen the sense of shared humanity."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Ethos is solid and credible, rooted in intellectual integrity and theological consistency, though it lacks raw personal vulnerability."

  "rhetorical_balance_analysis": {
    "dominant_mode": "Logos",
    "suppressed_mode": "Ethos",
    "balance_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a highly effective example of a 'Teaching Sermon' where Logos provides the skeleton and Pathos provides the flesh. The balance is slightly tilted toward the rational (Logos), as the preacher spends significant time on historical evidence and theological definitions. Pathos is used strategically to illustrate these points, particularly through the stories of Joni Eareckson Tada and Dick Lucas. Ethos is the most 'quiet' of the three; while the preacher is clearly credible, he remains behind the argument rather than in front of it. The three modes reinforce each other well: the logic makes the emotion 'safe' (not manipulative), and the emotion makes the logic 'urgent'.",
    "consequences_of_imbalance": [
      "Intellectually oriented hearers will be highly satisfied and convinced by the rigorous argumentation.",
      "Hearers seeking a raw, emotional 'encounter' might find the four-point structure a bit too restrictive or clinical.",
      "The lack of personal vulnerability from the preacher might make the 'death of self' application feel more like a theoretical requirement than a shared journey."
    ],
    "recommendation_for_balance": "To achieve an 8 or 9 in balance, the preacher should reduce the time spent on historical evidence (Bauckham) and increase personal 'witness' (Ethos) regarding the 'reordering of loves' in his own life."

    "orthodoxy_logos": {
      "score": 9,
      "analysis": "The sermon is doctrinally precise, emphasizing substitutionary atonement, the physical resurrection, and the necessity of grace over moralism."
    },
    "orthopathy_pathos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon successfully awakens a sense of 'God-fearing joy' and hope, particularly for the suffering, though it remains somewhat cognitively mediated."

    "orthopraxy_ethos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher calls for a life of 'tenderness and courage,' and while he speaks with integrity, the personal 'praxis' of the preacher is more implied than demonstrated."
    }
  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_rhetorical_score": 7,
    "summary": "This is a high-quality, intellectually rigorous sermon that excels in its logical architecture and theological clarity. The preacher successfully navigates the difficult task of connecting a historical event (the Resurrection) to the internal psychological and spiritual state of the hearer. By using Peter as a 'case study,' the sermon avoids becoming a dry lecture, though it retains a strong instructional tone. The use of external sources and cultural analysis makes the message particularly effective for a modern, skeptical, or educated audience. While the Pathos is strong in its illustrations, the sermon's primary power lies in its ability to dismantle 'moralism' and replace it with a 'grace-based' logic of growth. The Ethos is professional and credible, providing a stable platform for the message, even if it lacks the raw vulnerability found in more 'narrative' homiletical styles.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Clear, traceable four-point structure that aids listener retention.",
      "Sophisticated integration of historical evidence and theological depth (Augustine, Bauckham).",
      "Effective use of 'proxy' stories (Tada, Lucas) to create emotional resonance."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase personal vulnerability to move from 'Teacher' to 'Witness'.",
      "Allow more space for the emotional weight of the biblical narrative to land before moving to analysis.",
      "Streamline the historical-critical section to allow more time for the 'Live its life' application."
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Rational-Declarative with Narrative Illustrations",
    "audience_analysis": "Most appealing to 'Head-to-Heart' listeners—those who need to be intellectually convinced before they allow themselves to be emotionally moved.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Try a 'Low-Logos' approach where the structure is hidden within a single narrative arc to increase Pathos.",
      "Incorporate a personal 'failure' story to strengthen Ethos and model the 'death-resurrection' pattern.",
      "Use more 'direct address' in the application phase to move from 'theology of growth' to 'call to grow'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a robust example of the 'New Homiletic' filtered through a Reformed, intellectual lens. It scores a 7/10 overall because it is far above average in its clarity and depth, yet it remains slightly too 'safe' in its rhetorical distance to be considered a 9/10 'model' of the Rhetorical Triangle. It successfully serves the 'head' and 'heart,' providing a clear path for the 'hands' (orthopraxy), making it a highly effective piece of ecclesiastical communication."
