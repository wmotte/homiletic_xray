    "summary": "This is a remarkably healthy sermon from a TA perspective. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, inviting the listener into a mature, reality-tested faith. It identifies and rejects common religious 'Games'—specifically the psychological game of labeling others as 'weeds' to feel like 'wheat.' By admitting her own limitations and presenting a 'mingled' view of humanity, the preacher fosters autonomy and authentic connection rather than dependency or guilt.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' language to maintain the Adult-Adult level and keep the 'Nurturing Parent' grounded in the 'Adult' reality of suffering to avoid sentimentality."
