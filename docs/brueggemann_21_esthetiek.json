    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in 'painting the picture' of the city through the lens of Isaiah. It avoids abstract urban planning jargon in favor of visceral, sensory metaphors. The transition from the 'faithful city' to the 'whore' is handled with poetic grit, moving from sexual infidelity to economic corruption (silver as waste ore, wine watered down). Brueggemann uses 'imagery' not as decoration, but as a diagnostic tool to help the hearer 'see' the decay of the social fabric. The use of the 'street gang' and 'localism' imagery provides a contemporary bridge to the ancient 'Judges' period, making the theological concept of regression palpable. It follows Wilson's 'show, don't tell' by describing the stench of the 'tramp-city' rather than just lecturing on social injustice.",
      "quotes": [
        "The lady has become a tramp... the gentleman has become a paramour, seeking satiation.",
        "Silver becomes waste ore, wine cheapened with water.",
        "A brand of localism that sounds like street gangs, localism in tension with other localisms."

        "Could further develop the sensory details of the 'afterward' to match the vividness of the 'therefore'.",
        "The 'widow and orphan' image is central but could be even more concretized in a 20th-century urban setting.",
        "Introduction of the 'black male' at the end is vital but lacks the poetic development of earlier metaphors."

    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise and avoids 'Canaanite' jargon, opting instead for a 'stewardship of language' that honors the biblical text's own vocabulary (justice, righteousness, fidelity). Brueggemann is careful to define his terms through the poem rather than through systematic theology. He avoids the pitfall of partisan political language by subsuming 'George and Bill' under the larger theological categories of 'regression' and 'exploitation.' Every word feels intentional, particularly the repetition of 'therefore' and 'afterward,' which function as linguistic pillars. However, some phrases like 'technical fix' or 'infrastructure of fidelity' lean slightly toward academic-sociological prose, though they are used with enough rhetorical force to remain effective.",
      "quotes": [
        "The city is not just a political engine... it is a theological entity.",
        "What is required is a new gift of God’s grace that is promised, and a fresh embrace of covenantal fidelity.",

        "Ensure the term 'fidelity' doesn't become a repetitive catch-all without specific local examples."

      "jargon_analysis": "Theological jargon is largely absent; biblical keywords are 'reframed' as active social realities."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a distinct rhythmic cadence, characterized by the 'Brueggemannian' style of repetition and parallelism. The movement between 'Therefore' and 'Afterward' creates a liturgical beat that mirrors the 'upsetting of equilibrium' and its subsequent resolution. The sentences vary in length, using short, punchy declarations ('Therefore God...') to punctuate longer, more descriptive passages. There is a palpable 'flow' that suggests this was written for the ear, utilizing the rhetorical power of the 'thrice-repeated' phrase and the dramatic pause. The use of alliteration and the rhythmic listing of 'no more...' at the end creates a poetic crescendo that elevates the text from a lecture to a performance.",
      "quotes": [
        "Once so faithful, now so fickle, once so committed, now so self-gratifying.",
        "Therefore... Therefore says the Sovereign... Therefore God...",

        "The middle section on the 'Book of Judges' slows the rhythmic momentum slightly with historical explanation.",
        "Some parenthetical asides ('holy as it is') interrupt the cadence.",
        "The conclusion could benefit from a final, singular rhythmic 'hook' to anchor the 'afterward'."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Strongly oral language; the text functions as a script for a rhetorical event."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The language is rhetorically sophisticated, utilizing the 'poetic power' advocated by Grözinger. It avoids the 'Canaanite' dialect of the church while maintaining deep biblical resonance. The imagery is visceral and diagnostic, effectively 'showing' the decay of the city rather than merely 'telling' the congregation to be better. The musicality of the prose, particularly the rhythmic use of 'Therefore' and 'Afterward,' ensures that the sermon functions as a performative event rather than a static document. It demonstrates a high level of 'stewardship of language' by treating words as instruments of truth and reframing."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with the jarring image of the faithful city turned whore. The structure is tripartite but dynamic: I. The Mess (The Problem), II. The Therefore (The Crisis/Judgment), and III. The Afterward (The Grace/Resolution). This is not a static list of points but a 'journey from A to B.' The tension is maintained by refusing to offer a 'cheap' political solution (Bill or George), instead pushing the tension into the 'theological crisis' of God's intervention. The turning point is the 'big, deep breath' at the introduction of 'Afterward,' shifting the energy from judgment to hope without losing the weight of the preceding sections.",
      "quotes": [
        "The poem begins by plunging us into an honest notice of the mess in the city.",
        "Therefore God... The holy purpose of God intrudes upon the city.",
        "Then the poet takes a big, deep breath... Afterward."

      "strengths": [
        "Clear movement from 'trouble' to 'grace' (Wilson's Four Pages).",
        "The 'Afterward' functions as a genuine dramaturgical resolution, not just a conclusion.",

        "The transition from the 'mess' to the 'therefore' could be more sudden to increase the shock of the 'intrusion'.",
        "The connection to the 'Book of Judges' is a bit long and risks losing the narrative thread of the 'City'.",
        "The final paragraph returns to 'Bill or George' which, while grounding, slightly dissipates the transcendent energy of the 'Afterward'."

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 9,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. It is a masterclass in Cilliers' 'reframing.' Brueggemann takes the ancient text of Isaiah and uses it as a lens to look at the 1992 American election and urban crisis. He respects the 'strangeness' of Jerusalem while showing how its story is 'the long-term story of every major city.' The synthesis is organic; the 'widows and orphans' are not just ancient figures but the 'measure of the health' of New Haven or Atlanta. He reframes the city from a 'political engine' to a 'theological entity,' forcing the hearer to see their contemporary reality in a completely new light. The integration is so tight that the text and context become a single 'inter-esse' space.",
      "quotes": [
        "He thinks always about the city of Jerusalem... and when we think of other cities, we imagine all our other cities.",
        "Viewed theologically, every city behaves and has a story to tell, not unlike that of Jerusalem.",
        "I suspect that George and Bill still belong to the season of regression."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Profound 'reframing' of the city as a theological actor.",
        "Honors the 'then' of Isaiah while making it urgently 'now'.",
        "Avoids the 'springboard' effect where the text is left behind for the context."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could include more specific 'contextual' markers of the city's 'whoredom' to match the biblical 'dross'.",
        "The 'black male' mention feels a bit late and could be integrated more deeply into the Isaianic framework.",
        "More explicit connection between 'repentance' and specific city policies would sharpen the 'reframing'."

      "reframing_present": "Strongly present; the sermon offers a radical new frame for urban reality."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon functions as an 'open work of art' (Stark) by refusing to provide a 'technical fix' or a partisan endorsement. It leaves the 'Afterward' as a space to be 'received as God gives,' which invites the hearer into a state of active waiting and resolve. It acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence'—the reality of street brutality and greed—without resolving it cheaply. However, the rhetorical force is so strong that it occasionally borders on 'monovalence'; the preacher's interpretation of the 'therefore' is quite authoritative. Yet, the ending is an invitation to 'resolve' rather than a prescriptive 'to-do' list, leaving room for the hearer to step into the 'afterward' in their own context.",
      "quotes": [
        "The afterward is out of our hands... you cannot rush it, and you cannot program it.",
        "We believe the 'therefore' is not the last word... We believe, even here, in the 'afterward'.",
        "That reembrace of fidelity can and will permeate any concrete decision."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Ends with an open invitation to 'resolve' and 'trust' rather than a moralistic checklist.",
        "Leaves space for the 'mystery' of God's timing.",
        "Treats the hearer as a 'mature conversation partner' who must navigate the 'between'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'therefore' section is so definitive it might leave some hearers feeling 'overwhelmed' rather than 'invited'.",
        "Could leave more room for the 'doubt' of those who don't yet see the 'afterward'.",
        "The conclusion is slightly 'sealed' by the certainty of the 'future is indeed sure'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily an open work, though the prophetic tone carries a high degree of rhetorical authority."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 8.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is exceptional, particularly in its 'reframing' of the city. The sermon moves with a clear narrative arc from the 'mess' of the present to the 'afterward' of God's promise. It avoids the static 'three-point' structure in favor of a dynamic journey through the 'ecology' of the city. By integrating the ancient text of Isaiah with the contemporary post-election context, it creates a space where the 'holy happens' (Immink). It successfully sustains the tension between the 'already' of the mess and the 'not yet' of the newness, opening a significant 'space for grace'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'pre-chewed emotions' and 'cheap solutions.' Brueggemann refuses to give a 'happy ending' based on the election results, instead labeling both candidates as part of the 'season of regression.' He takes the 'pain of suffering' (infant mortality, street brutality) seriously, allowing the 'therefore' of judgment to have its full, uncomfortable weight before moving to hope. There is no 'sentimentality' here; the 'afterward' is a 'staggering' and 'terrible' newness, not a cozy comfort. The emotion is authentic because it is rooted in the 'brutality' of the city and the 'rage' of God, rather than clichéd religious platitudes.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None identified; the sermon actively deconstructs the 'kitsch' of political platforms as technical fixes.",
      "Avoids the 'Jesus is the answer' cliché by focusing on the 'Holy Actor's' judgment and promise."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The 'big, deep breath' before the 'afterward'—acknowledging the exhaustion of the 'binge of self-indulgence'.",
      "The admission that 'George and Bill' are penultimate and likely part of the problem."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'sober beauty' by continuing to resist the urge to provide immediate, 'packaged' comfort."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by the radical 'reframing' of the city's destiny. By moving the focus from human 'technical fixes' to God's 'afterward,' Brueggemann creates a 'space for grace' (Cilliers) that is not dependent on political success. He sustains the tension between the 'therefore' of current reality and the 'afterward' of God's promise, refusing to resolve the 'urban crisis' through human effort alone. The 'mystery' of God's timing is respected ('you cannot rush it'). However, the strong emphasis on 'repentance' as a 'socioeconomic political' act brings in an element of 'task,' but it is framed as a 'reembrace' of a gift already promised, thus keeping grace primary.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between the 'dog-eat-dog localism' and the 'city of righteousness' is held until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, the 'afterward' is described as 'authorized by God' and 'out of our hands'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails as the 'new gift' that enables the 'resolve' of the people.",
    "recommendation": "To open even more space, the preacher could dwell slightly longer on the 'unavailability' of the 'afterward' to further decenter human agency."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 8.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the 'Prophetic-Reframing' style. Its primary strength lies in its ability to take an ancient, 'strange' biblical text and use it to completely reframe a contemporary, high-stakes context (a presidential election). The language is 'stewarded' with precision, avoiding clichés and religious kitsch in favor of visceral imagery and rhythmic power. The sermon functions as an 'event' (Immink) that moves the hearer from the 'mess' of the city through the 'therefore' of judgment to the 'afterward' of grace. It avoids the 'closedness' of a political lecture by insisting that the city's future is a theological 'mystery' that must be received as a gift. The 'sober beauty' of the prose and the 'dramaturgical arc' of the structure work together to create a space where the 'Holy Actor' can be noticed. It is a model of how 'form is content,' as the rhythmic movement of the text itself enacts the 'ecology' of the city it describes.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the city from a political to a theological entity.",
      "Rhythmic and musical use of language, particularly the 'Therefore/Afterward' dialectic.",
      "Complete avoidance of religious kitsch and cheap political sentimentality."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Concretize the 'afterward' imagery to be as sensory as the 'mess' imagery.",
      "Streamline the 'Book of Judges' historical section to maintain narrative momentum.",
      "Integrate modern urban victims (like the 'black male') more deeply into the poetic structure."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Imagistic / Reframing",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Four Pages).",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers looking for depth beyond partisan politics; those who appreciate 'sober beauty' and intellectual/theological challenge.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an even more 'open' ending to allow the 'afterward' to resonate longer.",
      "Use more 'staccato' rhythm in the 'therefore' section to mirror the 'street brutality' described.",
      "Incorporate a 'moment of silence' or a liturgical pause after the 'big, deep breath'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically superior work that demonstrates the power of the 'aesthetic turn.' It does not 'beautify' the message but uses form to reveal the radical nature of the Word. By resisting kitsch and moralization, it opens a genuine 'space for grace' in the midst of a 'messy' urban reality. It is a strong 8.2, serving as a near-model for how to integrate text and context through poetic reframing."
