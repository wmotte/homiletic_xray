    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "While the sermon contains beautiful imagery and historical insight, it ultimately functions as a guilt-inducing mechanism. It utilizes the 'Nurturing Parent' to soften the listener before the 'Critical Parent' delivers a blow regarding financial giving and personal ingratitude. The psychological impact is one of 'indebtedness' rather than 'inspiration.'",

      "The use of rhetorical questions to shame the audience ('Where are the nine?') reinforces a dysfunctional Parent-Child dynamic."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to maintain an Adult-Adult stance when discussing gratitude. Instead of accusing the congregation of being the 'nine,' invite them to explore the 'Free Child' joy of the one who returned. Move from 'You should be grateful' to 'What does it feel like to be whole?'"
