    "psychological_health_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically supportive and avoids the common homiletical trap of the 'Critical Parent.' By rejecting the idea of suffering as direct divine punishment, the preacher protects the listener from the 'Adapted Child' position of guilt. However, the heavy reliance on the 'Nurturing Parent' ego state creates a Rescuer/Victim dynamic that may foster spiritual dependency rather than Adult autonomy. The use of 'Ain't It Awful' regarding modern culture is the only significant 'game' present, used to create a bond of shared grievance between the pulpit and the pew.",
    "strengths": [
      "Refusal to use shame or judgment as a motivational tool.",
      "High degree of empathy and emotional intelligence in narrative.",
      "Strong Adult-level critique of 'poll-driven' leadership."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on the Rescuer role in the Drama Triangle.",
      "The opening anecdote is emotionally 'heavy' (Con) which may overwhelm the listener's Adult ego."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward a more 'Adult-Adult' transaction, the preacher could invite the congregation to reflect on how they can practically exercise agency in their 'nights of sorrow' rather than only 'waiting' for deliverance."
