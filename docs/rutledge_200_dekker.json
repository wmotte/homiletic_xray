  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon treats two distinct texts (2 Cor 13 and Psalm 130) as separate mini-sermons rather than a unified exposition. While it identifies the 'fullness' of the Trinitarian blessing in 2 Cor 13 as unique, it often lapses into generalities about 'love' and 'sin' that could be derived from many other passages.",
      "quotes": [
        "The one that we read today is the longest, richest, and fullest of all his valedictory blessings.",
        "The depth of which the psalmist is actually speaking here is the depth of the knowledge that he and everyone else is a 'miserable offender.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus on why the Trinitarian structure specifically is the answer to the Corinthian 'chaos' mentioned, rather than using it as a springboard for general reflections on parental love."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The preacher correctly identifies the historical tension in Corinth and the liturgical history of the Psalm (De Profundis). However, the 'Hebrew and Greek' depth demanded by Dekker is largely absent, replaced by liturgical history (Book of Common Prayer).",
      "quotes": [
        "The Corinthian church has gone completely off the rails and, furthermore, is on the verge of rejecting him as their leader.",
        "It is called De Profundis, 'out of the depths.' It begins at rock bottom."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the linguistic analysis of 'grace', 'love', and 'fellowship' to show how these specific Greek concepts addressed the specific Corinthian 'malady'."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application relies heavily on psychological analogies (the desperate parent, the drug-addicted child). While concrete, these are 'general truths' of human experience rather than the specific application of the Word to the zeitgeist. It lacks the political or societal edge Dekker suggests.",
      "quotes": [
        "Imagine for a moment that you are the parent of a child... hooked on drugs.",
        "Human love is a glimmer of the full radiance of God’s love."

      "improvement_point": "Move beyond family analogies to how the Trinitarian 'interrelatedness' critiques modern individualism or specific contemporary 'depths'."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a pattern of 'Illustration -> Text -> Meaning'. While not a strict 15/5 split, the movement is often from human experience toward the text, rather than the text 'expounding' the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "Reflect on your own life. Think about those people who have borne with you.",
        "That person has conveyed to you a measure of the love of God."

      "improvement_point": "Start with the text's own categories to interpret the human situation, rather than using human situations to make the text 'relatable'."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is a strong point. The preacher explicitly tackles 'misery' (miserable offenders) and 'redemption' (forgiveness/grace). The 'no health in us' section aligns well with Dekker’s insistence on not softening misery.",
      "quotes": [
        "The depth... is the depth of the knowledge that he and everyone else is a 'miserable offender.'",
        "The less we deserve, the more merit is in his bounty."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Strengthen the 'gratitude' (Sanctification) aspect; the sermon ends on redemption but lacks the 'new life' in concrete action."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on the 'verge of self-destruction' and being 'lost'. It takes the 'miserable offender' status seriously, which implies the 'two ways', though the 'eternal loss' is somewhat muted by a focus on God's 'inexhaustible' pursuit.",
      "quotes": [
        "The God who pursues us even beyond the grave with his resurrection power.",
        "The path of life... recognizing that sin is... estrangement from God."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is present as the source of grace and the one who 'became incarnate'. However, the sermon leans heavily on a general 'Trinitarian love' that sometimes risks becoming a 'vague Something' despite the preacher's warnings.",
      "quotes": [
        "God’s love spends itself to the very last drop of the blood of the Son.",
        "This is the love that has become incarnate in history through Jesus Christ."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1450 words, the sermon would take about 14-15 minutes. This falls short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum for 'breadth'. The treatment of two separate texts further fragments the depth.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Focus on one pericope and expand the 'exposition' to reach the 20-minute threshold required for substantive depth."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon fails Dekker's formal criteria primarily due to its insufficient length and the fragmentation caused by addressing two distinct liturgical dates/texts. While it recovers the 'misery' of the human condition effectively, it relies too heavily on general psychological analogies (parental love) rather than the 'specific' word of the text that can be found nowhere else.",
    "strengths": [
      "Rigorous recovery of the concept of 'misery' and 'sin' against modern liturgical softening.",
      "Clear identification of the Trinitarian formula as a response to congregational chaos."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (under 20 minutes) prevents the 'breadth' required for depth.",
      "Over-reliance on general human experience (psychology) to illustrate God's love.",
      "Lack of a single, specific Bible passage as the sole anchor."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a substantive religious address, but according to Dekker’s strict theses, it is not yet a 'sermon' because it lacks the necessary length for depth and fails the 'one specific passage' rule. It is a bicycle wheel improperly mounted."
