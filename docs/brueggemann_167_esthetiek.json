    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon relies heavily on conceptual and philosophical language rather than sensory imagery. While it references the 'stench' of the biblical world implicitly, it remains largely in the realm of 'telling' rather than 'showing.' The imagery that does appear—such as the 'liquidation sale' or 'free fall'—is effective but used more as a rhetorical device to explain a concept than to paint a vivid scene. The preacher does not 'paint' the encounter between Jesus and the rich man; he analyzes it. However, the use of 'free fall' as a metaphor for the religious stage provides a strong, visceral image of vulnerability that rescues the sermon from being purely academic.",
      "quotes": [
        "willingly goes into free fall in trust of God’s faithfulness.",
        "give the proceeds of your liquidation sale to the poor.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and demonstrates high 'stewardship of language.' The preacher avoids 'Canaanite' jargon, instead using clear, contemporary English to translate ancient concepts. The distinction between 'aesthetic,' 'ethical,' and 'religious' is handled with intellectual rigor. Every word feels intentional, particularly the use of 'penultimate' to describe human moral effort. The preacher does not hide behind vague religious platitudes but names specific social realities like 'privilege' and 'social security systems.' This precision creates a sense of intellectual honesty and respect for the hearer's intelligence.",
      "quotes": [
        "The man had managed to preserve privilege, had kept control of his life, and had not risked anything.",
        "God is not a player in his moral calculus of being on the right side of the big questions.",

        "The transition between the three biblical characters could be more linguistically fluid."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "The sermon uses philosophical jargon (Kierkegaard) but explains it clearly. Religious jargon is absent; theological concepts are 're-clothed' in contemporary language."

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a distinct rhetorical rhythm, characterized by the use of lists and parallelisms, particularly when reciting the commandments and Job's virtues. There is a 'staccato' quality to the three-part call to the rich man (Sell, Give, Follow) that creates urgency. The repetition of 'I have not...' in the Job section creates a liturgical cadence. While the language is somewhat academic, the sentence structure is varied enough to prevent monotony. The 'long awkward pause' mentioned in the text suggests an awareness of the oral/performative timing of the sermon.",
      "quotes": [
        "First, sell what you have; get rid of your stuff. Second, give the proceeds... Third, come, follow me.",
        "If I go forward, he is not there; or backward, I cannot perceive him; on the left he hides... I turn to the right, but I cannot see him.",
        "It may be! Perhaps! Not a sure thing."

        "Strong use of parallelism in the Job and Amos sections.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "Some sentences are overly long and contain multiple clauses that might be difficult to follow aurally.",

        "Increase the use of alliteration or assonance to make key phrases more memorable."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Balanced. It has the precision of a written essay but the rhythmic markers of an oral performance."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by intellectual precision and a sober, 'Reformed' beauty. It eschews sentimentalism for a sharp, analytical vocabulary that 'reframes' biblical texts through a Kierkegaardian lens. While it lacks sensory 'showing,' it excels in 'stewardship of language,' using every word to dismantle the hearer's moral self-satisfaction. The rhythm is steady and authoritative, though at times it leans toward the academic. It is the language of a 'witness' who is more interested in truth than in decoration."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' that moves from the comfort of the 'ethical' stage to the 'upsetting' of the 'religious' stage. The 'upsetting of equilibrium' occurs when the preacher challenges the 'good liberal' identity of the congregation. The movement through the three biblical examples (Rich Man, Job, Amos) creates a cumulative effect, building tension around the 'freedom of God.' The conclusion provides a resolution not by offering a 'happy ending,' but by pointing to the 'possibility of God' in the face of human impossibility. It is a dynamic journey from self-control to 'free fall.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The guy breathed a sigh of relief, for he found Jesus’ word to him very reassuring... End of story! (But it wasn't).",
        "There was, I imagine, a long awkward pause in the conversation.",
        "The world of God does not work so that our good ethical effort guarantees good God-outcomes."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The 'awkward pause' in the narrative creates a palpable turning point.",
        "The structure effectively subverts the listener's expectations of a 'well done' for being ethical.",
        "The cumulative use of three texts builds a strong thematic arc."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition from the 'aesthetic' to the 'ethical' stage is very brief and could be more dramaturgically integrated.",
        "The ending feels slightly abrupt; the 'possibility of God' could be more fully developed as the 'climax.'",
        "The introduction of Kierkegaard is a bit 'dry' for a narrative opening."

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. It performs a masterclass in 'reframing.' The preacher takes the ancient texts and places them within the contemporary frame of 'consumer culture,' 'good liberals,' and 'social security systems.' The integration is organic; the biblical characters are not just historical figures but 'case studies' for the modern hearer. The 'strangeness' of God's freedom in Job and Amos is preserved, preventing the text from being 'smoothed over' for easy consumption. It forces the hearer to see their own 'ethical' life as 'penultimate' in the light of the 'ultimate' mystery of God.",
      "quotes": [
        "He sounds to me like a good liberal that most of us aspire to be.",
        "Jesus introduced in the horizon of the man a new social reality, the poor.",
        "We now live in a world that eludes even our best moral calculus."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of the rich young ruler as a man seeking 'abiding significance' rather than just 'heaven.'",
        "The connection between Amos's 'perhaps' and our modern lack of control is profound.",
        "Honors the 'otherness' of God in the Job text."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could more explicitly name the 'political economic establishment' to sharpen the contextual edge.",
        "The 'aesthetic' stage could be more clearly linked to specific 21st-century consumer behaviors.",
        "The synthesis between the three texts could be even tighter in the conclusion."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing. It shifts the frame from 'being good' to 'trusting the mystery,' fundamentally changing how the hearer perceives their moral life."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is a quintessential 'open work of art.' By concluding with the 'perhaps' of Amos and the 'impossibility' of Mark, it refuses to offer a 'sealed' moralistic solution. It acknowledges the ambivalence of existence and the 'hiddenness' of God. The hearer is not given a new set of rules but is invited into a 'free fall.' The ending is an invitation to wonder rather than a prescriptive 'to-do' list. It respects the hearer as a mature partner who must navigate the 'slippage' between their efforts and God's grace.",
      "quotes": [
        "It may be! Perhaps! Not a sure thing.",
        "Job is reduced to wonder and awe before the God who overrides his moral claims.",
        "For mortals it is impossible, but not for God."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The emphasis on 'perhaps' creates immense space for the hearer's own interpretation.",
        "The sermon avoids the 'happy ending' kitsch by leaving the rich man in his sadness.",
        "Acknowledges the 'restlessness' that remains even in a virtuous life."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The Kierkegaardian framework is quite rigid and could potentially 'close' the interpretation for some.",
        "The 'third stage' could be described with even more 'open' imagery to avoid it becoming a new 'requirement.'",
        "Ensure the 'impossibility' at the end doesn't lead to passivity."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Highly polyvalent. It sustains the tension between human effort and divine freedom without a cheap resolution."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.66,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is sophisticated, moving from the 'equilibrium' of the ethical life to the 'upsetting' reality of God's radical freedom. It avoids the static nature of traditional three-point sermons by weaving three distinct biblical voices into a single narrative movement toward the 'mystery of God.' The integration of text and context is seamless, providing a 'reframing' that is both intellectually stimulating and spiritually challenging. Most importantly, it remains an 'open work,' leaving the hearer in the 'space for grace' created by the word 'perhaps.'"
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It explicitly rejects the 'happy ending' and 'pre-chewed emotions' often found in contemporary preaching. Instead of offering immediate comfort, it sustains the 'pain of the awkward pause' and the 'frustration of Job.' There is no sentimentality here; the preacher does not try to make the listener 'feel good' about their virtue. By highlighting the 'perhaps' of Amos, the sermon destroys the 'kitsch' of a predictable, transactional relationship with God. It is an authentic encounter with the 'Holy' as something unavailable and mysterious.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None present. The sermon actively deconstructs the kitsch of 'being good while being well-off.'",
      "Avoids the cliché of 'Jesus is the answer' by showing Jesus as the one who asks the hardest questions."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of Job's frustration when God 'will not answer his summons.'",
      "The admission that 'our best intentions do not control God.'"
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of 'sober beauty' by continuing to resist the urge to provide easy answers to the 'restlessness' of the congregation."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon creates significant 'space for grace' by dismantling the 'moral calculus' that often blocks it. By moving the hearer from the 'ethical' (where we are in control) to the 'religious' (where God is in control), it opens a space for the 'unavailable' action of God. Cilliers' concept of 'reframing' is evident: reality is no longer seen as a series of tasks to be completed for 'abiding significance,' but as a 'free fall' into mystery. The sermon sustains the tension between 'already' (doing justice) and 'not yet' (the 'perhaps' of God's grace).",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between human 'moral passion' and divine 'hiddenness' is maintained until the very last sentence.",
    "mystery_respected": "Highly respected. God is described as 'elusive,' 'hidden,' and 'beyond us.'",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails, but only after the limits of 'moralization' (the ethical stage) have been thoroughly exposed.",
    "recommendation": "To create even more space, the preacher could explore the 'joy' or 'peace' that might exist within the 'free fall,' to show that grace is not just a 'perhaps' but a 'presence.'"
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'Reframing Homiletics.' It successfully navigates the 'aesthetic turn' by prioritizing the form of the 'open work' over the closed system of dogmatic truths. The poetics of the language are sober and precise, reflecting a 'stewardship of words' that respects both the biblical text and the modern hearer's intellect. The dramaturgy is particularly effective, using a philosophical framework to create a narrative arc that leads the listener from the security of their own 'ethical' achievements into the 'free fall' of faith. It avoids the pitfall of religious kitsch by refusing to offer easy comfort or moralistic shortcuts, instead dwelling in the 'awkward pauses' and 'elusive' nature of the Divine. While it leans toward the academic/conceptual (Domain A), its structural integrity and 'space for grace' (Domain B) are exemplary.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Intellectual precision and stewardship of language that avoids religious clichés.",
      "Masterful 'reframing' of biblical texts into the contemporary 'ethical' context.",
      "Resolute avoidance of kitsch, sustaining the mystery and freedom of God."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase sensory imagery ('showing') to balance the conceptual 'telling.'",
      "Soften the academic introduction to make the 'aesthetic' entry point more inviting.",
      "Develop the 'musicality' of the conclusion to match the rhythmic strength of the middle sections."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Analytical / Reframing",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Thomas G. Long (Form follows text/Witness).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'second-stage' adults—intellectually engaged, socially conscious 'good liberals' who are restless with conventional piety.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more narrative-driven opening that starts with a sensory image rather than a philosopher.",
      "Use the 'Four Pages' method to ensure a more even balance between 'trouble' and 'grace' imagery.",
      "Read the text aloud during drafting to identify and break up overly complex 'paper-language' sentences."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a model of 'sober beauty.' It does not seek to dazzle with baroque metaphors but with the 'sharpness of the Word' that cuts through moral self-satisfaction. It is aesthetically successful because it creates a 'space for grace' that feels authentic to the human condition of 'restlessness.' By honoring the 'perhaps' of God, it invites the hearer into a genuine 'event' of encounter with the Holy, rather than a mere educational session. It is a high-quality homiletical work that respects the 'openness' of the gospel."
