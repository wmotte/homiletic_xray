    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in sensory imagery, moving from the abstract 'joy' to concrete, almost tactile examples. Augustine uses the 'milk of hope' versus the 'robust food of reality' to illustrate the eschatological tension. He masterfully employs everyday objects—gold, silver, lead, dust, and even the 'bait dangling from the line'—to ground theological concepts. The imagery of the 'eyes of the heart' versus 'eyes of the flesh' provides a visual framework for the entire ethical argument. The vivid depiction of the merchant's partners ousting him for valuing lead over gold creates a mental 'scene' that functions as a cinematic parable. This is 'showing' rather than 'telling' at its best, as the hearer can almost feel the weight of the metals and the shame of the social exclusion described.",

        "No longer the milk of hope, but the robust food of reality.",
        "You pursue the bait dangling from the line and, without realizing it, you swallow the sin.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strongly 'showing'. Augustine constructs scenarios (the merchant, the slave, the crying child) to demonstrate his points rather than merely stating dogmatic truths."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise, particularly in its philosophical distinctions between 'use' (uti) and 'enjoyment' (frui), though these technical terms are translated into accessible merchant-class vocabulary. Augustine avoids 'Canaanite' jargon by defining his terms through dialogue: 'What is God? What’s he like? ... God is love.' He is careful to distinguish between the goodness of creation and the perversity of the human will, preventing a Manichaean dualism. The stewardship of language is evident in the way he handles the word 'faithfulness,' distinguishing between the 'supernatural' and the 'everyday' loyalty demanded of a slave. However, the rhetorical repetition, while effective for orality, occasionally borders on the redundant for a written text.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s not that you love sin, but that, loving something disorderedly, you fall into sin.",
        "God is above you, and you’re glad he created you; but you also wish he hadn’t made anything else that was good.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a rhythmic, almost percussive quality, typical of the North African rhetorical style. There is a clear use of parallelism ('The Lord has given... The Lord has taken away') and antithesis ('eyes wide open... eyes shut tight'). The sentence structure varies effectively between short, punchy imperatives ('Come back!', 'Don't block your ears!') and longer, flowing periods that build toward a climax. The use of alliteration and assonance (though more apparent in the original Latin) carries over into the rhythmic structure of the translation. It is clearly 'oral language' designed to be heard, with a cadence that mirrors the heartbeat of a passionate speaker.",

        "The conclusion, while thematic, lacks the rhythmic 'punch' of the earlier sections."

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The micro-aesthetics of the sermon are exceptionally strong. Augustine uses vivid, everyday imagery (merchants, slaves, crying children) to ground high-level theological concepts. His language is precise yet accessible, avoiding heavy jargon in favor of relational and commercial metaphors that his audience would immediately grasp. The rhythm is percussive and engaging, utilizing antithesis and parallelism to make the 'Word' feel like a 'Happening'. It is a prime example of 'showing' the Gospel through the 'eyes of the heart'."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' as described by Lowry. It begins with an 'upsetting of equilibrium': we are told to rejoice in a God we cannot see. This creates a tension that Augustine sustains throughout. He then moves through a series of 'scenes'—the merchant's office, the church during a slave's manumission, the home of a crying child—each increasing the tension between human desire and divine grace. The turning point (the 'climax') occurs in §7, where the preacher reveals that God's 'blood' is not money, but his actual life. The resolution in §10 offers a 'reframing' of wealth, not as an evil to be discarded, but as a tool to be 'beautified' by right use.",
      "quotes": [
        "How can we rejoice in something we don’t see?",
        "God, however, cries out against you, and uses your servant to convict you.",
        "If you’ve felt some stirring in your soul... come back!"

        "Strong opening that establishes a theological problem (seeing vs. believing).",
        "The 'climax' in the comparison between the slave-owner's 'blood' (money) and Christ's blood is dramatically powerful.",
        "The movement from 'reproach' to 'invitation' is handled with pastoral sensitivity."

        "The transition between §3 and §4 is a bit of a leap from abstract 'goodness' to 'merchants'.",
        "The section on Job (§9) feels slightly tacked on as a secondary climax rather than an integrated part of the main arc.",
        "The ending could be more 'open'—it becomes somewhat moralistic in its final instructions."

      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey. It feels like a courtroom drama where the hearer is the defendant, eventually led to a place of grace."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a masterclass in 'reframing' (Cilliers). Augustine takes the biblical command to 'rejoice' and reframes it within the socio-economic reality of late-antique Hippo. He bridges the 'then' of the Psalms and the 'now' of the slave-market and the merchant-guild. The integration is organic; he doesn't just quote Scripture, he lets the Scripture 'speak' through the characters of his parables. He respects the 'strangeness' of the invisible God while making that God palpably present in the 'faithfulness' one expects from a slave. He successfully reframes 'unanswered prayer' not as divine absence, but as parental protection (the child and the horse).",
      "quotes": [
        "You demand that your servant be true to you because you bought him... Recall what I gave for you.",
        "You’re planning to leave him your entire fortune... yet you won’t allow this pathetic little child to ride your horse.",
        "Instead of adorning yourself with [gold], you should adorn it."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant use of the slave/master relationship to explain the Creator/creature relationship.",
        "The 'reframing' of gold from a 'distraction' to an 'opportunity for beauty' is highly effective.",
        "The connection between the 'blood' of the covenant and the 'blood' of the wallet is a sharp contextual hook."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The application to 'fornicators and debauchees' at the end feels a bit like a generic 'list' compared to the specific merchant metaphors.",
        "The 'mountain' metaphor in §2 could be more clearly linked to the specific geography of the hearers.",
        "The integration of the 'Job' story is less 'contextualized' than the merchant stories."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes. It reframes the invisible God as the 'Fidelity' we already value in our visible relationships."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is rhetorically 'open' in its use of dialogue and invitation, it leans toward a 'closed' structure in its moral application. Augustine uses the 'Opera Aperta' (Stark) concept by inviting the hearer to 'examine your attitude,' but he quickly provides the 'correct' answers. The 'crying child' analogy is a closed system—it explains away the mystery of suffering with a neat parental logic. However, the ending (§10) leaves a small space for the hearer to decide how they will 'beautify' their own gold, which provides a degree of polyvalence. The tension between the 'already' and 'not yet' of seeing God remains an open theological horizon.",
      "quotes": [
        "Why keep asking yourself, 'What is God? What’s he like?' Whatever notion you may concoct, he’s not that.",
        "Leave everything in God’s hands: he knows what to give you, and what to take away.",
        "See to it, though, that you act accordingly if and when you actually do have it."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the 'ineffable' nature of God, leaving room for mystery.",
        "The use of 'if' in the conclusion allows the hearer to envision their own response.",
        "The 'not yet' of the vision of God keeps the eschatological horizon open."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'child and horse' analogy is perhaps too 'neat' for those experiencing profound suffering.",
        "The sermon ends with a fairly prescriptive set of instructions on how to use money.",
        "The dialogue often feels like a 'trap' where the preacher always wins, rather than a true open-ended inquiry."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly monovalent. It is a 'teaching' sermon that uses 'open' rhetorical techniques to lead to a 'closed' ethical conclusion."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are characterized by a strong, dramatic arc. Augustine moves from the theological problem of an invisible God to a series of contextual 'courtroom' scenes that force the hearer into a corner of self-reflection. The integration of text and context is superior, particularly in the 'reframing' of commercial ethics into divine worship. While the structure is somewhat 'closed' by its moralistic conclusion, the journey is dynamic and maintains a high level of engagement through the use of character and dialogue."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. Augustine avoids 'cheap comfort' by leaning into the 'thorn in the flesh' and the 'rod of the Father.' He does not offer a 'happy ending' to the merchant's greed or the child's tears; instead, he demands a 'robust food of reality.' The emotions are authentic—shame, desire, frustration—and are not 'pre-chewed.' He explicitly warns against the 'bait' of easy pleasures. The use of the 'slave' and 'blood' imagery is gritty and realistic for his time, not sentimentalized. He sustains the tension of 'not seeing' God rather than providing a kitschy 'spiritual experience.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None present. Even the 'child' analogy, which could be kitsch, is used to explain 'want' and 'punishment' rather than 'sweetness'.",
      "The potential for kitsch in 'God is love' is avoided by immediately defining love as a 'force' and a 'spell' of goodness."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The moment where the slave-owner is confronted with the fact that he calls his money his 'blood'.",
      "The acknowledgment that a woman might be 'detested' after marriage because she didn't live up to expectations—a brutally honest observation of human fickleness."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of 'sober beauty' by continuing to contrast 'milk' with 'robust food'."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened through the 'reframing' of God's absence as a 'foretaste' and a 'hope.' By emphasizing that God 'stoops' to the humble, Augustine creates a 'space' where the hearer's own failures (the 'broken heart') become the site of God's presence. However, the space is slightly constricted by the heavy emphasis on 'fidelity' as a 'requirement' (the slave analogy). While grace is the 'ineffable good,' the sermon's later sections focus heavily on the 'proper use' of things, which can feel like a return to the 'law.' Yet, the central image of Christ's blood as the 'ransom' ensures that grace remains the foundation of the space.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'already' and 'not yet' is sustained throughout the first half.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of God's nature is respected ('Whatever notion you may concoct, he’s not that').",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the 'redemption' section, but moralization takes over in the final 'gold' section.",
    "recommendation": "To create more space, allow the 'ineffable' nature of God to linger longer in the concluding ethical section, rather than resolving it into a list of 'good deeds'."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the 'Reframing' style. Augustine successfully takes the abstract theological concept of 'rejoicing in the Lord' and translates it into the sensory, high-stakes world of late-antique commerce and domestic life. The poetics of the language are characterized by sharp antitheses and vivid 'showing' through parables. The dramaturgy is effective, utilizing a 'diatribe' style that engages the hearer in a simulated dialogue, leading them from the 'fleshly' love of gold to the 'spiritual' love of the Giver. While the sermon leans toward a moralistic 'closedness' in its final application, it avoids kitsch entirely by grounding its comfort in the 'robust food' of Christ's sacrifice and the reality of human suffering. It creates a 'Space for Grace' by identifying God's presence in the 'humble' and 'broken-hearted' rather than the 'high mountains' of human achievement.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful use of contextual 'reframing' (the merchant and slave analogies).",
      "Total absence of religious kitsch; maintains a 'sober beauty'.",
      "Strong rhythmic and percussive oral quality that creates a sense of 'event'."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The transition to the 'Job' section could be more structurally integrated.",
      "The final moral application could be more 'open' to allow for diverse hearer responses.",
      "The 'child and horse' analogy could be nuanced to avoid sounding dismissive of genuine pain."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Dramatic (Diatribe)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Show don't tell).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to those who appreciate intellectual rigor combined with concrete, everyday examples—specifically those struggling with the tension between material wealth and spiritual life.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer in the 'mystery' of the vision of God.",
      "Use more sensory language for the 'ineffable' goodness to make the 'foretaste' even more palpable.",
      "Integrate biblical examples (like Job) as characters within the contemporary parables rather than as separate appendices."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A high-quality aesthetic performance that demonstrates how 'form is content.' By using the language of the marketplace to discuss the 'pearl' of the conscience, Augustine does not just talk about God; he makes the 'Holy happen' in the very midst of the hearer's economic and social reality. The sermon is a model of how to avoid the 'kitsch' of easy piety by demanding a 'robust' engagement with the Giver rather than the gifts."
