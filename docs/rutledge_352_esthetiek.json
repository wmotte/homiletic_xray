    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in sensory imagery, particularly regarding the 'unspiritual' and 'pungent' reality of death. By leaning into the 'stink' of the tomb and the 'icy feel' of a corpse, the preacher avoids the 'religious kitsch' Johan Cilliers warns against. The imagery is not merely decorative; it serves a theological purpose: to establish the 'Great Antagonist' as a formidable reality. The use of the Emily Dickinson poem and the description of the undertakers as 'businesslike' creates a visceral, cinematic experience for the hearer. This is a prime example of Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' principle, where the horror of the grave is painted so vividly that the subsequent light of the resurrection is not a cliché but a rescue.",
      "quotes": [
        "The King James Version, in its robust Jacobean style, puts it more pungently: 'He stinketh.'",
        "They spread out a rubber sheet on the floor, hoisted the body off the sofa and down onto it, wrapped it up and carried it off as if it were nothing more than a sack of garden mulch.",

        "The imagery of the 'sack of garden mulch' is powerful but could be balanced with more concrete images of the 'new life' to avoid a purely negative aesthetic.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise and demonstrates what Marilyn Chandler McEntyre calls 'stewardship of language.' The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by defining theological concepts through experience and literature. There is a deliberate choice of words—'pungently,' 'squeamish,' 'predilection'—that suggests a high level of literacy and respect for the congregation's intelligence. The precision is most evident in the distinction between 'immortality' (a human illusion) and 'resurrection' (a divine act). However, the end of the sermon relies heavily on a string of biblical titles which, while traditional, slightly reduces the linguistic precision established earlier in favor of liturgical weight.",

        "Our culture is infamous for its unceasing attempts to manage death, to get it out of sight, to perfume it and embalm it.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a rhythmic cadence that suggests it was written for the ear. The preacher uses variation in sentence length effectively—short, punchy sentences for the reality of death ('He stinketh.') and longer, more flowing periods for the theological reflections. There is a liturgical 'flow' that reflects the Anglican tradition mentioned in the text. The use of parallelism ('Death has a horrible color... Death has a terrible icy feel') creates a repetitive, almost haunting rhythm that mirrors the persistence of the 'last enemy.' The conclusion builds to a rhetorical crescendo that utilizes the musicality of the King James Bible and the Prayer Book.",
      "quotes": [
        "Death has a horrible color; I have seen it many times since. Death has a terrible icy feel, too.",
        "Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage.",

        "Some paragraphs are quite long and might require careful breath control in performance."

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The micro-aesthetics of the sermon are exceptionally strong. The preacher uses a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that values the 'beauty of simplicity' and the power of the concrete. By refusing to 'perfume' the language of the grave, the preacher creates a linguistic space where the gospel can sound as a radical interruption rather than a pleasant addition. The stewardship of language is evident in the careful selection of literary quotes and the avoidance of religious clichés. The result is a text that feels both ancient and urgently modern, honoring the 'robust' style of the past while addressing contemporary 'tender-mindedness.'"

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a classic 'Lowry Loop' or 'Homiletical Plot.' It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with the smell of death, moves into a deep exploration of the 'problem' (the sovereignty of death), and reaches a clear turning point ('But in the end it is no contest'). The movement is not just logical but emotional—from the living room sofa to the cosmic duel at the tomb. The preacher sustains the tension by refusing to offer a 'cheap' solution early on. The question 'Did Lazarus have a choice?' serves as a brilliant dramaturgical pivot, shifting the focus from the power of death to the irresistible power of the Creator's voice.",
      "quotes": [
        "The reason I am talking about death in such stark terms is that the Bible talks about it.",
        "This is a truly cosmic duel. But in the end it is no contest.",
        "When Jesus Christ the Son of God steps forward to the door of Lazarus' tomb and speaks, it is the same voice that was heard at Creation."

      "strengths": [
        "The 'upsetting' opening is immediate and compelling.",
        "The delay of the 'grace' page allows the 'trouble' to be fully felt, making the resolution more powerful.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a masterclass in Johan Cilliers' 'reframing.' The preacher takes the ancient text of John 11 and reframes the modern hearer's experience of 'memorial services' and 'morticians' in light of it. The context—a culture that 'perfumes' death—is confronted by the 'blunt' biblical reality. The synthesis is organic: the personal story of the priest's first encounter with death bridges the gap between the 1st-century tomb and the 21st-century living room. The 'reframing' occurs when death is no longer seen as a 'natural transition' but as the 'Great Antagonist' that only God can conquer. This respects the 'strangeness' of the text while making it devastatingly relevant.",
      "quotes": [
        "Death was a visible, smellable fact of life... until about a hundred years ago when we started calling in the morticians.",
        "Memorial services tend to be more Corinthian and less Biblical, because they celebrate the person's life independently of the power of Death.",
        "In the midst of life we are in death... There we remain unless there is an intervention from beyond this world order."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Sharp critique of contemporary 'psychologizing' of death.",
        "Surprising connection between the Lazarus story and the doctrine of Creation.",
        "The use of the 'Corinthian' label for modern attitudes is a clever homiletical move."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'American Way of Death' reference might feel dated to some younger hearers.",
        "More could be said about how the 'Undoing of Death' looks in the specific 'context' of the congregation's daily life beyond the cemetery.",
        "The integration of the Stringfellow quote is dense and might require more 'translation' for the context."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes; reality is reframed from 'managed death' to 'cosmic battleground' to 'new creation.'"
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is aesthetically rich, it leans toward a 'closed' structure in its theological certainty. Following Ciska Stark's 'open work of art,' one might ask if there is room for the hearer's doubt. The preacher acknowledges the 'obscene mystery' of death, which provides some openness, but the resolution is presented as an 'irresistible' command. The question 'Did Lazarus have a choice?' is used rhetorically to prove a point rather than to invite open-ended reflection. However, the final question—'Believest thou this?'—is a classic 'open' ending that places the responsibility of appropriation squarely on the hearer, preventing the sermon from being a purely closed system of dogmatics.",
      "quotes": [
        "When Jesus said, 'Lazarus, come forth,' did Lazarus have a choice?",
        "Could the light have said 'No'?",
        "'Believest thou this?'"

      "strengths": [
        "The final question prevents the sermon from being a lecture and makes it an encounter.",
        "The acknowledgement of the 'mysterious' nature of the story (why only in John?) shows intellectual honesty.",
        "The space given to the 'lament' of death allows the hearer to bring their own grief into the sermon."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'no contest' conclusion could feel dismissive to someone currently in the 'no man's land' of grief.",
        "The rhetorical questions are largely 'leading questions' with one 'correct' answer.",
        "More room could be made for the 'not yet'—the fact that we still die despite Lazarus's raising."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent but with a powerful 'open' liturgical invitation at the end."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are characterized by a strong, purposeful movement. The sermon does not meander; it marches toward the tomb. The dramaturgy is built on the tension between the 'sovereignty of death' and the 'sovereignty of God.' By refusing to resolve this tension too quickly, the preacher honors the human experience of loss. The integration of text and context is seamless, using the Lazarus narrative to 'reframe' modern funeral practices. While the structure is quite 'closed' in its theological conviction, the final liturgical question opens a space for the hearer to respond to the 'event' of the proclamation."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is a powerful antidote to religious kitsch. It explicitly attacks the 'perfumed' and 'embalmed' sentimentality of modern death rituals. By insisting on the 'stink' and the 'icy feel' of the corpse, the preacher avoids the 'happy ending' cliché that Johan Cilliers identifies as the hallmark of kitsch. The emotion is authentic because it is grounded in the 'obscene mystery' and the 'rotten deal' of mortality. There is no 'cheap comfort' here; the comfort only comes after the 'last enemy' has been given its due. The use of Stringfellow and Dickinson further anchors the sermon in a gritty, honest aesthetic that respects the gravity of the subject matter.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'Corinthian' preference for thinking of death as a 'mere blip on the screen of immortality' (identified as kitsch by the preacher).",
      "The 'perfuming' and 'embalming' of death to make it more palatable."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the undertakers handling the body like a 'sack of garden mulch.'",
      "The admission of the 'shock' and 'alien' feeling of the first death the priest witnessed."

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon creates a 'Space for Grace' precisely by first creating a 'Space for Death.' In Cilliers' terms, grace is only 'grace' if it is an interruption of the 'already' (death). By sustaining the tension of the 'four days dead' and the 'strict arrest' of the sergeant Death, the preacher makes the 'Lazarus, come forth!' a true event of grace. The mystery of God is respected—not as a puzzle to be solved, but as a Power that 'calls into existence the things that do not exist.' The sermon moves from the 'moralization' of trying to control death through psychology to the 'grace' of a God who 'hates Death' and acts on our behalf.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'icy feel' of death and the 'warm human contact' of life is sustained until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, the preacher explicitly calls death an 'obscene mystery' and the raising of Lazarus 'mysterious.'",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the focus is entirely on God's 'invasion' and 'plundering' of death's kingdom, not on human effort.",
    "recommendation": "To further open space, the preacher could acknowledge the 'silence' of God that many feel during the 'four days' before the stone is rolled away."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the 'Theology of the Cross' translated into homiletic form. It rejects the 'aestheticism' of beautiful but empty words in favor of a 'sober beauty' that looks directly into the grave. The poetics of language are characterized by sensory precision and a rhythmic, oral quality that honors the Anglican tradition. The dramaturgy is effectively structured as a 'cosmic duel,' leading the hearer from the visceral reality of a living room death to the ontological reality of the New Creation. Its greatest aesthetic achievement is its refusal of kitsch; it does not offer comfort until it has first acknowledged the 'stink' of the human condition. This creates a profound 'Space for Grace' where the resurrection is not a predictable doctrine but a shocking, life-giving event.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Radical anti-kitsch stance that honors the 'blunt' reality of death.",
      "Vivid sensory imagery that makes the biblical narrative 'smellable' and 'touchable.'",
      "Strong narrative arc that connects the raising of Lazarus to the original act of Creation."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The 'closed' nature of the rhetorical questions could be softened to allow more room for the hearer's struggle.",
      "The liturgical 'crescendo' at the end relies on a density of titles that may overwhelm the previous precision.",
      "The transition between the historical Anglican liturgy section and the Lazarus narrative could be more fluid."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Poetic-Imagistic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'mature' hearers (as the preacher notes) who are weary of superficial comfort and seek a faith that takes the 'obscene mystery' of suffering seriously.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'open' questions that allow the congregation to sit in the 'between' space of the 'already/not yet.'",
      "Continue using 'unspiritual' details to ground theological abstractions.",
      "Maintain the high level of literary stewardship (Dickinson/Shakespeare) as it provides a secular 'bridge' for the sacred message."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically superior work that demonstrates how 'how' something is said is inseparable from 'what' is said. By using a 'dark' aesthetic to describe death, the preacher makes the 'light' of the gospel shine with authentic brilliance. It is a model of 'reframing' that challenges the hearer's cultural frames and replaces them with a biblical optics. While it leans toward a high-authority proclamation (monovalent), its final question ensures it remains an 'event' of encounter rather than a mere lecture."
