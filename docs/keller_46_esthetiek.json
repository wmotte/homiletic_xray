    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes imagery effectively by grounding abstract theological concepts in concrete physical realities. The preacher follows Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don’t tell' by focusing on the 'fire' as a recurring sensory anchor. The imagery of the 'shriveled, bent fingers' of Joni Eareckson Tada provides a visceral contrast to the 'dazzling' resurrection body. However, some metaphors remain somewhat conventional ('life falling apart', 'plunged into a sea of grace'). The strength lies in the 'cinematic' reconstruction of the beach scene, where the smell of charcoal and fish serves as a bridge between Peter’s trauma and his restoration. The imagery is not merely decorative but serves as a 'reframing' tool to help the hearer visualize the tangible nature of resurrection.",
      "quotes": [
        "I, with shriveled, bent fingers, atrophied muscles, gnarled knees, and no feeling from the shoulders down...",
        "He makes Peter sit down at a fire. Do you remember the last time Peter was at a fire?",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably precise and exhibits high 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre). The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by explaining theological terms through human experience. For instance, 'homo incurvatus in se' is not just quoted but vividly translated as being 'curved in on oneself.' The distinction between 'sentiment' (The Princess Bride) and 'life-transforming power' is handled with intellectual rigor. Every word seems to serve the purpose of clarity, and the preacher nuances the 'shame and honor culture' to help a modern audience understand the gravity of Peter's failure. The precision in defining the Greek word 'poimainō' adds depth without becoming an academic lecture.",
      "quotes": [
        "You are man curved in on himself, radically self-centered.",
        "This is a shame and honor culture... a violation, a grievous thing, a shame that can never be remedied.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is clearly designed for oral delivery, featuring a conversational cadence. There is a rhythmic use of repetition ('The real you. The real you.') that builds rhetorical intensity. However, the structure is somewhat 'staccato' due to the analytical four-point framework, which occasionally interrupts the 'flow' or 'legato' of the narrative. The rhythm is more that of a teacher or a witness (Long) than a poet. While the sentences are clear and vary in length, they lack the high poetic musicality found in preachers like Barbara Brown Taylor. It is effective 'oral language' but leans more toward the didactic than the lyrical.",
      "quotes": [
        "The deepest part of your heart just says, 'Me, me, me, me! What’s good for me?'",
        "Tender and strong, humble and bold, but I want you to be the leader.",

        "The four-point structure creates a somewhat predictable, mechanical rhythm.",
        "Could use more alliteration or assonance to make key phrases more 'sticky'.",
        "The conclusion feels slightly abrupt, lacking a final rhythmic crescendo."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Distinctly oral language; the transcript captures a spontaneous, communicative style."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high level of micro-aesthetic quality through its precise 'stewardship of language' and vivid imagery. It successfully avoids religious kitsch by grounding the 'beauty' of grace in the 'ugliness' of failure and physical suffering. While the musicality is more didactic than poetic, the clarity and sensory detail (the fire, the atrophied muscles) create a compelling 'optics' for the hearer. The language is transparent toward the message, never drawing attention to itself as 'fine writing' but acting as a sharp instrument of 'reframing' reality."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'Lowry-esque' plot, beginning with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium'—the spectacular failure of Peter. The tension is maintained by contrasting Peter’s boast with his humiliating denial. The 'turning point' is identified not just at the resurrection, but specifically at the charcoal fire on the beach. The movement from 'failure' to 'grace' to 'mission' provides a clear trajectory. However, the insertion of a four-point propositional list in the middle ('You have to believe... understand... submit... live') slightly flattens the narrative arc, shifting the experience from a 'journey' to a 'lecture' before returning to the narrative power of the Dick Lucas story.",
      "quotes": [
        "I don’t know of any story of a more spectacular failure than this, do you?",
        "Actually, he’s letting Peter experience a death, the death of his allusions of self-sufficiency.",
        "Nothing makes you more effective... than your failure plunged into a sea of my grace."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong opening that establishes high stakes (the 'spectacular failure').",
        "Excellent use of the Dick Lucas anecdote as a secondary narrative arc to illustrate the final point.",
        "The 'fire' serves as a brilliant dramaturgical bridge between the 'trouble' and the 'grace'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The four-point list is a 'clunky' structural device that interrupts the narrative flow.",
        "The transition from the historical evidence (Bauckham) back to the existential application is a bit sudden.",
        "The 'upsetting' of the beginning could be even more dramatic by starting directly with the rooster's crow."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A hybrid of a 'Lowry loop' and a traditional 'three/four-point' structure; moves from conflict to resolution."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong point of the sermon. The preacher 'reframes' (Cilliers) the ancient text within contemporary categories: the 'shame and honor culture' vs. 'individualistic culture', and the 'Costco receipt' analogy for justification. The integration of Richard Bauckham’s historical-critical insights provides an intellectual 'frame' that respects the 'strangeness' of the text while making it plausible for a modern skeptic. The connection between Peter’s failure and the modern 'career reversal' or 'criticism' shows a deep understanding of the hearer’s context. The text is not a springboard; the sermon stays 'between the stories' (Van Dusseldorp).",
      "quotes": [
        "We live in a very relativistic and individualistic culture... This is not like that.",
        "The resurrection is like a receipt... If you go to a Costco... they won’t let you out unless they look at your receipt.",
        "If God is your number one love and you have a career reversal, it hurts, but if your career is number one... you’re devastated."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Sophisticated 'reframing' of biblical shame into modern psychological anxiety.",
        "Effective use of 'secular' analogies (Costco, The Princess Bride) to explain sacred truths.",
        "Honors the historical 'otherness' of the text while proving its contemporary relevance."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'Costco' analogy, while clear, might feel a bit 'low-brow' compared to the Bauckham/Augustine references.",
        "Could address the 'context' of modern doubt more directly in the section on 'reality'.",
        "The Sri Lankan quote (Ramachandra) is excellent but could be more deeply woven into the 'Galilee' context."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes; reality is reframed from 'achievement-based' to 'grace-based' through the lens of Peter's failure."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Aesthetically, the sermon leans toward 'closedness'. While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (suffering, cancer, failure), the four-point structure and the very specific 'receipt' analogy for the cross tend to 'seal' the interpretation. The preacher acts more as a 'teacher' than a 'witness' (Long), providing a complete system of answers. There is little room for the 'polyvalence' Stark advocates; the hearer is led to a very specific, singular conclusion about the mechanics of grace. The ending is a prayer that seeks to apply the points rather than an 'open invitation' to the mystery.",
      "quotes": [
        "Here are the four principles we’ll learn here.",
        "The resurrection is your proof that it was all paid for.",
        "We know how it can happen."

      "strengths": [
        "Provides great clarity and security for the hearer.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "Reduce the 'instructional' tone ('You have to...') to allow more 'appropriation' by the hearer.",
        "Leave some questions unanswered to respect the 'mystery' of the resurrection.",
        "The conclusion 'We know how it can happen' is very closed; an open-ended question might be more 'aesthetic'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Monovalent; the sermon functions as a 'closed system' of theological and psychological truth."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is characterized by a strong narrative arc that is occasionally hampered by a didactic four-point framework. The sermon excels in 'reframing' the biblical world for a contemporary audience, creating a bridge between ancient shame and modern anxiety. However, it lacks the 'openness' of an 'opera aperta', opting instead for a clear, closed, and highly structured 'map' of salvation. The dramaturgy is effective in moving the hearer from the 'trouble' of failure to the 'grace' of restoration, but the 'teacher' persona dominates the 'poet' or 'witness'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It explicitly rejects 'feel-good factors' (The Princess Bride) and 'symbolic hope' that doesn't account for 'gnarled knees' and 'atrophied muscles.' By dwelling on the 'horrendous, egregious betrayal' of Peter and the 'stench' of failure, it avoids the 'happy ending' cliché. The comfort offered is not 'cheap' because it is preceded by the 'death' of self-sufficiency. The preacher distinguishes between 'sentiment' and 'authentic emotion' by grounding the latter in the reality of suffering and the 'scruff of the neck' confrontation with one's own darkness.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The mention of 'The Princess Bride' is used as a negative example of kitsch.",
      "The potential kitsch of 'Jesus loves you' is avoided by linking it to the 'fire' of failure."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of Joni Eareckson Tada’s physical reality.",
      "The Dick Lucas anecdote about his lack of compassion for 'little lambs'."

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened primarily through the 'reframing' of failure. By arguing that Peter became a leader 'because' he was a failure, the preacher creates a 'space' where the hearer's own failures are no longer disqualifications but 'spaces for grace' (Cilliers). However, the space is somewhat narrowed by the 'mechanical' explanation of the atonement (the receipt analogy), which risks turning grace into a legal transaction rather than a mysterious encounter. The 'tension' between 'already' and 'not yet' is well-sustained in the discussion of the resurrection body.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained regarding suffering (the 'not yet' of the new body) but resolved quickly regarding the 'mechanics' of forgiveness.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'mystery' of God's presence is somewhat overshadowed by the 'clarity' of the preacher's points.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails over moralization; the 'must' is framed as a response to 'is'.",
    "recommendation": "To create more space, allow the 'mystery' of the encounter at the fire to speak for itself without over-explaining the 'achievement' of the cross."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'Apologetic-Narrative' preaching. It avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by maintaining a 'sober beauty' that takes human suffering and moral failure seriously. The 'micro-aesthetics' are characterized by linguistic precision and vivid, sensory imagery (the charcoal fire, the atrophied muscles). The 'macro-aesthetics' are driven by a compelling narrative arc that moves from the 'trouble' of Peter’s denial to the 'grace' of his restoration. While the sermon is structurally 'closed'—functioning more as a didactic 'map' than an 'open work of art'—it succeeds in 'reframing' the gospel for a contemporary, skeptical, yet anxious audience. The preacher’s 'stewardship of language' ensures that theological concepts like 'substitution' and 'justification' are not merely stated but 'imaged' through analogies like the Costco receipt. The primary aesthetic tension lies between the 'teacher' who wants to explain and the 'witness' who wants to show; in this sermon, the teacher slightly wins, but the witness provides the most memorable moments.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Vivid 'show, don't tell' imagery (Joni Eareckson Tada, the charcoal fire).",
      "Intellectual 'reframing' of ancient shame/honor culture for modern hearers.",
      "Authentic, anti-kitsch approach to suffering and moral failure."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The propositional four-point structure interrupts the narrative flow.",
      "The 'closed' nature of the conclusion leaves little room for hearer 'appropriation'.",
      "The 'Costco' analogy, while clear, lacks the aesthetic 'weight' of the rest of the sermon."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Didactic-Narrative (Sober Reformed)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Four Pages) and Johan Cilliers (Reframing), but lacks Ciska Stark's 'Openness'.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to urban, educated, and skeptical hearers who value intellectual rigor and psychological authenticity over sentimentalism.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'open' ending that leaves the hearer in the 'mystery' of the beach encounter.",
      "Try to weave the 'points' into the narrative more organically rather than listing them.",
      "Increase the 'musicality' of the language in the final 'grace' sections to match the beauty of the content."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically effective 'event' that creates a 'space for grace' by honoring both the 'strangeness' of the biblical text and the 'complexity' of human experience. Its strength lies in its precision and its refusal to offer cheap comfort. While it is more 'closed' than 'open' in its structural delivery, its 'poetic power' is found in its ability to make the 'Risen Christ' a tangible reality through the smell of fish and the pain of a broken oath. It is a 'good' to 'strong' sermon (7.2) that serves as a model for 'reframing' dogma as life-transforming narrative."
