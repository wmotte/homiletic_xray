    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in pulpit rhetoric. It moves from an Adult acknowledgment of the 'human contract' and anxiety into a Nurturing Parent comfort, and finally into a Free Child celebration. The preacher’s willingness to share his own moments of 'futility' prevents a hierarchical 'Critical Parent' dynamic. The impact is likely to be one of emotional release and reassurance rather than guilt or coerced compliance.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of transparency and vulnerability.",

      "Authentic transition into joyful, poetic expression (Free Child)."

      "Slightly heavy reliance on the 'Victim' status of humanity ('poor mortals'), which could be balanced with more 'Adult' empowerment."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'confession' of personal struggle as it grounds the Nurturing Parent role in shared Adult reality, preventing it from becoming patronizing."
