    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' common in social justice preaching. By utilizing a strong Adult ego position, the preacher processes historical and biblical data without descending into shaming (Critical Parent) or fostering dependency (Smothering Nurturing Parent). She successfully navigates the 'Bait and Switch' trap by ensuring the 'Grace' at the end is not a cover for more 'Law,' but a genuine theological resolution. The inclusion of her own past failings as a 'half-baked crusader' levels the playing field, creating a healthy Adult-Adult transaction.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of transparency and self-awareness.",
      "Avoids the 'moral superiority' trap of the Critical Parent.",
      "Empowers the congregation by highlighting existing successful Adult-led initiatives (Legal Aid, shelters)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'undeserving poor' metaphor, while theologically sound, carries a slight risk of triggering an Adapted Child (shame) response in some listeners."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue the practice of 'Self-Inclusion' in judgment. To maintain this high level of Adult engagement, ensure that the 'Free Child' (joy/spontaneity) is allowed more space to prevent the sermon from becoming overly academic."
