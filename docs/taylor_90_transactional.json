While it contains moments of Adult reflection and Free Child beauty, these are used as tools to drive the listener toward a submissive 'Adapted Child' response. The use of social 'horror stories' functions as a 'Con' in a game of 'Ain't It Awful,' creating a psychological vacuum that the preacher then fills with a Rescuer narrative.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as fellow Adults who are capable of making choices, rather than 'poor dying men.' Reduce the use of 'must' and 'had better,' and present the 'New Birth' as an invitation to autonomy rather than a rescue from a manufactured state of total helplessness."
