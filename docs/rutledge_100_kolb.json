      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a recognizable cultural observation regarding the 'timidity' of mainline denominations. However, it lacks a deeply immersive 'slice of life' that allows the hearer to feel the weight of the demonic or the desperation of the pariah. The experience is mediated through intellectual observation of church trends rather than visceral human experience.",

It explores the problem of 'neutral territory' and the necessity of a cosmic adversary to make sense of the gospel narrative.",
      "quotes": [

    "summary": "The sermon is a robust theological defense of Christ's sovereignty, functioning primarily in the Declarative and Visionary modes. It successfully diagnoses a cultural and ecclesiastical 'timidity' regarding the high Christology of the Epiphany season. The preacher excels at Abstract Conceptualization, synthesizing various biblical witnesses into a coherent 'cosmic battle' framework. However, the sermon falls short of a complete Kolb cycle due to a lack of Concrete Experience (beyond intellectual observation) and a significant absence of Active Experimentation. The hearer is given a clear 'map' of the territory but few instructions on how to 'walk' through it in their specific daily context. The tone is academic and sober, which serves the 'Assimilating' learner well but may leave the 'Converging' learner without practical handles.",

      "Use more 'Pragmatic' language to explain how the victory over Sin and Death changes Monday morning."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong example of 'teaching preaching' that prioritizes theological correctness and intellectual clarity. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon that succeeds in the tasks of Reflective Observation and Abstract Conceptualization but fails to close the loop of the learning cycle. It provides the congregation with a necessary 'Normative' correction (Osmer) but lacks the 'Pragmatic' servant-leadership required to equip them for action. The priority for improvement is the development of concrete, ethical, and practical applications that move the 'doxa' of Christ from the biblical page into the streets."
