  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a robust defense of the 'Sache' (the living Christ) against the 'Jesus Seminar' and literary reductions of Jesus. The blue side is heavily weighted toward dogmatic clarity and historical-theological polemics. There is a sophisticated handling of the distinction between the 'Jesus of history' and the 'Christ of faith,' aligning with Barthian concerns that God must remain the Acting Subject. However, the factual side occasionally borders on the academic, risking a 'lecture' feel where the congregation learns about scholarship rather than encountering the Word directly. The exegesis of Romans and Mark is precise, particularly the recovery of the 'shame' motif in the Cross, which prevents the sermon from becoming mere sentimentality.",
      "quotes": [
        "The gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God has subtly shifted into a style of story-telling about Jesus the admirable human being.",
        "The truth is that we know nothing about Jesus whatsoever except what we read in the New Testament.",
        "Christ died an unspiritual death for unspiritual people."
      ],

      "comprehensibility_check": "High, but requires a cognitively engaged congregation familiar with 'mainline' theological shifts."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a persona of a 'steadfast guardian' of the tradition. There is a notable admission of personal struggle ('the very serious doubts that frequently assail me'), which provides a diaconal quality to the 'I'—it serves to validate the listener's own doubts. The tone is sober, slightly weary of 'insidious developments,' but resolute. The self-revelation is controlled; the preacher does not use the pulpit for therapy but for testimony. There is a sense of professional concern for the 'erosion' of the church, revealing a deep-seated loyalty to the apostolic witness over modern trends.",
      "quotes": [
        "Something has been happening in the Church that seems different to me.",
        "In spite of the very serious doubts that frequently assail me...",
        "I know a couple whose son has for many years been a very high risk for suicide."

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Schizoid mix. The focus on 'theological precision' and 'correctness' (Compulsive) is paired with a certain intellectual distance and focus on the 'Sache' over emotional warmth (Schizoid).",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is largely subservient to the text, appearing primarily as a witness to the truth of the Gospel rather than an entertainer.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher/Pastor to Congregation.' There is a 'we-definition' that includes the preacher in the struggle ('Many of us have simply ignored these attacks'), but a 'you-message' emerges in the challenge ('Are you embarrassed by Jesus?'). The tone is somewhat paternalistic, warning the congregation against being 'confused and drained of energy.' The relational side is the weakest because it feels slightly 'from above,' as if the preacher is protecting a flock that might be too naive to see the 'insidious' dangers themselves. The transition to the suicide anecdote, however, softens this by moving to a level of shared human suffering.",
      "quotes": [
        "We all look pretty fixed up to me.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily a call to 'confession' and 'steadfastness.' It is a 'red' side that demands a cognitive and spiritual 'stand.' The preacher successfully avoids mere moralism (doing) by focusing on faith (being/trusting). The 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is that nothing can separate us from God's love, but it is strictly conditioned on the 'Sache' of who Jesus is. The 'Anspruch' (Demand) is to not be ashamed. The ratio is well-balanced: the demand to believe is rooted in the gift of the interceding Christ. However, the pressure on the 'appeal ear' is high—if you are ashamed, you are 'robbed' and 'Son of God will fade.'",
      "quotes": [
        "If any one would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross.",
        "Being ashamed of Jesus means being robbed of the everlasting arm of God.",
        "I pray that you today will find the Spirit moving in your spirit, saying 'I believe...'"
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Strong. The promise of Romans 8 is the foundation for the call to not be ashamed.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Low. The appeal is for faith/confession, not for social or ethical works.",
      "strengths": [
        "The appeal is existentially 'loaded' through the suicide example.",
        "Connects the ancient creed directly to personal survival."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The warning of being 'ashamed of by the Son of Man' could be balanced with more emphasis on the 'prevenient' grace that carries the doubter."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This is a substantial, intellectually rigorous sermon that prioritizes the 'Sache' of the Gospel over psychological comfort. It successfully navigates the Barthian requirement of keeping God as the Subject by grounding the hope of the believer in the objective work of the interceding Christ rather than subjective 'religious optimism.' The transition from a polemic against the 'Jesus Seminar' to the visceral reality of a family dealing with potential suicide is a masterstroke of homiletical 'grounding,' moving from the blue side (facts) to the red side (existential appeal). However, the tone is occasionally defensive, and the 'yellow' relationship with the congregation is secondary to the 'blue' transmission of doctrine. It avoids the 'depressive' trap of non-committal warmth but risks a 'compulsive' focus on theological precision. The sermon is a strong example of 'confessing' homiletics in a secularized age.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon avoids psychologization by insisting that the 'love of God' is not a generic sentiment but is tied to the objective reality of the Resurrection.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological precision and clarity.",
      "Effective use of a high-stakes pastoral illustration.",
      "Courageous 'disruption' of the congregation's 'fixed up' self-image."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce the 'seminar' style academic references.",
      "Increase relational warmth to prevent the 'guardian' persona from feeling distant.",
      "More explicit 'Zuspruch' for those who currently feel 'ashamed' or weak in faith."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively integral and theologically 'heavy' sermon that serves the text with sobriety and intellectual honesty."
