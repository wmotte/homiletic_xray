    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and promotes high levels of autonomy. By using the metaphor of a 'confirmation verse' as a 'script' (in TA terms), the preacher helps the listener identify internalized Parent tapes that limit their Free Child and Adult functioning. It successfully deconstructs toxic religious and social programming without resorting to the very same coercive tactics it critiques. The move from 'self-protection' (defensiveness) to 'transformative action' (autonomy) is a textbook example of moving from a closed script to an open, healthy life position.",
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of the 'Adult' ego state to analyze tradition.",
      "Identification of 'Social Control' as a Parent-Child dynamic.",
      "Redirection of psychological energy from defense to creativity."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Free Child' element (joy/spontaneity) is described more than it is evoked.",
      "The transition to the 'Emperor' section briefly flirts with a Critical Parent tone, though it remains focused on systemic critique."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Therapist' model where you provide the tools for interpretation rather than the final answer. This maintains the Adult-Adult transaction and prevents the congregation from falling into a dependent Adapted Child role."
