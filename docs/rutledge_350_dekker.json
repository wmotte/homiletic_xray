  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Matthew 28 as a springboard for a general defense of the Resurrection. While it touches on the angel's role, it quickly moves into a polemic against liberal theology and general 'life after death' ideas. It fails to identify what is unique to Matthew's account (the earthquake, the specific fear of the guards) that is found nowhere else, treating it instead as a generic proof-text for the event.",
      "quotes": [
        "Matthew means for it to strike us with utter, dumbfounded, stupefied awe.",
        "Note the action of the angel. Why does he roll away the stone?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more sharply on the specific 'syntax' of Matthew's account—the earthquake and the guards—to show how this specific text portrays the intrusion of God's kingdom, rather than using it to argue against modern skepticism in general."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is thin. The preacher mentions 'syntax' and 'Greek Orthodox' greetings, but there is no deep engagement with the Hebrew/Greek background or the specific theology of Matthew. The historical context is used more for dramatic effect (scruffy fishermen) than for rigorous exposition of the text's original meaning for its first readers.",
      "quotes": [
        "The syntax clearly indicates that their recognition of the risen Christ was initiated by God.",
        "their Jewish faith, based in the utterly realistic and unromantic Hebrew scriptures, would not have allowed any such vague and generic hopes."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate more rigorous scholarly exegesis of Matthew's 'apocalyptic' style. Explain why Matthew alone includes the earthquake and the guards in relation to the religious history of Israel."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is strong in its critique of the 'zeitgeist' (skepticism, liberal abstractions). It addresses the concrete reality of death (the hit-and-run driver, the smell of death). However, it remains somewhat stuck in a polemic against other preachers rather than applying the text to the specific spiritual life of the congregation's members.",
      "quotes": [
        "A great many churchgoers have gotten the idea that you can't believe in the Resurrection if you want to be a sophisticated person.",
        "I keep thinking about an inconsolably bereaved husband I knew... A hit-and-run driver has robbed him of his companion."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the 'preacher vs. skeptic' debate to show how the specific 'angelic intrusion' in the text changes the concrete daily life of the hearer today."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured more as an essay or an argument. Exposition of the text is frequently interrupted by critiques of other sermons or cultural commentary. The hearer is not so much 'drawn into the text' as they are 'drawn into a debate about the text'.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have heard and read many Easter sermons in my day and I have a lot of them in my files. Here are some actual quotes...",
        "In one sermon that I heard myself, the preacher said..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Reduce the meta-commentary on other sermons. Let the exposition of the Word itself perform the critique of the zeitgeist."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The 'misery' (death as a hostile power) is described with adequate sharpness. 'Redemption' is clearly placed outside of human capacity (God as the acting subject). 'Gratitude' is present in the concluding doxology. The sermon successfully avoids being too 'Christocentric' in a way that ignores the human condition.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have never become immune to the change that comes over the body... a hostile, invading Power.",
        "God is not the acting subject of any of the sentences [in other sermons]."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'gratitude' section by making it more than a liturgical conclusion; show how the 'new life' manifests in the believer's ethics."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "While the sermon speaks of 'victory' and 'defeat' of death, it lacks the 'two ways' regarding the hearer's responsibility. The possibility of being 'lost' (temporal or eternal) is not explicitly addressed as a consequence of the hearer's response to the message.",
      "quotes": [
        "He who sat upon it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the hearer as a 'willing and responsible being.' What does it mean to remain on the 'broad way' of death-denial versus the 'narrow way' of the Resurrection?"
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon emphasizes that the Resurrection is God's act, not a human psychological development. The doctrine of the two natures is implicit in the discussion of Christ's victory over death.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus has beaten down death, routed the hosts of Satan.",
        "The kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly connect the 'victory' of Christ to the 'grace' given to the individual sinner, rather than just the cosmic triumph."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At approximately 2200 words, the sermon meets Dekker's requirement for breadth to achieve depth. It takes the time to explore the 'stark ugliness of death' before moving to the Resurrection.",
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'breadth' is filled with more textual exposition and less anecdotal polemic."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s ideal primarily in its lack of specific textual exegesis and its tendency toward polemical meta-commentary. It spends significant time critiquing other sermons rather than 'recreating the Bible passage into a new, current, proclamatory word.' However, it strongly aligns with Dekker's requirement that God be the acting subject and that death be treated as a real, hostile power.",
    "strengths": [
      "Theologically robust rejection of human-centered 'resurrection' ideas.",
      "Adequate length (20+ mins) allowing for a serious treatment of the 'misery' of death.",
      "Strong emphasis on God as the sole actor in the Resurrection event."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient use of the specificities of the Matthew 28 text (Thesis 1).",
      "Over-reliance on anecdotes and critiques of other preachers instead of direct exposition (Thesis 4).",
      "Absence of the 'two ways'—the seriousness of the hearer's choice is not addressed (Thesis 6)."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a traceable and theologically adequate speech that defends the Gospel, but it is only partially a 'sermon' by Dekker's definition because it prioritizes general dogmatic defense over the exposition of a specific Bible passage."
