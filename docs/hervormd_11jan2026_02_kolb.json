      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a strong 'hook' regarding the life-changing impact of marriage and parenthood. It effectively uses recognizable domestic situations to evoke empathy.

      "analysis": "The preacher explores the 'problem' of resistance to change. He analyzes why people cling to the 'old world' and the discomfort of the 'new world' (AI, digital revolution). While it identifies the problem of 'tobberigheid' (worrying/fretting) in faith, it could go deeper into the psychological reasons why the Pharisees felt threatened, rather than just describing their actions.",

      "analysis": "The sermon provides a solid theological framework by connecting the 'Bridegroom' imagery to Old Testament promises (Hosea).

The call to 'pray for the Spirit' and 'talk about baptism at home' is clear, but the sermon lapses into a slightly moralistic 'admonition' (vermanen) regarding church attendance at the end, which lacks the 'how-to' guidance of a coach.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a solid, structurally sound example of Dutch Reformed preaching that successfully bridges the gap between contemporary life (parenthood, digital age) and biblical theology (Mark 2). It effectively uses a 'wedding' metaphor to challenge the 'somber' status quo of the congregation. However, it falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase, where the applications become somewhat generic and the tone shifts toward a traditional 'admonition' regarding church attendance. The 'Concrete Experience' in the introduction is strong but slightly over-extended with the addition of international politics, which dilutes the focus. The theological core is robust, providing a clear 'Big Idea' that Christ’s presence defines our current reality as a time of joy.",

      "Maintain the narrative creativity but ensure all modern examples point toward the same emotional c[plaatsnaam]."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon effectively completes most of the Kolb cycle, with a particularly strong emphasis on the transition from Concrete Experience to Abstract Conceptualization. It succeeds in making a 1st-century text relevant to a 21st-century audience by identifying a shared human resistance to radical change. The primary diagnostic finding is a 'pragmatic dip' at the end; the preacher successfully 'convinces' the hearer of the truth (Declarative) and 'inspires' them with a vision (Visionary), but the 'coaching' (Pragmatic) toward the end feels disconnected from the earlier grace-filled imagery. To improve, the preacher should ensure that the call to action flows as a natural, joyful response to the 'Bridegroom' rather than a corrective for 'tobberigheid'."
