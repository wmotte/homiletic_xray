    "risk_explanation": "The only slight risk is the 'Nurturing Parent' becoming too mystical, potentially inviting a 'Child' dependency on the 'Spirit' as a magical solution, but the Adult framing mitigates this."

    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This is a remarkably healthy sermon from a TA perspective. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent. By using the analogy of the Australian farmer, the preacher moves the congregation from a 'fear-based' (Adapted Child) religious system to a 'trust-based' (Adult/Free Child) spirituality. The preacher's willingness to admit his own shift in perspective ('If I hadn't had the year-theme in mind...') models Adult vulnerability and intellectual honesty.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the 'tijdmachine' (time machine) metaphor is a bit abrupt and could be grounded more in the 'Adult' processing of how memory and faith function.",
      "Ensure the 'internal source' doesn't lead to 'Quietism' (ignoring the Adult's need for external action/ethics)."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to share the 'how' of your thinking. When you show the congregation how you arrived at a conclusion, you empower their 'Adult' ego state rather than demanding their 'Child' ego state simply believe you."
