    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The factual side is dominated by a socio-historical and mythological interpretation of the Genesis text. The preacher contrasts the biblical flood with the Gilgamesch Epos and modern ecological/nuclear catastrophes. While the exegetical work on the 'Jahwist' and the concept of 'repentance' (Teshuvah) is present, the 'Sache' (the living Christ in Barthian terms) is often replaced by a political-ecological 'Sache'. The theological depth lies in the discussion of God's 'Being in Becoming' (Process Theology), but it risks reducing the transcendence of God to a partner in human history. The complexity of the 'Law' is interpreted almost exclusively as structural sin (social injustice), which might narrow the theological scope for a congregation seeking personal justification.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals herself as a deeply committed, politically active, and sensitive individual. There is a clear 'Selbstenthüllung' of anxiety regarding the nuclear threat and ecological collapse. The 'I' is not used for ego-inflation but as a representative of a suffering and fearful collective. However, there is a strong 'Selbstdarstellung' of the 'prophetic voice'—the preacher positions herself clearly against the 'church establishment' and 'males/patriarchy'. This creates a high level of authenticity but also a certain predictability in her theological stance. The passion is palpable, making the message 'congruent' with her persona.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ich möchte... meine Zweifel und Ängste einzubringen.",
        "Ich vermute, es gibt eine männliche Theologie, die Gott vor allem als Befehlshaber... denkt.",

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Hysterical/Depressive mix. Hysterical in the sense of seeking the 'stage' for a passionate, revolutionary cause; Depressive in the deep longing for harmony with 'Mother Earth' and the avoidance of 'hard' dogmatic distance.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' serves the cause of peace and the 'misshandled earth', though it occasionally borders on moral self-righteousness.",

        "High emotional honesty.",
        "Vulnerability regarding fear and resignation."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship to the hearer is ambivalent. On one hand, there is a strong 'We-definition' of shared victimhood and shared responsibility ('We are the ones who...'). On the other hand, the preacher adopts a 'Teaching' and 'Correcting' attitude that can feel paternalistic (or maternalistic). She divides the world into those who 'understand' (the peace movement) and those who are 'Sexists' or 'Imperialists'. This creates a 'Relationship Noise': the listener who does not share her specific political views might feel excluded or judged ('Relationship Ear' feels attacked). The tone is solidary with the 'oppressed' but sharp toward the 'undecided'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Diejenigen, die Angst davor haben... sind Sexisten.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This is the most problematic side. The sermon is heavily weighted toward 'Anspruch' (Demand). While it speaks of 'Zuspruch' (Promise), the promise is often conditioned on the human response (the 'Bund' as a 'Wechselseitigkeit'). The appeal is: Stop the arms race, change your lifestyle, recognize the 'Mother' in God. The 'Barthian Test' fails here: God often appears as a 'Motive' for human action rather than the 'Acting Subject'. The pressure on the 'Appeal Ear' is immense—the fate of the earth seems to rest on the listener's ability to 'repent' and 'act'. The Gospel risks becoming a 'New Law' of political activism.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wir müssen den eigenen Naturimperialismus verlernen.",

      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Heavily tilted toward Anspruch. The Zuspruch (Grace) is primarily found in the closing liturgy, but the body of the sermon is a call to arms (peaceful arms).",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of 'Political Homiletics'. It successfully bridges the ancient text of Genesis with the existential threats of the 20th century. However, from a Schulz von Thun perspective, it is 'Appeal-heavy', creating a significant burden for the listener. Theologically, it leans toward a 'Synergism' where the human 'Umkehr' (Repentance) is the pivot upon which the world's survival turns. While the 'Green' side (Self-revelation) is authentic and moving, the 'Yellow' side (Relationship) is marred by a polarizing 'us-vs-them' dynamic. The 'Blue' side (Factual) is intellectually stimulating but risks psychologizing and politicizing the 'Sache' of the Gospel. The final absolution provides a necessary 'Zuspruch', but it feels somewhat detached from the preceding 25 minutes of moral urgency.",
    "barthian_warning": "High risk of 'Psychologization' and 'Politicization'. God is at risk of becoming a 'Function' of the peace movement rather than the 'Wholly Other' who judges and saves apart from human activism.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Prophetic urgency and relevance.",
      "Creative use of imagery (Regenbogen vs. Atompilz).",
      "Authentic emotional engagement."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Balance the 'Anspruch' with more unconditional 'Zuspruch'.",
      "Reduce polemical labeling to improve the relational climate.",
      "Strengthen the Christological foundation of the 'New Covenant'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A rhetorically strong and passionate sermon that serves a specific political-theological 'Sache' well, but lacks the communicative balance and theological 'Rest' required for a broad congregational setting."
