    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically heavy, relying on a 'Parent-Child' dynamic that fosters dependency and existential anxiety. While theologically 'orthodox' in its apocalypticism, it utilizes fear (Critical Parent) and the 'Ain't It Awful' game to create a sense of crisis. The listener is stripped of Adult agency, told they have no capacity for self-improvement, and then offered a 'Rescue' that requires total submission to a 'Judge.' This reinforces a 'You're Not OK' life position for the listener.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of Adult data for historical context.",
      "Clear, consistent metaphorical structure."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on fear-based motivation (Critical Parent).",
      "Negation of human agency/Adult responsibility.",
      "High level of 'Drama Triangle' role-switching."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as Adult-to-Adult. Instead of emphasizing total helplessness (which invites the Victim role), invite the listener to use their Adult ego to observe how they can practically 'watch' in their daily lives. Reduce the 'Ain't It Awful' rhetoric regarding the world to avoid fostering a 'Persecutor' stance toward culture."
