    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically exemplary. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, maintaining a high degree of intellectual honesty and emotional transparency. By deconstructing the 'Persecutor God' (Vatertheologie) and refusing to play the 'Rescuer,' the preacher fosters an environment of autonomy. The use of Simone Weil provides a concrete, non-dogmatic anchor for the 'Free Child's' capacity for radical love. The impact is one of existential support rather than psychological coercion.",
