  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The sermon lacks a single underlying pericope. It functions as a thematic discourse on the Easter mystery and the person of Christ, using various Bible verses as ornaments or proof texts rather than as the source of a specific, non-reproducible word. It fails Dekker's requirement that a sermon must be the 'recreating of THAT Bible passage into a new, current word.'",
      "quotes": [
        "In the Gospel he says: 'No one puts a lamp under a basket...'",
        "It was of the patriarchs that St. Paul wrote...",
        "And his shoes represent the apostles, of whom Scripture says..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one specific pericope (e.g., the Emmaus disciples or a specific Resurrection account) and derive the entire movement of the sermon from that text alone, avoiding the 'biblical keyword' approach."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "There is no historical-critical or grammatical-historical exegesis. The text employs allegorical and dogmatic interpretation (e.g., the 'shoes' of Christ representing apostles). It does not ask what the text meant for the first readers, but immediately jumps to a symbolic, timeless meaning.",
      "quotes": [
        "His sash is formed by the prophets, whose teachings constitute the undoable knot of discipline.",
        "His shoes represent the apostles..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the original historical context of the chosen passage and utilize knowledge of the original languages to uncover the specific intent of the biblical author."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Application is largely absent or remains in the realm of general dogmatic truths. There is no engagement with the contemporary 'zeitgeist,' politics, or the specific psychological state of the modern hearer. The application is 'general,' which Dekker explicitly forbids.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let no one imagine that in his second coming he will allow us to deny that he came once before.",
        "My brothers, let us hold fast to this belief..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the specific reality of the congregation's life—their fears, the current cultural climate, or specific ethical challenges—rather than issuing general calls to 'hold fast to belief.'"
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "While the sermon is not strictly divided into two blocks, the 'interwoveness' is ineffective because there is no true exposition to begin with. The hearer is presented with a series of images rather than being 'expounded' together with the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Notice that when teaching, he is reason itself; when judging, he is the law..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Structure the sermon so that the discovery of the text's meaning (exposition) simultaneously sheds light on the hearer's current existence (application)."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The themes of misery (infirmities, vice, rebellion) and redemption (Christ as doctor, savior, victor) are present in the background. However, they are treated somewhat objectively and lack the 'human-oriented' psychological depth Dekker calls for. The 'misery' is a dogmatic category here, not a felt reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "Having come once as a doctor in order to save us...",
        "To corpses he gives living souls; to frail bodies, resurrection..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by describing the human condition in a way that the hearer recognizes their own existential or spiritual poverty before God."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "This is perhaps the strongest point in relation to Dekker's criteria. The sermon explicitly mentions the possibility of being lost and the seriousness of the judgment, presenting Christ as both Savior and 'fearsome judge.'",
      "quotes": [
        "No, he will then be a fearsome judge for all who refused to recognize him as their savior.",
        "Disbelief would make us guilty and therefore subject to his justice."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'two ways' less about a future threat and more about the 'ultimate possibilities of life design' in the present moment."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is highly Christocentric, and Christ is clearly the telos. It maintains the doctrine of the two natures (rising as God, laid in the tomb as man). However, the focus on 'meriting' eternal life at the end slightly obscures the 'living from grace' aspect Dekker emphasizes.",
      "quotes": [
        "The one Lord who is central in the sermon is Christ.",
        "so that we may merit to live eternally with our God and our Savior."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Shift the emphasis from 'meriting' to the total sufficiency of grace, ensuring Christ remains the 'salvation outside himself' for the hearer."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "At approximately 850 words, the sermon would last about 8-9 minutes. This is far below Dekker's minimum of 20 minutes. It lacks the 'breadth' required for theological and psychological depth.",
      "quotes": [
        "N/A"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the sermon significantly by providing detailed exposition of a single text and a thorough, multi-layered application to the lives of the hearers."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text fails to meet the formal definition of a sermon according to Dekker. It lacks a specific biblical pericope as its foundation, opting instead for a thematic and allegorical survey of Christological titles. The duration is insufficient for the 'depth' Dekker demands, and the application remains too general and detached from the contemporary zeitgeist. While it strongly emphasizes the 'two ways' and the central role of Christ, it functions more as a dogmatic meditation than a proclamatory word that actualizes Scripture for today.",
    "strengths": [
      "Clear Christocentric focus that upholds the two-natures doctrine.",
      "Explicit acknowledgement of the 'two ways' and the seriousness of divine judgment.",
      "Effective use of vivid imagery to describe the victory of Christ."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of a specific Bible passage as the starting point and constraint.",
      "Total absence of historical-critical exegesis.",
      "Insufficient length to achieve necessary homiletic depth.",
      "Application is general and dogmatic rather than concrete and contemporary."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is a thematic speech about 'the gospel' and 'the mysteries of Easter' rather than an exposition and application of a specific Bible passage. It lacks the necessary breadth and contemporary specificity to be considered a 'new, current, proclamatory word.'"
