    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Romans 6:5 as a springboard but quickly pivots to Isaiah 53. It fails to identify what is unique to the Romans passage that can be found nowhere else. Instead, it treats the text as a 'summation' of a general 'central commitment'.",
      "quotes": [
        "In one startling sentence that reverses the verdict of the world...",
        "The 'death like his' describes the way of his life, the nature of his earthly end."

      "improvement_point": "Isolate the specific logic of 'being planted' (symphytoi) in Romans 6 and how this specific union differs from a general 'commitment to moral integrity'."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of Greek or Hebrew study, nor of the theological context of the Roman church. The preacher uses 'Second Isaiah' as a historical-critical label but does not engage with the actual exegesis of the suffering servant in its original context.",
      "quotes": [
        "That unknown lyricist whom we call the Second Isaiah...",
        "Thus the poetry of Calvary's stark shame and fatal bruise."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The application is non-existent in a concrete sense. It remains in the realm of 'general truths' about moral integrity and the 'universe'. There is no mention of the contemporary zeitgeist, the congregation's life, or specific ethical challenges.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus went to his Calvary believing that his way would be certified and guaranteed by God.",
        "The likeness of his death represents the way of commitment of a life to faith in the moral integrity of the universe."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move from 'the universe' to the specific 'misery' or 'gratitude' of the 21st-century hearer. What does 'moral integrity' look like in a specific political or social crisis?"

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "Because both exposition and application are weak, there is no movement between them. The hearer is not 'drawn into' the text but remains a spectator to a philosophical reflection on a biblical theme.",
      "quotes": [
        "The 'death like his' represents, surely, Christ's refusal to rely on any earthly weapon..."

      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on 'shame' and 'disgrace' (misery) and 'resurrection' (redemption), but it frames them as human 'commitments' rather than God's acts. It is too objective and lacks the psychological depth Dekker requires.",

      "score_1_to_10": 1,

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Christ is the subject, but he is presented more as an example of 'moral integrity' than as the divine Savior. The 'two natures' are not felt; Christ appears as a 'believer' rather than the Lord.",

      "score_1_to_10": 1,
      "findings": "At approximately 340 words, this is a fragment, not a sermon. It lacks the 'breadth' required for 'depth'. It cannot possibly function as a sermon under Dekker's 20-minute rule.",

  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text falls fundamentally short of Dekker's definition of a sermon. It is a brief theological reflection or 'speech' rather than a proclamatory word. It lacks specific exegesis, concrete application, and the necessary length to achieve depth. It treats the Gospel as a philosophy of 'moral integrity' rather than the specific, current Word of God.",
    "strengths": [
      "The choice of Romans 6:5 provides a strong potential for a 'proclamatory word'.",
      "The connection to Isaiah 53 shows an attempt at biblical-theological synthesis."

    "weaknesses": [
      "Extreme brevity (approx. 3 minutes) precludes it from being a sermon.",
      "Reliance on 'general truths' about the 'universe' instead of concrete application.",
      "Lack of the 'two ways' and the seriousness of being lost.",
      "Reduces Christ to a 'believer' with a 'commitment' rather than the Lord of Grace."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon. It is a short thematic address. It fails the formal criteria of length and specific exposition, and the substantive criteria of the 'three parts' and 'two ways'."
