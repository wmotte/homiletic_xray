    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon lacks a strong, singular 'slice of life' narrative or an evocative opening hook that connects with the immediate emotional world of the hearer. Instead, it relies on a historical-geographical description of Athens and general references to 'New Yorkers'. While it mentions the 'marketplace', it treats it more as a conceptual space for ideas than a place of sensory experience. The emotional connection is primarily intellectualized through the lens of 'distress' or 'skepticism' rather than shared human vulnerability.",
      "quotes": [
        "When you and I hear marketplace, we think of a farmer’s market or a shopping mall. It was actually the place where all of the ideas were debated.",

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the strongest phase of the sermon. The preacher excels at pausing to ask 'why' secular people hold certain views and exploring the human condition from multiple perspectives (Atheist, Agnostic, Stoic, Epicurean). He identifies the 'problem' not as a lack of religion, but as an unrecognized reliance on unprovable faith. The cultural critique of the 'secular society that doesn't believe it has beliefs' is a sophisticated reflective move that forces the hearer to look at their own assumptions from the outside.",
      "quotes": [
        "You can’t live unless you answer some questions... but the answers to all of those questions are beliefs. Not a single one of them can be proven.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a solid theological framework, particularly in its exposition of God's transcendence and the uniqueness of the resurrection. It moves from the 'unknown god' to the 'God-sized God' and the 'heart-shaped hope'. The exegesis of Acts 17 is used to build a logical case for the Christian worldview. However, it occasionally prioritizes philosophical argumentation (Anscombe, Solovyov) over deep biblical-theological development of the text's specific phrases.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is a creator God. This is a God who’s not dependent on anything, but everything is dependent on him.",

        "Deepen the exegesis of verse 27 ('God did this so that they would seek him') to show the relational heart of the theology.",
        "Reduce the reliance on philosophical quotes to allow the biblical text's own logic to drive the conceptualization more directly."

      "homiletical_manifestations": "Manifests as systematic theological categories (Sovereignty, Resurrection, Moral Law) and logical argumentation."
    },
    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is weak in providing concrete, specific action steps. The call to 'plunge into the marketplace' and 'go and do likewise' remains largely metaphorical. While it sets an ethical direction (fearless love, dialogue), it does not facilitate the 'how' for a modern hearer. There is little guidance on how a layperson might actually engage in a 'dialegomai' at their workplace or in their neighborhood tomorrow.",
      "quotes": [

It excels in the 'Assimilating' quadrant, providing deep reflective observation and abstract conceptualization. It effectively deconstructs secular assumptions and offers a compelling theological alternative. However, it falls short in the 'Concrete Experience' and 'Active Experimentation' phases. The lack of specific, contemporary human narratives makes the 'Concrete Experience' feel more like a lecture than an encounter. Furthermore, the 'Active Experimentation' is relegated to a few general exhortations at the end, leaving the practical 'how-to' of the Christian life largely unaddressed. It is a highly 'intellectual' sermon that serves the head well but provides fewer handles for the hands.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a robust intellectual defense of the faith, perfectly suited for a skeptical, educated audience. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon that prioritizes reflection and conceptualization over experience and application. While it successfully moves the hearer to rethink their worldview, it provides limited guidance on how to live out that new understanding. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'marketplace of ideas' and the 'marketplace of daily life' through more concrete storytelling and specific practical application."
