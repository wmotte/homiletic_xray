  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and exceptionally healthy. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the 'Critical Parent' by using the 'Adult' ego state to process theological data and the 'Nurturing Parent' to validate human emotion. By emphasizing the 'body,' the preacher affirms the listener's physical reality, which counteracts the dissociative tendencies of 'spiritualizing' religion. It is a game-free communication that promotes autonomy and authentic experience.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement through historical and logical analysis.",
      "Validation of the 'Free Child' through sensory, joyful imagery.",
      "Avoidance of the Drama Triangle; the preacher does not play the Rescuer."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'hijacker' analogy is slightly jarring and could briefly trigger a 'Fear' response in the Child ego state, though it is quickly resolved by the Adult logic."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using the 'Inclusive We' to avoid the Critical Parent position. Maintain the use of concrete, sensory examples (like the 'warm hands') to keep the communication grounded in the 'Here-and-Now' Adult state."
