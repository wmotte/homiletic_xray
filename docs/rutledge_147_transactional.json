    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'High Parent' homiletics. While theologically rich in the Lutheran/Reformed tradition of Law and Gospel, it psychologically functions by breaking down the listener's Adult ego (through inductions of 'terror' and 'holy dread') to make the 'Nurturing Parent' (Grace) more palatable. This creates a cycle of dependency where the listener must feel 'awful' to feel 'blessed'.",

      "The 'Bait and Switch' from grace to terror can be psychologically jarring and manipulative."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation's Adult ego by asking how they can 'responsibly' respond to grace, rather than just 'passively' receiving it like a sleeping person in a bus terminal. Move from 'I'm telling you how bad you are' to 'Let's examine our reality together'."
