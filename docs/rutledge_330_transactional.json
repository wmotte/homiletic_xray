It begins by stroking the listener's ego ('You have chosen the better way'), then systematically dismantles their Adult defenses by labeling all human effort as 'filthy rags' or 'crutches.' By the end, the listener is reduced to a 'man with no trousers'—vulnerable, shamed, and stripped of agency. While theologically orthodox for Good Friday, the psychological impact reinforces dependency and shame rather than authentic transformation.",
