(v. 11) As you know, I did not pick these verses; they were given to me [...] The footnote comes at the end of the poem. It is a hard word with a footnote that we may receive in wisdom against all the foolishness around us. Jeremiah sees that there are very many foolish people. God is on the lookout for a few wise people who will make an effective difference.",

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon connects with concrete experience primarily through the historical trauma of 9/11 and the imagery of environmental decay. However, it lacks a specific, localized narrative of a contemporary individual's life. The 'experience' is largely collective and historical rather than personal and immediate. It succeeds in evoking the 'feeling' of being out of control, but remains somewhat detached by focusing on 'poetry' as the medium of experience.",
      "quotes": [
        "It felt, in ancient Jerusalem, like the coming down of the Twin Towers.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This phase is well-developed through the analysis of 'narcotization' and 'denial.' The preacher explores the human condition of being 'foolish'—defined here as living as if God does not exist, whether in arrogance or despair. It pauses to ask why the people of Jerusalem (and by extension, the modern hearer) do not notice the 'big trouble.' It offers a clear cultural critique of modern indifference.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon offers a strong theological framework centered on the 'adversative conjunction'—the 'Yet' of God. It engages in solid exegesis of the Hebrew poetic structure ('I looked' four times) and the character of God as one who reverses field. It successfully connects the harshness of Jeremiah with the grace of the Gospel (lost sheep/coin). The 'big idea' is the persistence of God's presence beyond judgment.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of visionary and theological preaching that fails to bridge the gap into concrete practice. It begins with a powerful connection to a collective trauma (9/11) and uses this to explore the biblical text's 'wild imagery.' The preacher effectively diagnoses the human condition as one of 'narcotized denial,' categorizing it into arrogance and despair. The theological 'big idea'—the 'Yet' of God—is clearly articulated and provides a robust foundation for hope. However, the sermon explicitly shies away from 'application,' which results in a truncated learning cycle. The 'Active Experimentation' phase is left to generalities like 'changed conduct' without specific guidance. This serves the 'Assimilating' and 'Diverging' learners well but leaves the 'Converging' and 'Accommodating' learners without a clear response.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a high-quality theological and poetic reflection that succeeds in 'interrupting' the hearer's life with the reality of God. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon—strong on reflection and conceptualization but weak on application. The preacher's resistance to 'application' is a homiletical choice that preserves the 'wildness' of the text but at the cost of the hearer's practical transformation. To reach a score of 8 or higher, the sermon would need to translate its profound theological 'Yet' into the 'How' of daily discipleship. It remains a clear, effective, and sober analysis of the human condition under the judgment and grace of God."
