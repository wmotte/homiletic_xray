    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon begins with a high degree of empathy (Nurturing Parent), acknowledging the genuine hardships of the human condition. However, it quickly devolves into a Parent-Child dynamic where the preacher shames the congregation for their lack of emotional 'performance.' By framing the Christian life as a military hierarchy, the preacher reinforces dependency and suppresses the Adult ego. The shift from 'I feel for you' to 'You are boring me with your coldness' is a classic psychological switch that leaves the listener in a state of 'Adapted Child' guilt.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of imagery and metaphor to create emotional resonance.",
      "Effective identification of universal human struggles (the 'tough times')."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "High level of shaming/coercion regarding emotional expression.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult engagement; the listener is a passive recipient of commands."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try moving from the 'Commander/Soldier' (P-C) model to a 'Wayfarer/Companion' (A-A) model. Instead of demanding enthusiasm, ask the congregation to reflect on what prevents them from feeling joy. Replace 'must' and 'ought' with observations and invitations."
