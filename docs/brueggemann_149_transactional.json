    "summary": "This sermon is an excellent example of Adult-to-Adult communication. It avoids the common Lenten trap of using the Critical Parent to induce guilt. Instead, it uses the Adult ego state to analyze the 'protocols' of the biblical world and the contemporary world. It identifies the 'hard heart' not as a moral failure to be punished, but as a psychological and systemic rigidity that prevents 'bodily restoration.' The preacher empowers the listener by presenting the gospel as a choice of roles rather than a set of demands.",

      "Strong use of Adult ego state to analyze social structures.",

      "The universalization of 'disability' ('everybody here has a disability') could be seen as a slight Nurturing Parent 'smothering' of the specific reality of the man in the text."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Drama' metaphor; it naturally keeps the preacher in the Adult 'Observer' role and prevents the 'Persecutor' or 'Rescuer' roles from taking over the pulpit."
