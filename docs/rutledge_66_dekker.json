    "sermon_start_end": "WHEN I was in theological seminary thirty-five years ago, it was taken for granted by most biblical scholars that the Song of Songs was a collection of erotic wedding poems, without reference to God or the spiritual realm. [...] God is faithful to us, beyond our deserving, even unto the Resurrection to eternal life, for “my Love, the Crucified, is raised to life this morrow.” He welcomes you to his banqueting table; his banner over you is love. AMEN."

    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to focus on one specific pericope. It treats 'the Song' as a general theme, jumping between various verses (8:6, 2:4) and other biblical books (Proverbs, Genesis, Mark). It fails to identify what is unique to a specific text that can be found nowhere else.",

      "improvement_point": "Select one specific pericope (e.g., Song 8:6-7) and exhaust its unique theological contribution instead of providing a thematic survey."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is awareness of the historical-critical vs. allegorical debate, but actual linguistic or historical-contextual exegesis of the Hebrew text is replaced by a history of interpretation (Bede, William of St. Thierry). The preacher relies on secondary authorities rather than direct exposition of the text's original meaning.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Venerable Bede... wrote, 'This Song testifies … that it intends nothing fleshly or literal'",
        "As many commentators on the Hebrew text observe, a distinction between secular and sacred is foreign to the Hebrew mind."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Engage directly with the Hebrew imagery and the specific cultural-historical setting of the Song's poetry rather than relying on medieval allegorical shortcuts."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the 'zeitgeist' (the Anscombe Society at Princeton, Jane Fonda), which Dekker values. However, it often veers into personal anecdote (youth ministry in the 70s) rather than a sharp application of the Word to the hearer's spiritual misery or redemption.",
      "quotes": [
        "with the soda and the chips was a bowl of flavored condoms.",
        "Jane Fonda published her autobiography a couple of years ago. It is full of explicit detail."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured more like a lecture or a 'talk' than a proclamatory movement. Exposition (via Bede) and application (via Princeton/Fonda) are distinct blocks. The hearer is not 'drawn into the text' so much as told about the text's history.",
      "quotes": [
        "I need to set the stage for you. This was back in the seventies...",
        "So now I address you who are parents of, or counselors to..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Synthesize the biblical imagery directly with the contemporary struggle so that the text itself 'expounds' the hearer."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The 'misery' of sexual transgression is mentioned, and 'gratitude' is present in the form of faithful marriage. However, the connection to the Heidelberg categories is loose. The sermon leans toward the 'objective' and 'psychological' rather than the man-before-God drama Dekker requires.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is astute psychology. Insight, in this case, requires us to acknowledge the universal lure of the forbidden",
        "the grace of God is retroactive."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by showing how the distortion of eros is a form of being 'lost before God,' not just a lack of 'dignity'."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon explicitly mentions the 'two ways' via Proverbs (the way of insight vs. the house of Sheol). It takes the hearer's choices seriously, particularly regarding sexual ethics. However, it softens the 'eternal loss' aspect into a discussion of 'respect' and 'dignity'.",
      "quotes": [
        "But he does not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.",
        "Dignity itself is a moral standard."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Clarify the 'ultimate possibilities' of the life design—being lost in time vs. eternity—rather than framing it primarily as a cultural/moral choice."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, particularly through the lens of the Incarnation (Bede) and the Resurrection. The doctrine of the two natures is implicit in the discussion of the Word becoming flesh to 'embrace us.' Grace is presented as the final word.",
      "quotes": [
        "the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us... to live 'outside' with us mortal men and women, and to embrace us.",
        "my Love, the Crucified, is raised to life this morrow."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure Christ is not just an allegorical 'interpretation' added to the text, but the necessary 'telos' that the specific Scripture passage demands."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 1950 words, the sermon barely hits the 20-minute threshold. However, the 'breadth' is filled with anecdotes and historical surveys rather than the 'depth' of the specific Word of God. It lacks the 'proclamatory' weight Dekker seeks.",
      "improvement_point": "Reduce anecdotal 'stage-setting' and increase the density of scriptural exposition to achieve true 'depth'."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily due to its lack of focus on a specific Bible passage, opting instead for a thematic and historical survey. It relies heavily on secondary authorities (Bede, Davis) and personal anecdotes, which dilutes the 'proclamatory' nature of the Word. While it successfully engages the zeitgeist and maintains Christ as the telos, it functions more as a theological lecture on eros than a sermon that recreates a specific text into a current word.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong awareness of the zeitgeist and contemporary cultural challenges regarding sexuality.",
      "Clear Christocentric focus, maintaining the 'One Lord' as the goal of the discourse.",
      "Adequate use of the 'Two Ways' through the contrast of Wisdom and Folly in Proverbs."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specificity: The sermon treats 'selections' rather than a single pericope, violating Thesis 1.3.",
      "Over-reliance on anecdotes: Personal memories and cultural commentary occupy space that should be reserved for the 'depth' of the Word.",
      "Separation of exposition and application: The movement between 'what the text meant' and 'what it means today' is disjointed."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate theological address, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict sense of Dekker’s definition. It lacks the specific scriptural grounding and the interwoven 'actualization' required to be a form of the Word of God."
