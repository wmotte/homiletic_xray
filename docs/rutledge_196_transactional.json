  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Redemptive Cruelty.' While it uses high-register theological language and themes of love, it psychologically anchors the listener in a state of 'I'm Not OK - You're OK (God/Preacher).' It reinforces dependency by suggesting that mental health or self-regard ('domestic idea of God') is a barrier to true faith. The transition from the 'Nurturing Parent' (God as the parent of a drug addict) to the 'Critical Parent' (God as the one who notes what is done amiss) creates a confusing psychological environment where love is inextricably tied to shame.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on shame-based identity ('miserable offenders').",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult empowerment; the listener is kept in a passive, 'rescued' position."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as Adult subjects capable of choosing goodness, rather than 'miserable' objects of rescue. Reduce the use of 'must' and 'ought' regarding how they should feel about their own 'wretchedness.' Allow the 'Free Child' to experience God without the prerequisite of 'Critical Parent' shaming."
