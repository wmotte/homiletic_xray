    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes strong, evocative imagery, particularly in the middle section regarding Peter's restoration. The preacher effectively 'paints the scene' of the beach breakfast, moving beyond abstract forgiveness to the physical sensation of guilt. The use of the Gerard Manley Hopkins quote provides a visceral, sensory metaphor for the self-loathing of sin ('bitter taste'). However, the opening third relies heavily on journalistic reportage and proper names, which, while concrete, functions more as 'telling' news than 'showing' biblical truth. The transition to the 'pure oxygen' of the Resurrection is a high point of poetic imagery that bridges the gap between the historical and the experiential.",
      "quotes": [
        "In those days just after the Resurrection it must have been like breathing pure oxygen.",
        "Peter must have choked on the food; the words of Gerard Manley Hopkins... Bitter would have me taste: my taste was me.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "The sermon balances 'telling' (reporting on Charlie Ward/McVeigh) with 'showing' (Peter's internal distress and the physical act of eating). It leans toward 'showing' in the theological core."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and avoids 'Canaanite' jargon. The preacher carefully navigates the sensitive theological terrain of Jewish-Christian relations, using terms like 'Shoah' and 'Sanhedrin' with historical awareness. There is a clear 'stewardship of language' in how the preacher defines 'shame' versus 'guilt' and 'justification'. The word choice is sophisticated yet accessible, reflecting the intellectual context of Greenwich Village. The preacher avoids platitudes, instead opting for nuanced descriptions of human failure, such as the 'blue wall of silence' or 'snitching', which grounds the theological concept of betrayal in contemporary reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "The book of Acts and the Gospel of John... are particularly given to negative statements about 'the Jews,' which have led over the years to the idea that the Jews were uniquely guilty.",
        "Peter is not only forgiven, you see; he is completely made new; to use the word of the Apostle Paul, he is justified.",

        "Some contemporary references (Don Imus) have aged and may now obscure the precision for a modern reader.",

      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Theological terms like 'justification' and 'apostolate' are used, but they are contextualized within the narrative of Peter's life, making them clear."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a steady, oratorical rhythm, but it occasionally suffers from 'paper language' in the sections where the preacher quotes news reports or lists historical events. The cadence improves significantly in the second half, where the repetition of Jesus’ question to Peter creates a liturgical rhythm. The use of staccato sentences ('I’m going fishing', 'He is now to carry...') provides necessary pauses. However, the lengthy introductory paragraphs read more like an essay than a spoken performance, lacking the rhythmic 'flow' found in the Hopkins-inspired section. The ending returns to a strong, rhythmic invitation suitable for the oral event of the Mass.",
      "quotes": [
        "No crime so atrocious, no shame so abysmal, no failure so profound.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7,
    "summary_language": "The language of the sermon is characterized by a high degree of precision and intellectual rigor. It successfully avoids religious kitsch by grounding the concept of sin in the visceral 'bitter taste' of the self. While the initial sections are somewhat bogged down by journalistic detail, the poetic quality of the Hopkins reference and the rhythmic repetition of the Johannine dialogue elevate the text. It is a 'sober-Reformed' style of language that respects the intelligence of the hearer while remaining transparent to the biblical text."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear, albeit complex, narrative arc. It begins with a 'captatio benevolentiae' that transitions into a 'trouble' (the historical and contemporary problem of anti-Semitism and betrayal). The 'upsetting of equilibrium' occurs when the preacher moves from the external 'Jews killed Jesus' to the internal 'we all killed him'. The plot then narrows to the specific story of Peter, which serves as a microcosm for the human condition. The turning point is the breakfast on the beach—the movement from the 'bitter taste' of self to the 'commission' of grace. The energy remains high until the end, culminating in the invitation to the Eucharist.",
      "quotes": [
        "Who killed Jesus? All of us sinners killed him.",
        "Peter must have understood that Jesus forgave him... but how was Peter ever to hold his head up again?",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. The preacher masterfully 'reframes' the biblical text (John 21) through the lens of contemporary issues: the Shoah, the death penalty, and the 'blue wall of silence'. By using the concept of 'snitching' and 'betrayal', the preacher makes Peter’s ancient denial feel contemporary and urgent. The contextual references are not merely 'illustrations' but are woven into the theological argument. The 'reframing' occurs when the preacher challenges the hearer to see themselves not as spectators of Peter's failure, but as participants in the 'bitter taste' of their own sin, which is then reframed by the 'Space for Grace'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Multiply these attitudes toward betrayal by an infinite number to get an idea of Peter's guilt.",
        "Like many nonreligious people I harbor a secret, lingering desire to be persuaded.",
        "Do you see yourself... as the final arbiter of 'God's most deep decree'? Or have you tasted yourself?"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Surprising and natural connections between 1st-century denial and 21st-century 'snitching'.",
        "The sermon respects the 'strangeness' of the text while making it relevant.",
        "Excellent use of contemporary cultural critics (Steinfels, Mendelsohn) to frame the gospel."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection to Bishop Belo and East Timor feels a bit dated and 'list-like'.",
        "The transition from the 'Sanhedrin' discussion to the 'fishing' story could be smoother.",
        "Ensure the context of a Catholic church is even more deeply integrated into the 'reframing' of the Eucharist."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes. It reframes 'betrayal' from a moral failure into an opportunity for 're-creation' and 'justification'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is largely an 'open work of art' in its middle section, where it explores the ambivalence of Peter's shame. It acknowledges the difficulty of the 'negative references' in the Bible without offering a cheap solution. However, the conclusion leans toward a more 'closed' structure. While the invitation to the Sacrament is beautiful, the final series of 'He does not ask...' statements, while rhetorically powerful, leaves less room for the hearer's own struggle, moving into a more traditional 'declarative' mode. The sermon is polyvalent in its handling of history but more monovalent in its final theological application.",
      "quotes": [
        "There really may not be any satisfactory way of dealing with these negative references.",
        "Peter was distressed... What more can Peter say?",
        "There is not one person here today who cannot answer that question with a full heart."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Honest admission of theological difficulties (anti-Semitism in the text).",
        "The use of the 'bitter taste' leaves room for the hearer's own specific experiences of shame.",
        "The ending is an invitation, not a command."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The claim that 'not one person' cannot answer with a full heart might be too coercive for someone in deep doubt.",
        "Leave more room for the 'silence' of the beach before the restoration.",
        "The resolution of the 'Jewish guilt' issue feels a bit 'sealed shut' by the 'we are all sinners' trope."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily open in its exploration of human failure, but closes somewhat in its rhetorical certainty at the end."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon exhibits a strong dramaturgical progression from the macro-historical to the micro-existential. The integration of contemporary context is sophisticated, avoiding the 'kitsch' of easy analogies. The narrative arc effectively sustains the tension of Peter's shame before offering the resolution of grace. While the introduction is slightly over-extended and the conclusion becomes highly declarative, the overall structure succeeds in 'reframing' the biblical narrative as a contemporary event of 're-creation'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by dwelling on the 'bitter taste' of the self and the 'painful way' of the Pope. It does not offer immediate comfort; instead, it takes the pain of the Shoah and the agony of betrayal seriously. The use of the 'blue wall of silence' and the McVeigh execution prevents the sermon from becoming a sentimental story about a 'nice Jesus'. The emotion is authentic because it is rooted in the 'atrocious' and the 'abysmal'. The preacher refuses to 'smooth over' the negative references in the text, which is an anti-kitsch stance.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The slightly idealized description of Peter as an 'adored child' whose utterances were 'too cute for words' (borderline sentimentality).",
      "The 'pure oxygen' metaphor is slightly leaning toward the 'sublime' kitsch, though it works in context."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of Peter 'choking' on his breakfast while facing the one he denied.",
      "The inclusion of the non-religious critic's 'secret, lingering desire to be persuaded'.",
      "The refusal to give a 'satisfactory way' of dealing with difficult texts."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the focus on the 'bitter taste' and avoid the 'adored child' psychologizing of biblical characters to keep the aesthetic depth sharp."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened through the concept of 're-creation'. By emphasizing that Peter is 'justified' and 'made new' despite an 'atrocious crime', the preacher moves beyond moralism. The sermon rejects the 'rules' and 'credits' (moralization) in favor of the 'love of the Savior' (grace). However, the space is slightly constricted by the heavy journalistic framing at the start, which keeps the hearer in the 'horizontal' world of news for a long time before moving to the 'vertical' space of grace.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between Peter's shame and Jesus' love is the heart of the sermon.",
    "mystery_respected": "Partially; the preacher explains 'justification' clearly but leaves the 'mystery' of why Jesus asks three times as a point of 'distress'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. The sermon explicitly rejects 'obeying the rules' as the basis for the encounter.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'Space for Grace' to emerge earlier in the sermon to balance the heavy historical/contextual load."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'Reframing' (Cilliers) and 'Stewardship of Language' (McEntyre). It avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by refusing to offer easy answers to the problem of biblical anti-Semitism or the depth of human betrayal. The aesthetic power lies in its 'sober beauty'—the ability to connect the 'bitter taste' of the human condition with the 'pure oxygen' of the Resurrection. The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long), pointing to the transformed lives of others (Bud Welch, the nuns) as the primary aesthetic evidence of the Gospel. While the structure is somewhat front-heavy with reportage, the core narrative of Peter is handled with poetic sensitivity and psychological depth. It is a sermon that respects the 'intellectual circles' of its New York context while remaining firmly rooted in the radicality of the Reformed/Protestant understanding of grace.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Sophisticated integration of contemporary context and biblical text (Reframing).",
      "Visceral, sensory imagery regarding sin and shame (The 'bitter taste').",
      "Intellectual honesty and avoidance of religious kitsch."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The introduction is too long and journalistic, delaying the 'aesthetic turn' to the text.",
      "The oratorical rhythm is occasionally interrupted by 'paper language' and citations.",
      "The conclusion is slightly too 'closed' and declarative, potentially overwhelming the 'open' interpretation."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Intellectual-Imagistic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Four Pages).",
    "audience_analysis": "Intellectually engaged, urban, socially conscious hearers who are skeptical of 'easy' religion but hungry for authentic 'persuasion'.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Shorten the 'captatio' and historical reportage to allow the biblical imagery more room to breathe.",
      "Experiment with more 'open' endings that leave the hearer with the question 'Do you love me?'",
      "Increase the musicality of the prose in the explanatory sections to match the poetic quality of the core narrative."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically successful sermon that achieves 'depth' through the rejection of sentimentality. It effectively uses the 'aesthetic turn' to move the hearer from being a spectator of history to a participant in the drama of grace. The score of 7.2 reflects a high-quality performance that excels in integration and imagery, though it remains slightly bound by its own intellectual/journalistic framework."
