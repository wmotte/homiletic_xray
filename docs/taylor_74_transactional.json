    "summary": "The sermon is rhetorically brilliant but psychologically regressive. It relies heavily on a Critical Parent ego state to establish authority by shaming modern culture and secularism. While it offers a Nurturing Parent payoff at the end, the transition is a 'Bait and Switch'—using the law/judgment to make the grace feel like a rescue from a self-created crisis of shame. The listener is rarely addressed as an Adult capable of independent reflection, but rather as a Child who must either be scolded or comforted.",

Reduce the use of dismissive labels (swill, rubbish) to avoid the 'Ain't It Awful' game."
