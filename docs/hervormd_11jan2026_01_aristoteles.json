Een tafel waarover in de onderwijzing die we nog zullen horen, wordt gezegd dat we er door Christus zelf toe worden uitgenodigd. [...] U hoeft zelf niets mee te brengen. U hoeft zelf niets gedaan te hebben. De grenzen zijn geslecht. U hoeft alleen maar te komen op de stem van Hem die roept: 'Kom, kom, want alle dingen zijn gereed.' Amen.",

  "aristotelian_modes_analysis": {
    "logos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The rational architecture follows a narrative-exegetical path. The preacher moves from the immediate context of the Lord's Supper to the text of John 2, then through a verse-by-verse exposition, concluding with a return to the invitation of the table. The logical core rests on the concept of the 'prototype'—the idea that this first sign contains the essence of all Christ's work. However, the logic occasionally feels associative rather than strictly argumentative. For instance, the connection between the 'large group of friends' causing the wine shortage is presented as a 'nice thought' rather than a textual necessity, which slightly weakens the exegetical rigor.",
      "quotes": [
        "Daar wordt gezegd dat Kana het eerste teken is. Het prototype. Uit dat ene teken, wat daar gebeurt, kun je alle andere tekenen als het ware afleiden.",
        "Als die moeder staat voor de synagoge, voor de Joodse traditie, zou deze afstand dan ook niet daarmee te maken kunnen hebben?",
        "Het water van de reiniging wordt wijn... Dat wat de grenzen aangaf, het reinigingsritueel, wordt getransformeerd in wijn."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear thematic link between the 'first sign' and the 'final hour'.",
        "Effective use of the 'prototype' concept to unify the sermon's logic.",
        "Traceable transition from the historical setting (Galilee) to the symbolic meaning."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Strengthen the causal link between the symbolic interpretation of the mother and the actual text.",
        "Clarify the transition between the 'distance from parents' and 'distance from tradition' to avoid logical leaps.",
        "Provide more explicit logical grounding for the 'friends of Jesus' causing the wine shortage."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The Logos is functional and traceable, though it relies heavily on symbolic allegory which may feel less 'proven' to a critical listener."
    },
    "pathos": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The emotional resonance is present but subdued. The preacher uses sensory language regarding the wine and the feast, but the tone remains largely instructional. There is an attempt to bridge the text to the hearer's existential reality (doubts, sins, feelings of belonging), but it often stays at a descriptive level ('Imagine...'). The 'pathos of the heart' is most visible in the conclusion, where the invitation is extended to the 'sinner' and the 'doubter', yet the middle section of the sermon is intellectually heavy, which cools the emotional temperature.",
      "emotional_tone": "Inviting, serious, and moderately celebratory.",
      "quotes": [
        "De maaltijd: een vreugdemal, een feestmaaltijd. De wijn verheugt het hart.",
        "Het beeld dat wij van Jezus hebben is altijd te klein. Het kan altijd weer anders, weer verrassend.",
        "Of u nou rein en heilig bent, of u nou heel gelovig bent of er altijd maar aan twijfelt."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Good use of the imagery of the 'open table' to create a sense of welcome.",
        "Effective contrast between the 'smell of the world' (Galilee) and the 'holiness of the temple'.",
        "Warm, inclusive closing appeal."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Increase the use of 'vivid description' (hypotyposis) during the wedding scene to make the crisis palpable.",
        "Deepen the emotional stakes of the 'wine running out'—what does that despair feel like today?",
        "Vary the vocal/tonal energy more explicitly between the 'hard' distance of Jesus and the 'joy' of the miracle."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Pathos is sufficient for a liturgical setting but lacks the 'affective fire' needed to truly move a modern audience beyond cognitive agreement."
    },
    "ethos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher establishes strong credibility by positioning themselves as a fellow traveler and witness rather than a moral superior. By using 'we' and 'us' frequently, the speaker shares the vulnerability of having a 'too small' image of Jesus. The authority claimed is derived from the text and the office of the 'inviter' to the table, which fits the liturgical context perfectly. There is a palpable sense of sincerity and submission to the sovereignty of Christ, which enhances the preacher's integrity.",
      "authenticity": "High. The preacher admits to the 'strangeness' of the story and the limitations of human understanding.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ook wij hebben Hem niet in onze macht. Wij hebben geen greep op Hem.",
        "Mogen wij vol verwondering kijken waar Hij ons brengt, Hem volgend, leerling zijn.",
        "Het beeld dat wij van Jezus hebben is altijd te klein."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Avoidance of moralizing; the preacher stands under the same grace as the congregation.",
        "Authentic humility regarding the mystery of the sacrament.",
        "Clear 'witness' stance rather than 'lecturer' stance."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Include a brief personal reflection on a moment of 'running out of wine' to deepen the personal witness.",
        "Be more direct about the preacher's own struggle with the 'hard words' of Jesus to the mother.",
        "Clarify the 'authority' of the interpretation of the mother as Synagogue—is this the preacher's insight or the Church's tradition?"
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Ethos is the strongest element; the preacher comes across as a reliable, humble, and Christ-centered guide."

    "dominant_mode": "Ethos",
    "suppressed_mode": "Pathos",
    "balance_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon is well-balanced for a traditional liturgical setting but leans heavily on the credibility of the speaker (Ethos) and the internal logic of the symbols (Logos). Pathos is the 'quietest' of the three. The preacher successfully uses Ethos to bridge the gap between a complex symbolic reading of John and the practical act of Communion. However, the lack of intense Pathos means the 'joy' of the wedding feast is discussed more than it is felt.",
    "consequences_of_imbalance": [
      "The hearer understands the 'why' and 'how' but might not feel the 'wow' of the miracle.",
      "Intellectual hearers will appreciate the symbolic depth, but those seeking emotional comfort may find it a bit distant.",
      "The risk is that the sermon remains a 'teaching moment' rather than a 'transformative encounter'."
    ],
    "recommendation_for_balance": "Inject more sensory and narrative tension into the middle of the sermon to raise the Pathos to the level of the Ethos."

    "orthopathy_pathos": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "While it encourages 'wonder', the sermon doesn't fully ignite the 'God-fearing joy' or the 'desperation of the shortage' as deeply as it could."

    "orthopraxy_ethos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher models a life of 'following' and 'looking' rather than 'controlling' or 'knowing better', which is a strong form of orthopraxy."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_rhetorical_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a solid, intellectually engaging sermon that excels in establishing a credible and humble pastoral voice (Ethos). It successfully navigates a difficult Johannine text by using the 'prototype' framework to connect a first-century wedding to a 21st-century Communion service. The Logos is clear and the symbolic interpretation of the mother as the Synagogue is handled with theological sophistication. However, the sermon is rhetorically 'cool'. It prioritizes teaching and symbolic decoding over emotional impact. While it avoids the pitfall of manipulation, it also misses the opportunity to make the 'joy of the wine' a visceral experience for the congregation. It is a 'good' sermon that functions well within its liturgical context but does not reach the level of a 'model' sermon due to its lower affective resonance.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Theological depth in interpreting the 'six stone jars' as the transformation of the law into joy.",
      "Strong pastoral Ethos that invites the congregation without being overbearing.",
      "Coherent connection between the text and the immediate liturgical act of Holy Communion."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase the use of sensory metaphors to strengthen Pathos.",
      "Reduce the reliance on allegorical 'could it be' questions in favor of more direct logical assertions.",
      "Create more narrative tension before revealing the 'solution' of the miracle."
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Witnessing-Visionary (focusing on seeing the 'signs' and following the 'sovereign Lord').",
    "audience_analysis": "Most appealing to established church members with an interest in biblical symbolism and a preference for a calm, dignified pastoral style.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'narrative-first' approach to increase Pathos.",
      "Use more concrete 'slices of life' to illustrate the theological concepts.",
      "Challenge the audience more directly on their 'small images of Jesus'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a competent example of modern reformed preaching. It scores a 6.5 overall because it fulfills its purpose with integrity and clarity but lacks the rhetorical 'spark' (Pathos) to move from a good teaching to a truly memorable proclamation. Its strength lies in its Ethos—the preacher is a trustworthy guide through the symbolic world of John."
