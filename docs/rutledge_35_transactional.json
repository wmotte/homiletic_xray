    "risk_explanation": "The only potential double bottom is the use of Bonhoeffer to critique 'acting' in the pulpit, which could be a subtle P->C correction of the ordinand's professional background, though it is framed as Adult instruction."

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The preacher avoids 'ITHY' (I'm Only Trying To Help You) by refusing to provide a 'help' that doesn't work. She avoids 'Ain't It Awful' by moving from the tragedy to a rigorous Adult analysis of the Word rather than staying in passive lament."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a rare example of psychologically healthy homiletics in the face of trauma. By operating from the Adult ego state, the preacher avoids the trap of becoming a 'Rescuer' who offers false hope or a 'Critical Parent' who explains away suffering as divine judgment. She validates the 'Free Child's' capacity for lament while using the 'Adult' to process the theological implications of the 'bottom of the night.' The use of Bonhoeffer serves as a meta-commentary on TA: the reader must not 'identify himself with God' (Parent), but 'serve Him' (Adult/Child).",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of reality-testing regarding the Sandy Hook tragedy.",
      "Refusal to engage in manipulative 'Games' of easy comfort.",
      "Clear distinction between the human messenger and the Divine word."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the tragedy to the technicalities of 'how to read the Bible' could feel like an Adult 'withdrawal' from the intensity of the Child's pain.",
      "The quote about God 'doing whatever he pleases' could inadvertently trigger a Critical Parent image of God if not carefully balanced."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name the 'Void' and the 'absence' as you did here. By acknowledging the limits of your own ego (Not to us, O Lord), you prevent the formation of a Drama Triangle where the preacher is the hero."
