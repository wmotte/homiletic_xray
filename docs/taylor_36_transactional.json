It risks pathologizing human reason as 'arrogant pride.'",

      "Validates the listener's feelings of inadequacy and exhaustion.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on the Child-Parent dynamic.",
      "Potential to stifle the listener's 'Adult' ego by labeling intellectual inquiry as 'arrogance.'",
      "The 'Switch' from comfort to a mild threat ('God help us if we do not') creates unnecessary anxiety."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Incorporate more Adult-to-Adult transactions. Instead of just 'surrender,' invite the congregation to 'reflect' and 'evaluate' how their faith interacts with reality. Encourage the 'Free Child's' joy without requiring the 'Adapted Child's' total helplessness."
