  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The 'Sache' of the sermon is the missed opportunity for divine encounter (kairos). The preacher utilizes the Lukan account of Jesus weeping over Jerusalem. Theologically, the content leans heavily on the historical-linear memory of Jerusalem (Isaiah, Jeremiah, David) to establish a pattern of divine presence. However, the exegetical depth is somewhat thin; the 'blue' side serves primarily as a springboard for emotional and national analogies rather than a rigorous dogmatic exploration of Christology or the nature of judgment. The 'Sache' of the living Christ (Barth) is present but risks being reduced to a 'loving Savior' whose primary attribute is sadness rather than the sovereign Word that both judges and justifies.",
      "quotes": [
        "Through her streets had walked the prophet Isaiah.",
        "The lament of Jeremiah was native to its streets and lanes.",
        "because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear historical continuity established between the Old Testament and the life of Jesus.",
        "Strong use of cultural and literary touchstones to illustrate 'sadness'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Deepen the Christological 'Sache'; move beyond the 'weeping Savior' to the 'Acting Subject' of God's grace.",
        "Clarify the 'things that make for peace' beyond general spiritual concepts."
      ],
      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The language is accessible, though the transition from Jerusalem to 1950s-era American patriotism requires a leap of logic."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a soul deeply attuned to the aesthetic and the melancholic. There is a conscious 'Selbstdarstellung' of a cultured, sensitive leader who appreciates Handel, Bryant, and Tennyson. This 'green' side signals a high value on emotional resonance and cultural literacy. However, there is a slight 'leak' of what Denecke might call the 'Depressive' type—not in the clinical sense, but in the homiletical tendency to seek harmony through shared pathos and a longing for 'closeness' with the divine through feeling. The preacher’s 'I' is largely diaconal, serving as a bridge of empathy for the congregation, though the aesthetic references occasionally border on 'Hysterical' stage-seeking (using the pulpit to showcase personal taste).",
      "quotes": [
        "I never read Bryant's 'Thanatopsis' or Tennyson's 'In Memoriam' without a strange shiver passing through me.",
        "Who can hear 'I feel like a motherless child' ... without an involuntary feeling of poignancy?",
        "We have not known what belongs unto our peace."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive/Hysterical mix. The preacher seeks connection through shared emotion (Depressive) and uses dramatic, poetic language to command the space (Hysterical).",
      "diaconal_quality": "Generally high; the preacher uses his own sensitivity to help the congregation feel the weight of the text.",
      "strengths": [
        "Authentic emotional engagement with the theme of lament.",
        "Vulnerability in admitting the 'shifting scenes of stress and strain' in history."

        "Ensure personal aesthetic tastes do not overshadow the starkness of the Gospel.",
        "Avoid 'we-definitions' that assume everyone shares the same emotional triggers."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined by a 'solidary' and 'paternalistic' tone. The preacher speaks as a co-traveler ('we', 'our poor flesh') but also as a guide who interprets the 'signs of the times' for the nation and the individual. There is a strong 'You-message' in the latter half, moving from the 'We' of the nation to the 'You' of the individual home and heart. The relationship noise is low, though the transition to Independence Day Sunday creates a specific 'We-definition' (American citizens) that might exclude or pressure those who do not share that nationalistic fervor. The tone is one of urgent invitation rather than authoritarian demand.",
      "quotes": [
        "I wish this nation could realize that God has not given us all this for nothing.",
        "For some of you, there have been so many times that God has visited and sought you.",

      "strengths": [
        "Effective shift from the 'macro' (nation) to the 'micro' (individual home).",
        "Warm, inviting tone that avoids legalistic finger-pointing."

        "Be cautious of the 'paternalistic' assumption that the preacher knows exactly where the listener's 'home is collapsing'.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The appeal is the strongest side of this sermon. It moves from a 'Law' of missed opportunities and 'decayed corruption' to a 'Gospel' of the 'wild, glorious good news'. The ratio of Zuspruch (Promise) to Anspruch (Demand) is well-calibrated toward the end. The demand is not for moral self-improvement but for 'one affirmative nod'—a faith-response. However, the theological risk is that the 'Promise' is framed as a 'wondrous adventure' or 'high places of the Spirit', which can feel like a psychological 'peak experience' rather than the Barthian reality of being 'in Christ'. The appeal ear hears a call to trust, which is theologically sound, though it flirts with a 'ready-to-jump' emotionalism.",
      "quotes": [
        "One affirmative nod of your head, one firm yes in his direction.",
        "It is not too late, not yet, for your God waits.",
        "If thou hadst known... the things which belong unto thy peace."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The promise (God has not quit on you) successfully grounds the demand (say 'yes').",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Low. The focus is on 'visitation' and 'trust' rather than specific behavioral codes.",
      "strengths": [
        "The appeal is rooted in the presence of the Master ('The Master is here').",
        "Avoids the trap of 'Law-only' preaching."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Clarify that the 'yes' is a response to God's prior 'Yes' in Christ, to avoid making faith a human 'work'.",
        "Temper the 'high places of the Spirit' imagery with the reality of the Cross."

  "congruence_and_disruptions": {
    "congruence_judgment": "High congruence. The preacher's mournful tone matches the 'Green' self-revelation and the 'Red' appeal for a change of heart.",
    "dominant_side": "Red (Appeal) - The entire sermon builds toward the 'even now' moment of decision.",
    "disruptions": "The primary disruption is the 'Nationalistic Noise'—the sudden shift from Jerusalem to American natural resources creates a 'Blue' side friction that may distract from the 'Sache'.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a potent example of 'Pathos-driven Homiletics'. It successfully navigates the Four-Sides Model by aligning a sensitive 'Green' self-revelation with a compelling 'Red' appeal. The preacher uses the 'Yellow' relationship to create a sense of shared urgency. Theologically, it follows a Barthian 'Crisis' model—the moment of encounter where God 'visits' the human. However, it risks 'Psychologization' by equating the visitation of God with 'poignancy' and 'shivers' from literature. The 'Blue' side is the weakest, as the biblical text is used more for its atmospheric quality than its specific exegetical claims. The transition to American civil religion is a communicative risk that may alienate the 'Factual Ear' while stimulating the 'Relational Ear' of a specific demographic.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon risks pinning revelation to 'Erlebnis' (experience). God's visitation is described through the lens of human 'eyes really open' and 'listening ears', potentially making God's action dependent on human sensitivity.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Masterful use of emotional resonance and atmosphere.",
      "Clear, urgent movement from judgment to grace.",
      "Strong, poetic language that commands attention."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce reliance on secular aesthetic 'shivers' to validate the Holy Spirit.",
      "Strengthen the exegetical foundation of the 'Blue' side.",
      "Decouple the 'Visitation of God' from nationalistic prosperity."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively effective sermon that excels in 'Appeal' and 'Self-revelation', though it requires more 'Factual' and 'Theological' grounding to reach the highest level of homiletical integrity."
