At the very beginning we hear the proclamation that the light of the incarnate Word of God comes to shine in the darkness (1:5). Repeatedly in this gospel, Jesus teaches that he brings light to the world [...] Open, we pray thee, the eyes of our faith, that we may behold him in all his redeeming work; through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher treats three distinct texts as a thematic cluster rather than exhausting the 'nowhere else' quality of a single pericope. While the John 20 analysis is textual, it drifts into generalities about 'darkness' found elsewhere in John. The Job analysis is stronger on specificity regarding the 'whirlwind' response.",
      "quotes": [
        "The symbolism of night and darkness pervades the Gospel of John.",
        "The story about Thomas is placed by the evangelist John at the apex of his gospel story for a specific reason."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus on one pericope. Avoid using one text (Job) merely to illustrate a point about another (Thomas). Find the unique 'scandal' of the specific text that isn't a general Johannine theme."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "There is adequate attention to the 'burial customs of the Jews' and the literary structure of John. The use of a 'modern translator' for Job shows engagement with the Hebrew nuances of 'dust and ashes'. However, the theological weight remains on the surface.",
      "quotes": [
        "They bound the body tightly with the spices wrapped in linen bands, 'as is the burial custom of the Jews'",
        "One respected modern translator puts it this way: 'I will be quiet, comforted that I am dust.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the linguistic analysis. Why does John use 'darkness' specifically in 20:1 compared to 13:30? The exegesis is present but 'sleeps' too soundly."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest element. The preacher avoids 'general truths' by citing the specific tragedy in Piedmont, Alabama. This grounds the theological problem of doubt in a concrete, historical moment of 'misery'.",
      "quotes": [
        "In 1994, a church in Piedmont, Alabama, was destroyed by a tornado on Palm Sunday morning.",
        "You will come to know it in a hundred other ways, as the death of a friendship, the death of a career."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond psychological comfort to the 'zeitgeist'. How does the 'man-made god' mentioned relate to specific cultural idols of today?"
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a traditional 'block' structure: text explanation followed by a contemporary anecdote. The 'present of revelation' is hindered by this separation. The hearer is an observer of the text before being addressed by it.",
      "quotes": [
        "The kind of doubt that is on view today... is not trendy disaffection.",
        "In 1994, a church in Piedmont..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Integrate the Piedmont tragedy directly into the reading of Thomas’s demand, rather than placing it as a separate 'illustration' after the exegesis."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Misery is handled with necessary gravity ('cold clasp of death'). Redemption is external (the 'Who' not the 'Why'). Gratitude is less developed, appearing mostly as a formal liturgical conclusion.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is the night in which Sin and Death reign.",
        "God has entered our pain and been wounded by it... raised triumphant."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Develop the 'gratitude' (sanctification) aspect. How does the 'comfort of being dust' change the actual life/ethics of the believer on Monday morning?"

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher hints at the 'two ways' by contrasting the 'man-made god' with the 'God who is really God'. However, the 'seriousness of being lost' is softened into a choice between psychological projections and biblical reality, lacking the eternal weight Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "We have a real choice. We can choose a god who suits us... This god will have no nail prints.",
        "Those traditions will disappear... because they take neither man nor God seriously. (Dekker context)"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the consequence of choosing the 'domesticated household pet' god more sharply. What is the 'destruction' at the end of that broad way?"
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon correctly identifies that the resurrection is an act of God outside human possibility. The 'two natures' are implicit in the 'My Lord and my God' confession.",
      "quotes": [
        "The risen, living, reigning Christ says to us today...",
        "He arose from the kingdom of Death and carried away its spoils."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'Christ as God' aspect (Thesis 7) is not just a title but the ontological necessity for the 'Who' that answers Job."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "As a combined text, it has breadth. However, as individual sermons (if preached separately), they would likely fall under the 20-minute threshold. The depth is sufficient but occasionally relies on 'pious' language.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the 'Job' section to explore the 'nowhere else' quality of God's non-answer more deeply to reach the 20-minute mark of substantive 'breadth'."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon succeeds in its concrete application and Christocentric focus but falls short of Dekker's 'formal' requirement for a specific Bible passage by merging multiple Sundays into a thematic arc. The exegesis is adequate but lacks the sharp, 'recreative' power to make the text a 'new, current word' that stands alone from general Johannine themes.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application: The Piedmont tornado example avoids the 'general truth' trap.",
      "Theological gravity: The treatment of 'night' and 'death' as real powers, not just metaphors."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specificity: The sermon drifts into general 'Easter' themes rather than the unique scandal of the specific pericope.",
      "Structural separation: Exposition and application are treated as distinct phases rather than a mixed movement."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'strong' series of reflections, but it struggles to be a 'sermon' in Dekker's strict sense because it prioritizes a thematic synthesis over the rigorous, singular exposition of one specific passage. It is too 'thematic' and not 'proclamatory' enough in its specificity."
