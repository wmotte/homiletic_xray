    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon relies heavily on the 'found imagery' of the Isaianic text rather than original metaphors. However, the preacher effectively 'paints' the biblical scenes, particularly the satirical description of the idol-maker. By juxtaposing the 'stench' of the Babylonian culture with the cosmic imagery of God stretching the heavens, the preacher follows Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' by letting the biblical poetry do the heavy lifting. The imagery of the 'furnace of affliction' and the 'parched tongue' of the needy provides a sensory weight that grounds the theological abstraction of 'the living God'. The weakness lies in the anecdotal sections, which are more discursive than imagistic.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise, reflecting McEntyre’s 'stewardship of language'. The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by deconstructing it—specifically the critique of vague terms like 'spirituality' and 'religion'. The central grammatical metaphor ('God as the subject of the verb') is a masterclass in precision; it takes a technical linguistic concept and turns it into a profound theological diagnostic tool. The word choice is economical and deliberate, particularly in the distinction between God's 'intentional' and 'permissive' will. There is a clear 'loving care' for the weight of words, refusing to let 'God' become a subsidiary placeholder.",
      "quotes": [
        "The subject in so much of our preaching is ourselves — our faith, our ‘spirituality,’ our works, our journeys...",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The rhythm is somewhat uneven due to the 'teaching' nature of the text. The anecdotal sections have a conversational, staccato rhythm that works well for oral delivery. However, the middle section becomes a sequence of long scripture readings which, while beautiful, disrupts the preacher's own cadence. There is a lack of rhetorical parallelism or alliteration in the preacher's own prose, though the 'Subject of the Verb' acts as a rhythmic refrain. The ending regains musicality through a series of 'May he...' benedictions, creating a liturgical 'legato' that concludes the event with gravity.",
      "quotes": [
        "I have heard sermons from Maine to Florida, from Boston to Honolulu, from New Orleans to Minneapolis. No exaggeration.",
        "The question is not about love. The question is whether God is ‘living and active’.",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are defined by a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic. The preacher exercises high stewardship of language, particularly in the surgical critique of vague 'spirituality'. While the imagery is largely borrowed from the biblical text, it is curated with such precision that it feels fresh. The central metaphor of the 'Subject of the Verb' is a brilliant micro-aesthetic choice that anchors the entire linguistic structure. The musicality is functional rather than poetic, serving the clarity of the message rather than aesthetic delight, but it achieves a dignified gravity suitable for a clergy audience."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'problem-solution' arc, but it is more of a thematic journey than a narrative plot. It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium'—the shocking question 'Do you believe in God?'—which creates immediate tension. The movement progresses from a critique of the 'sidelined' church to the 'living God' of Isaiah. However, the middle section feels somewhat static, functioning as a commentary on various Isaianic themes rather than a driving narrative. The 'turning point' is the shift from human searching to divine action, but this is a conceptual turn rather than a dramatic one. The conclusion provides a strong resolution by returning to the opening question.",
      "quotes": [
        "“Do you believe in God?” I was not as shocked as you might think.",
        "Now the American church needs to be saved from itself again.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest structural strength. Cilliers' 'reframing' is fully operational here. The preacher takes the contemporary 'crisis of the mainline church' and reframes it through the lens of the Babylonian exile. The synthesis is not forced; the preacher finds an organic parallel between the 'idols of empire' in Babylon and the 'idols of self' in modern spirituality. The 'strangeness' of Isaiah is respected—the preacher doesn't domesticate the 'God who hides'—yet it is made urgently relevant to the political and ecclesiastical fragmentation of the post-Iraq war era. It offers a new frame: the church's problem isn't relevance, but its 'subject'.",
      "quotes": [
        "He is a member of a humiliated, exiled population, dwarfed by colossal images of imperial might...",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward a 'closed' structure. While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence and doubt' of the 'God who hides', the preacher’s tone is highly authoritative and prescriptive ('I speak with a certain amount of authority', 'I quite seriously propose'). The 'Subject of the Verb' framework is a powerful but somewhat monovalent interpretation—it doesn't leave much room for the hearer to interpret the 'silence' of God differently. The conclusion is a series of declarations rather than an invitation. However, the inclusion of the 'furnace of affliction' and the 'hidden God' prevents it from being a 'kitsch' happy ending, leaving a small crack for the mystery of suffering.",
      "quotes": [
        "Therefore, I speak with a certain amount of authority when I say...",

        "End with a question that forces the hearer to examine their own 'verbs' rather than a closed benediction.",
        "Allow more room for the 'resistance' of the hearer who feels God is indeed absent in suffering."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A relatively closed work of art; it is a 'witness' that demands a specific response rather than a 'poem' that invites exploration."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are characterized by a strong, confrontational arc that moves from the 'trouble' of a God-less church to the 'glory' of a God-centered reality. The integration of text and context is masterful, using the Babylonian exile to reframe the modern ecclesiastical crisis. However, the structure is somewhat rigid and authoritative, functioning more as a 'manifesto' or 'teaching' than an 'open work of art'. It succeeds in 'reframing' the hearer's perspective but offers little room for the hearer to navigate the space between the 'already' and 'not yet' on their own terms."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is the antithesis of religious kitsch. It explicitly attacks the 'kitsch' of modern spirituality—the 'inspirational stories' and 'techniques of meditation' that offer immediate comfort without God. By insisting on the 'God who hides' and the 'furnace of affliction', the preacher refuses the 'happy ending' cliché. The emotion is authentic because it is rooted in the 'humiliation' of exile and the 'parched thirst' of the needy. There is no sentimentality here; even the 'loving God' is subordinated to the 'living God', which is a much more dangerous and less 'cozy' concept.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The preacher's critique of the 'stewardship sermon with inspirational stories but no God' is a direct identification of kitsch.",
      "The critique of 'spirituality' as a technique rather than an encounter."

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens a 'Space for Grace' by removing the burden from the human subject. By shifting the 'Subject of the Verb' from 'us' to 'God', it creates a space where grace is possible because it is no longer dependent on human 'spirituality' or 'journeys'. However, the space is slightly constricted by the preacher's authoritative tone, which can feel 'dogmatically sealed'. The 'mystery' is respected through the concept of the 'hidden God', but the sermon's insistence on a 'sovereign Lord who shakes foundations' leaves little room for the 'still small voice'. It is a space for a *mighty* grace, perhaps more than a *tender* one.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between God's sovereignty and human suffering are sustained through the 'hidden God' motif.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, particularly in the refusal to explain why the 'poor and needy' still die wretched deaths.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails over moralization; the sermon is a call to 'witness' rather than a list of 'to-dos'.",
    "recommendation": "To open more space, allow the 'vulnerability' of the preacher to match the 'vulnerability' of the exiled people."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'Sober-Reformed' homiletics. Its beauty lies not in baroque ornamentation but in the 'beauty of simplicity' and the 'power of metaphor'. The central aesthetic move is the grammatical 'reframing' of the divine-human relationship. By focusing on 'The Subject of the Verb', the preacher performs a linguistic 'iconoclasm', smashing the idols of self-centered spirituality. The sermon's imagery is deeply biblical, and its structure—while slightly rigid—effectively carries the weight of a 'witness' rather than a mere 'teacher'. It avoids the 'kitsch' of modern religious sentimentality by dwelling in the 'furnace of affliction' and the 'hiddenness' of God. While it lacks the 'polyphony' of an open work of art, it possesses a 'monumental' quality that is aesthetically consistent with the Isaianic text it proclaims.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "The 'Subject of the Verb' as a transformative theological and linguistic metaphor.",
      "Rigorous anti-kitsch stance that honors the reality of suffering and the hiddenness of God.",

      "Softening the authoritative 'I' to allow for more 'openness' and hearer participation.",

    "audience_analysis": "Ordained clergy and theological students who are weary of 'therapeutic' preaching and crave 'substance' and 'sovereignty'.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'showing' the 'living God' through a contemporary narrative that doesn't resolve into a happy ending.",
      "Use more 'staccato' sentence structures during the theological 'teaching' moments to increase oral energy.",
      "Try ending with a 'poetic image' rather than a 'dogmatic declaration' to increase the 'openness' of the work."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This is a high-quality homiletical event that succeeds through its 'stewardship of language' and its refusal to bow to the 'idols' of modern sentimentality. It achieves a 'Space for Grace' by the radical act of displacing the human ego from the center of the sermon. While it borders on the 'academic-declarative' at times, its deep roots in the poetic soil of Isaiah give it an aesthetic gravity that is rare in contemporary preaching. It is a 'witness' that is both aesthetically honest and theologically sharp."
