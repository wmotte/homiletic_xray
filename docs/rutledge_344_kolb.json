    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a liturgical 'hook' by addressing the congregation as the 'heart's core.' However, it lacks a specific, vivid narrative or modern-day 'slice of life' to ground the experience. The experience is primarily mediated through the liturgical setting and the act of singing hymns rather than through concrete human situations. The identification with characters is limited to a collective 'we' in the context of the crucifixion.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This phase is well-developed through the exploration of the 'problem' of sin and the human condition. The preacher pauses to analyze the concept of 'the Jews' in John, offering a cultural and historical critique that prevents a superficial reading. There is a clear attempt to explore the 'why' of the human predicament—specifically the 'prison house of sin'—and the limitations of self-betterment.",

      "analysis": "This is the strongest phase of the sermon. The preacher provides a thorough theological exposition of Johannine themes: the Lamb of God, the 'Hour,' and the 'Glorification.' The exegesis is solid, drawing connections between John, Paul, and the Psalms. The 'big idea'—that Christ's death is a victory (Christus Victor) rather than a mere tragedy—is logically developed and formulated through the concept of 'consummation.'",

However, it falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase, offering few concrete handles for the congregation to apply these truths to their daily ethical lives. The 'Concrete Experience' is largely confined to the liturgical setting, missing opportunities for more vivid, relatable storytelling. It is a 'Declarative' sermon that serves the 'Assimilating' learner well but may leave the 'Converging' and 'Accommodating' learners wanting more practical engagement.",

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong example of a traditional, high-church meditation that prioritizes theological accuracy and liturgical resonance. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon that provides excellent intellectual and reflective content but lacks the practical 'feet' necessary for a complete experiential learning cycle. It is highly effective for a congregation that values doctrinal depth and liturgical beauty, but it requires more concrete application to be truly holistic. The priority for improvement is the development of the Pragmatic quadrant to ensure that the 'victory of the cross' translates into the 'victory of daily life.'"
