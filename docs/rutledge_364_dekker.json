    "sermon_start_end": "The esteemed short-story writer Joy Williams wrote a book of short—and I mean really short—stories called Ninety-nine Stories of God. This one is my favorite: The Lord was drinking some water out of a glass. There was nothing wrong with the glass, but the water tasted terrible. [...] In the age to come, in the city of God that will come down from heaven, there is a river of unquenchable love, bought for us by the agony and thirst of the only-begotten Son of God. Come to his water. Come to his cross. Come to his blood, shed for you... and find for yourselves the gift of the love that will never fail."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails to isolate what is unique to John 19:28-29. Instead of focusing on the specific 'I thirst' and the hyssop/vinegar, it immediately pivots to a literary anecdote and then to John 4 (Samaritan woman) and Revelation 22. The specificity of the text is lost in a general thematic exploration of 'water'.",
      "quotes": [
        "In order to grasp the point here, we need to know a passage from the Gospel of John [Chapter 4].",
        "It is the remarkable imagination of Joy Williams that permits us to see the intricate connection..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus exclusively on why Jesus says 'I thirst' in the context of the 'accomplishment' (v. 28). What does this specific physical cry say about God that the rest of the Bible does not?"
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is some awareness of the Johannine context (the 'hour', the 'lifting up'), but the exegesis is secondary to literary illustration. The mention of the Torah and Psalms shows some effort, but it feels like a survey of cross-references rather than a deep dive into the Greek text or the specific theological weight of the hyssop in John's passion narrative.",
      "quotes": [
        "the Fourth Evangelist tells us...",
        "John is quoting Psalm 34:20",
        "John quotes Zechariah 12:10"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond cross-referencing. Analyze the specific Greek term for 'accomplished' (tetelestai) and the significance of 'hyssop' in the Passover context of John's Gospel."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding environmental issues (Flint, Michigan) and social outcasts (migrants). However, it risks becoming a general ethical lecture on 'carelessness and greed' rather than a specific application of the Word of God to the spiritual state of the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "We might think of the city government in Flint, Michigan...",
        "to die of thirst like a nameless migrant expiring alone in the desert along the border"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the contemporary 'thirst' not just to social disasters, but to the specific spiritual 'misery' of the congregation as they stand before the cross."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon oscillates between literary analysis, biblical history, and social commentary. While not a strict 'block' structure, the transitions are driven by the 'water' metaphor rather than the text itself drawing the hearer into the revelation.",
      "quotes": [
        "The interplay here between symbolism and factual reality is endlessly rich."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Stop treating the text as a 'metaphor' or 'symbol' and let the text 'expound' the hearer directly. Avoid the distance created by 'I wonder what brought you off the streets'."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Misery is present in the description of thirst and social injustice. Redemption is linked to the cross. However, the 'gratitude' (the life of the Spirit) is somewhat vague, described as 'unquenchable love' without concrete ethical direction for the believer's life.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus comes alongside the least and the lost of humanity.",
        "the lifegiving blood of the Lamb, is the metaphor for the eternal life"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Clarify the 'gratitude' part. How does the 'living water' specifically transform the hearer's daily walk beyond feeling 'love'?"
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on the 'race that seems more than ever to be bent on destroying itself', which hints at collective loss. However, the individual responsibility and the eternal 'two ways' are softened into a general hope for the 'age to come'. The seriousness of being 'lost' is largely externalized to social victims.",
      "quotes": [
        "our race that seems more than ever to be bent on destroying itself and its beautiful planet."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the hearer's own possibility of being 'lost'—not just the planet's destruction, but the individual's relation to the 'narrow way' of the cross."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is strongly Christocentric. It correctly identifies Christ as the Source and the telos. The emphasis on the 'two natures' (fully human thirst/fully divine source) aligns with Dekker’s requirements for substantive preaching.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus the Son of God is the Source of the river of the water of life.",
        "the only-begotten Son of God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure Christ is not just a 'metaphor' for love, but the actual, living Lord who demands a response here and now."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1,350 words, the sermon would last roughly 13-14 minutes. This is significantly below Dekker's 20-minute minimum. The 'breadth' required for 'depth' is missing; the sermon relies on quick literary pivots rather than sustained theological labor.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical and dogmatic sections. The sermon ends just as it begins to touch on the actual theological weight of the passion."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily due to its brevity and its reliance on the Bible as a source of 'metaphor' rather than a specific, current Word of God. It treats the text as a thematic jumping-off point for a meditation on water, rather than an exposition of the unique content of John 19. The length (approx. 14 minutes) precludes the 'breadth' Dekker demands for true depth.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christological focus on the two natures of Christ (human weakness vs. divine source).",
      "Concrete contemporary references (Flint, migrants) avoid the trap of 'general truths'."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length to achieve theological depth.",
      "Lack of focus on the specific Bible passage; too much 'thematic' wandering to other books.",
      "Over-reliance on literary anecdotes (Joy Williams) which distances the hearer from the authority of the Word."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an 'adequate' speech (Score: 5/10), but it is not yet a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense. It lacks the necessary breadth of time and the rigorous specificity of the chosen pericope."
