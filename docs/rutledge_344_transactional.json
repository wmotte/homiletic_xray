    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "While theologically rich in the tradition of substitutionary atonement, the sermon is psychologically regressive. it relies heavily on inducing a 'Child' state of guilt and helplessness to make the 'Parental' solution attractive. By using 'we' and 'us' language, the preacher attempts to soften the blow, but the underlying dynamic is one of NIGYSOB ('Now I've Got You...')—identifying the listener as the crucifier to justify the need for the sermon's specific brand of rescue.",

      "Over-reliance on the 'Slave/Prison' metaphor which strips the listener of Adult agency.",
      "The 'Us vs. Them' (Church vs. Scholars/Media) creates a defensive Adapted Child atmosphere."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as 'Adults' who can choose to follow Christ out of inspiration (Free Child) rather than just out of a need to escape a 'prison' of their own making. Reduce the use of 'must' and 'intolerable burden' to allow for a more authentic, less coerced response."
