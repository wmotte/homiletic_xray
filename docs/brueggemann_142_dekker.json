    "sermon_start_end": "I have selected as our text the Acts reading for next Sunday in the lectionary, the Third Sunday of Easter. I discovered, however, that one cannot take that moment in the lectionary alone, for the narrative has a much bigger sweep than that. Likely you know of the phrase [...] The Book of Acts is a summons to the church with its daring political engagement, its bodily trust, and its capacity for transformation. It is a time for dancing and leaping and praising God. It is a time for refreshing. No wonder the authorities were much annoyed. Ecce homo!"

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon focuses on the narrative arc of Acts 3-4. It correctly identifies a recurring linguistic pattern ('this man') that is specific to this text. However, it tends to drift into general 'Easter themes' and 'empire' concepts that could be applied to many other texts.",
      "quotes": [
        "The text returns to him over and over. Thus: A man lame from birth... this man... the man.",
        "What is in this Bible passage that you can find NOWHERE else in the Bible?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more exclusively on the unique tension between the 'Beautiful Gate' and the 'lame man' as a specific theological locus rather than a general metaphor for political resistance."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The exegesis is limited. While it identifies the 'Ecce Homo' connection, it admits to offering 'no exegesis' on key phrases like 'sins wiped out'. The historical context of the Temple and Roman-Jewish relations is treated more as a modern political foil than a rigorous historical-theological study.",
      "quotes": [
        "The language is stereotypical: get your sins wiped out. No exegesis offered on that phrase.",
        "By what authority, surely not the authority of Rome, did you revise social relationships?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Utilize the required knowledge of Greek and the religious history of Israel to explain the significance of the 'Beautiful Gate' and the specific cultic exclusion of the lame."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is heavily focused on 'empire' and 'military capitalism'. While concrete in its political stance, it risks becoming a 'general truth' of a specific ideology. It lacks the broad humanities-based spiritual application Dekker seeks, focusing almost exclusively on socio-political structures.",
      "quotes": [
        "the empire of military capitalism in which we live",
        "erosion of public schools in the drive of privatization, the militarization of the police"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Broaden the application to include the individual's spiritual life, gratitude, and the 'zeitgeist' beyond just political critique."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon succeeds well in mixing exposition and application. The movement between the biblical 'man' and the contemporary 'empire' is fluid, drawing the hearer into the text's movement.",
      "quotes": [
        "The man noticed in the narrative is not Jesus... It is this man that the church puts on exhibit, a verification of our Easter faith.",
        "We play all these roles: The fearful authorities, The astonished crowd..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'interweaving' doesn't lead to the text being swallowed by the application."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Misery is present (the lameness/stagnation), and gratitude is present (dancing/leaping). However, the 'redemption' is heavily horizontal (social transformation) rather than the vertical 'redemption through Christ' as the primary subject.",
      "quotes": [
        "He is among those who are not left in their disability, but are immediately transformed",
        "It is a time for dancing and leaping and praising God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Strengthen the 'misery' as misery before God, not just misery under 'empire'."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on 'stagnation' vs 'refreshing'. It presents a choice, but the 'lostness' is purely temporal/political. The 'eternal loss' mentioned by Dekker is absent, making the stakes feel more like social activism than ultimate destination.",
      "quotes": [
        "Those addressed by Peter were invited to decide, to opt for the time of refreshment, to vote with their lives against the despair of old deathly patterns."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the seriousness of being 'lost' in a way that takes both God and the individual's eternal responsibility seriously."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the 'Author of life', but the sermon explicitly states that the 'man' is the focus, not Jesus. Dekker insists Christ is the 'telos'. Here, Christ seems to be the 'power source' for a human-centric social change.",
      "quotes": [
        "The man noticed in the narrative is not Jesus... It is this man that the church puts on exhibit",
        "this holy transformation is not performed by Jesus. It is performed by the church"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Re-establish Christ as the telos (goal) of the sermon, ensuring he is not 'silenced' by the focus on the healed man or the church's agency."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1450 words, the sermon would take about 14-15 minutes. This falls short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum for 'depth'.",
      "quotes": [
        "A sermon that lasts less than 20 minutes cannot be a sermon."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical depth and the breadth of application to reach the required 20-minute threshold."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily in its length, its lack of rigorous exegesis, and its tendency to replace the 'One Lord' with the 'healed man' as the primary subject. While it successfully avoids 'general truths' by focusing on the narrative of Acts 3-4, it replaces them with a narrow political hermeneutic of 'empire' that risks becoming its own kind of generalism.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective linguistic focus on the recurring 'man' in the text.",
      "Strong interwoven structure that avoids a dry split between theory and practice.",
      "Avoids 'soft' preaching by demanding a concrete response/repentance."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (14 minutes) to achieve the 'breadth' Dekker requires.",
      "Explicit avoidance of exegesis on key theological terms like 'sin'.",
      "Horizontalized 'redemption' that prioritizes social change over the work of Christ as God."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a vigorous speech with strong rhetorical qualities, but according to Dekker's strict formal and substantive definitions, it is not yet a 'sermon'. It lacks the necessary length for depth and the Christocentric telos required for the right proclamation of the Gospel."
