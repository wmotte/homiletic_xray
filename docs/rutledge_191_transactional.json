    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "While the sermon is rhetorically beautiful and theologically traditional, it relies heavily on a Parent-Child dynamic that requires the listener to adopt a 'Sick/Miserable' identity to receive 'Grace.' This creates a psychological paradox: the love is described as 'unconditional,' yet the sermon spends significant time conditioning its reception on a specific form of self-abasement. The emphasis on 'no health in us' can be psychologically regressive, discouraging Adult agency.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on the 'Miserable Offender' trope which can trigger shame-based responses.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult invitation for the listener to find health and agency."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as 'Adults' who have the capacity for both sin and goodness simultaneously. Instead of 'there is no health in us,' explore how the 'Adult' can partner with the Divine to foster existing health. Avoid the 'Bait and Switch' of offering unconditional love and then immediately demanding a 'miserable' self-assessment."
