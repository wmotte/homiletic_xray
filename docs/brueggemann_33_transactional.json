    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and remarkably free of manipulative 'games.' It utilizes an Adult-Adult transaction to deconstruct the Critical Parent structures (orthodoxy, scientific certitude, social control) that keep individuals in an Adapted Child state. By championing the 'Free Child' (the blind man's innocence and joy) and the 'Adult' (the man's refusal to ignore reality), the preacher promotes autonomy and self-awareness. The preacher’s willingness to include himself in the 'conflict' prevents the sermon from becoming a Persecutor-Victim dynamic.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The concluding 'Thanks be to God' is a standard liturgical script that briefly shifts back to a Parent-Child ritual, though it is not harmful.",
      "Could further explore the 'Adult' implications of 'seeing' in a practical, daily context."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'we' instead of 'you' to maintain the horizontal Adult-Adult transaction. Keep the focus on 'invitation' rather than 'obligation.'"
