    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and promotes high levels of autonomy. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent by identifying 'judgment' and 'control' as the very things God's life overcomes. By using an Adult-Adult transaction, Brueggemann invites the listener into a state of 'speechless amazement' (Free Child) rather than 'fearful compliance' (Adapted Child). It successfully navigates the tension between a 'hard word' (shattering of control) and a 'good word' (new possibility) without resorting to manipulation or guilt-based payoffs.",

      "Deconstruction of religious games (Sadducees' trap).",

      "Vivid language that engages the Free Child ego state."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The intellectual density may occasionally risk leaving the 'Child' ego state behind in favor of pure 'Adult' processing.",
      "The transition from the 'scientific community' to 'sea monsters' is a large leap for the Adult ego to process."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name the 'games' (like the 'numbers game' or 'Bible quoting') as they appear in the text; this transparency prevents the preacher from inadvertently starting a new game with the congregation."
