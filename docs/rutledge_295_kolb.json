    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is highly effective in establishing concrete experience. It avoids abstract 'modern man' tropes and instead uses specific, sensory-rich narratives. The preacher's personal story of driving into New York City on a gloomy Easter morning provides a recognizable emotional landscape of isolation and 'bummed' feelings. This allows the hearer to feel the contrast between the 'ironbound shops' and the 'dazzlingly silhouetted' usher, mirroring the movement from doubt to faith.",
      "quotes": [
        "I got up by myself, dressed by myself, drank my Carnation Instant Breakfast by myself, and drove into the city by myself.",
        "The blocks immediately north of Grace Church, consisting as they do of rows and rows of antique stores locked and bolted with iron gates pulled down over their fronts like mausoleums."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition from the personal story to Thomas's experience is smooth, but could be strengthened by more explicitly linking the preacher's 'need for a sign' (the usher) to Thomas's demand for physical proof.",
        "The initial newsmagazine hook is slightly disconnected from the deeper emotional narrative that follows."
      ],
      "homiletical_manifestations": "Manifests through a lengthy, detailed personal narrative (the New York Easter) and the use of contemporary cultural artifacts (newsmagazines)."
    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon facilitates reflection by analyzing Thomas's character as a 'congenital pessimist' and a believer in 'Murphy’s law.' It explores the 'why' of human doubt, suggesting that we often create conditions for faith that we believe will never be met. However, the reflection remains largely character-focused rather than exploring broader cultural or systemic reasons for modern skepticism, which limits its depth in this phase.",
      "quotes": [
        "Thomas was a believer in Murphy’s law, so to speak. He sensed that Jesus was going to die and that they would be left without any future.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The theological exposition is clear and grounded in the text. The preacher identifies the 'big idea'—that faith is personal trust in a living Lord rather than intellectual assent to data. The exegesis of the 'highest titles' given to Jesus (My Lord and my God) provides a solid dogmatic foundation, linking the end of the Gospel back to its Prologue.",
      "quotes": [
        "Where previously his idea of faith was intellectual assent to a set of observable facts, now it becomes personal trust in a living Lord.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the sermon ends with a powerful visionary call, it lacks specific, concrete action steps. The 'application' is primarily internal/dispositional (yielding in trust) rather than external/ethical. The hearer is told *what* to be (a believer) but is given few handles on *how* to live out this 'bond of trust' in the coming week.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of narrative-driven preaching that successfully bridges the gap between contemporary experience and biblical text. It falls short primarily in the pragmatic application (Active Experimentation), opting for a visionary call to trust rather than concrete ethical or practical steps. The preacher's use of personal vulnerability and sensory detail creates a high level of engagement for 'Accommodating' and 'Diverging' learners. The theological work is solid, providing a clear 'Big Idea' regarding the nature of faith as personal trust. However, the 'Converging' learner seeking practical handles will find the conclusion somewhat ethereal.",

    "conclusion": "This is a well-crafted sermon that excels in the 'feeling' and 'thinking' quadrants of Kolb's cycle but lacks the 'doing.' It is highly effective at creating an emotional and theological 'aha' moment through narrative, but it leaves the transformation in the realm of the internal and visionary. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 3/4 cycle sermon. It is a strong model for how to use personal story without being self-indulgent, but it requires more pragmatic grounding to be truly holistic."
