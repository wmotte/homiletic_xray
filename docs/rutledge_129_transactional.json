    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in Easter rhetoric. It avoids the 'Bait & Switch' of using grace to demand legalistic compliance. Instead, it uses the Adult ego state to process the reality of powerlessness (Kosovo, sickness, death) and the Nurturing Parent to offer a theological 'way out.' The preacher’s willingness to share her own failures (and her husband's) humanizes the pulpit, preventing a Critical Parent dynamic.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of Adult reality-testing regarding global events.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The critique of 'largely white congregations' could border on Critical Parent if not handled with the humor she used.",
      "The 'The Lord is able' anecdote could be misinterpreted by a 'Child' ego as a promise of physical healing every time."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to validate the 'Adult' reality of the listeners' suffering before offering the 'Parent' comfort. This prevents the comfort from feeling like 'smothering' or denial."
