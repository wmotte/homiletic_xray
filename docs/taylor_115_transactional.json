  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and avoids the manipulative traps common in homiletics. It functions primarily through the Nurturing Parent and Free Child ego states. The preacher uses high-status imagery to provide a 'holding environment' for the congregation's grief. While there is a slight risk of making the listeners feel 'lesser' through the extreme exaltation of Proctor, the preacher mitigates this by stating that faithfulness is accessible to all. The ending is a masterclass in Free Child imagination, transforming the fear of death into a joyful 'arrival gate' at an airport.",

      "Could include more 'Adult' ego state reflection on the practical legacy of the deceased.",
      "The 'rough gingham' metaphor risks reinforcing a 'Not-OK' position for the listener."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Free Child' to create imaginative hope, but ensure that the 'Adult' ego state is invited to consider how to practically emulate the virtues being praised."
