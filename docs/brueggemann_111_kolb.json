    "sermon_start_end": "For a very long and well-established time, there has been a marvelous congruity between the values of our faith and the values of our society. More than anywhere else since Calvin’s Geneva, we Presbyterian types in America have been able to affirm a convergence between faith and public practice [...] The answer sends us to public issues as the place where Jesus will be obeyed, not in private acts, but in matters of policy. The kingdom coming is not a private party. It is a new public way in the world.",
    "notes": "The sermon is a social-prophetic address delivered in a North American context, likely around the mid-1980s given the reference to the Catholic Bishops' letters."

  "kolb_phases_analysis": {
    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a socio-historical observation rather than a 'slice of life' or an immediate emotional hook. While it references the 'American Christian' experience, it remains somewhat conceptual. The 'feeling' level is addressed through the lens of 'crisis' and 'fear,' but the sermon lacks a vivid, singular narrative that allows the hearer to inhabit a specific moment. The imagery of the 'shepherd' is the primary concrete anchor, yet it is treated more as a metaphor for governance than a sensory experience.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now that congruity and that convergence are coming apart.",

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the strongest phase of the sermon. The preacher excels at pausing to analyze the 'why' behind the human and societal condition. He moves beyond superficial politics to explore the underlying psychological and spiritual patterns—specifically the role of fear and vested interest in shaping public policy. He invites the congregation to look in the 'mirror' of the text to see their own lack of awareness regarding the marginal.",
      "quotes": [
        "The alternative to facing the crisis is that we should dig into our favorite position... and then later discover that we have not been thinking about obedience to Jesus but we have been thinking only about our vested interest.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a clear theological framework based on the sovereignty of God and the biblical definition of justice. The exegesis of Ezekiel 34 is solid, explaining the 'shepherd' as a political 'king' and God's 'I' as a sovereign decree. The 'Big Idea' is the shift from private spirituality to public justice. However, the connection between the Old Testament 'David' and the New Testament 'Jesus' is made quickly and could benefit from more systematic theological development.",

        "The Bible has a clear and odd notion of justice. It does not mean that one gets what one deserves. Rather it means that one gets what one needs in order to live.",

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is weakest in providing concrete action steps. While it calls for a 'new public way' and 'feeding the sheep,' these remain largely metaphorical or general. The preacher explicitly states his aim is 'modest' and 'not to persuade,' which results in a lack of specific ethical calls. The hearer is left with 'questions to think about' rather than a 'how-to' for the coming week.",

It excels at diagnosing the cultural and spiritual condition of the hearer, using the biblical text as a mirror to expose the underlying fears that drive public policy. The theological redefinition of justice is clear and challenging. However, the sermon falls short of completing the Kolb cycle because it intentionally avoids specific application. While this respects the hearer's autonomy, it risks leaving the 'converging' and 'accommodating' learners without a path forward. The movement is primarily from cultural observation to theological abstraction, with the 'active experimentation' phase being replaced by a call to 'rethink.'",

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a sophisticated theological reflection that successfully challenges the hearer's worldview. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon—excellent in reflection and conceptualization, but deficient in concrete experience and active experimentation. It serves the 'Assimilating' learner well but may leave the rest of the congregation in a state of 'reflective paralysis.' The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'decree from the throne' and the 'matters of policy' with specific, actionable steps that embody the justice described."
