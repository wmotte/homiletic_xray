    "summary": "While theologically consistent with a specific reading of Pauline depravity, the sermon is psychologically coercive. It utilizes 'Formula G' by explicitly framing the liturgy as a 'trap' or 'set-up.' By dismantling the listener's 'Adult' reality-testing regarding their own relative innocence (e.g., being a bystander vs. a murderer), it forces an 'Adapted Child' response of shame. The preacher positions himself as the one who knows the 'truth' about the listeners' hearts better than they do, which is a hallmark of the Critical Parent.",
