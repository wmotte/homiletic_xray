    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes strong, sensory imagery to bridge the gap between physical and spiritual hunger. The preacher effectively employs the metaphor of 'junk food' and 'junk diets' to describe secular pursuits like success and drugs. There is a vivid 'painting' of the biblical search for titles, described as 'scurrying around' and 'tracking to its lair.' However, the imagery is occasionally more rhetorical than sensory, relying on evocative adjectives rather than fully developed cinematic scenes. The 'show, don't tell' principle is applied well in the description of Cardinal Wolsey and the 'river at spate,' but some theological sections remain abstract. The strength lies in the juxtaposition of the 'splendor' of Christ with the 'sleaze' of contemporary culture.",
      "quotes": [
        "Junk food, sex — I do not demean it, but to use it as our diet is at last to be betrayed.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and demonstrates high 'stewardship of language.' The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by explaining theological terms like 'theophany' with a self-deprecating wit. There is a sophisticated vocabulary (e.g., 'superfluities,' 'inchoate,' 'servility') that is used with surgical precision to diagnose the human condition. The preacher treats words as instruments of truth, particularly in the correction of John Winthrop’s 'city on a hill' quote. This demonstrates a high ethical regard for the integrity of the word. The nuance in distinguishing between 'very God of very God' as a necessary redundancy shows deep theological and linguistic care.",
      "quotes": [

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 9,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. The text exhibits a rhythmic cadence typical of the best oral traditions. The use of triads ('hands and their hearts and minds'), alliteration ('foibles and failures,' 'pomp and circumstance'), and parallelism creates a 'legato' flow that mirrors the 'river at spate' mentioned in the text. The sentence lengths vary masterfully, moving from short, punchy declarations to long, flowing rhetorical periods. The preacher uses sound value to emphasize meaning, such as the 'grunts and groans' of human language versus the 'magnificent cadences' of the gospel. It is clearly 'ear language,' not 'paper language.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Another flicker of the eye, another breath inhaled, exhaled, one heartbeat closer to the last.",

    "average_score_language": 8.0,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are of a very high caliber. The preacher demonstrates a rare command of the English language, blending high-academic vocabulary with the rhythmic vitality of the African American pulpit. The imagery is consistent and culturally relevant, though the musicality of the prose is the standout feature. The language is used not just to inform, but to evoke a sense of the 'unutterable' through carefully crafted cadences. It avoids the dryness of a lecture while maintaining the precision of a scholar."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a thematic movement rather than a strict narrative plot. It begins with a lengthy, humorous anecdote that establishes rapport but delays the 'upsetting of the equilibrium.' Once the text is introduced, the movement is from the 'hunger' of the human condition to the 'Bread' of Christ. The tension is built through a critique of modern 'junk diets' (drugs, greed), leading to a turning point where the 'I AM' of Christ provides meaning. However, the structure feels somewhat episodic—moving from drug forums to TV shows to church history—rather than a single, driving arc. The energy is sustained by the preacher's voice rather than a tight 'homiletical plot.'",
      "quotes": [
        "I want today to deal with this passage...",
        "This raises a question about why people take drugs.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels at 'reframing' (Cilliers). It takes the ancient 'I AM' and the 'Bread of Life' and places them directly into the context of 1980s America—specifically the drug crisis and the 'greed is good' culture of *Dallas* and *Dynasty*. The preacher does not just apply the text; he uses the text to unmask the 'iniquity' of the context. The synthesis is organic: the physical hunger for drugs is reframed as a spiritual hunger for meaning. The 'strangeness' of the 'I AM' is respected as a divine claim that challenges human 'servility before secular power.'",
      "quotes": [
        "What is, to use his phrase, 'the gap in our sense of meaning'?",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon is largely an 'open work of art' (Stark). While it is rhetorically forceful, it leaves space for the hearer to reflect on their own 'junk diets.' The preacher acknowledges the 'unutterable' nature of the gospel and the 'failure' of human language, which invites the hearer into the mystery rather than providing a closed system of dogmatic facts. However, the ending is quite declarative and 'closed' with a traditional assurance of 'eternal health.' While comforting, it resolves the tension of the 'hunger' quite quickly. The middle sections, dealing with failure and meaning, offer the most 'open' space for the hearer's own struggle.",
      "quotes": [
        "We're dealing with a wonder for which words were never made.",

    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is characterized by a powerful thematic movement that effectively bridges the biblical world and the contemporary social landscape. While the narrative arc is somewhat episodic and the introduction is long, the 'reframing' of modern crises through the lens of Christ's 'I AM' is masterfully executed. The sermon sustains tension between the 'already' of Christ's provision and the 'not yet' of human struggle, though it leans toward a closed, traditional resolution in its final moments."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids religious kitsch. It does not offer 'cheap comfort' or 'pre-chewed emotions.' Instead, it confronts the 'anguished soul' and the 'penitential tears' of failure. The preacher's critique of 'health-and-wealth' preachers is a direct attack on religious kitsch (the 'happy ending' gospel). The emotion feels authentic because it is rooted in the 'foibles and failures' of the human condition. There is a 'sober beauty' in the admission that human language is but 'grunts and groans' before the mystery of God.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The opening anecdote, while charming, flirts with the 'polished speaker' persona that can lead to kitsch.",
      "The final sentence 'our eternal health is certain' is a borderline cliché, though earned by the preceding struggle."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of Arthur Gossip's 'penitential tears' on the pulpit stairs.",
      "The honest admission that 'we will never be what we meant to be in terms of humanity'."

    "recommendation": "Maintain the focus on the 'unutterable' and the 'failure' of language to prevent the sermon from becoming a 'performance' of piety."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully opens a 'space for grace' by first establishing the depth of human 'hunger' and 'failure.' By deconstructing the 'junk diets' of success and greed, the preacher creates a vacuum that only grace can fill. The 'I AM' is presented not as a demand, but as a 'strength for living' that is 'subtly gracious.' The preacher sustains the tension of being 'maimed by nature' while simultaneously being 'children of God.' It avoids moralism by emphasizing that the 'Bread' is a gift to be fed upon, not a law to be followed.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between human insufficiency and divine sufficiency is the core of the sermon.",
    "mystery_respected": "Highly respected; the preacher explicitly states that the gospel is a 'wonder for which words were never made.'",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; even the social critique is framed as a loss of 'meaning' and 'grace' rather than a list of rules.",
    "recommendation": "Continue to emphasize the 'unavailable' nature of God's presence to ensure the 'Bread' doesn't become a commodity."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a high-quality example of aesthetic homiletics, blending rhetorical musicality with profound cultural reframing. Its primary strength lies in its 'Poetics of Language'—the rhythm and cadence of the prose are exceptional, creating an oral event that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant. The preacher avoids the 'kitsch' of easy answers by dwelling honestly on human failure and the limitations of language. While the structure is somewhat episodic and the introduction is lengthy, the integration of text and context is seamless. The sermon successfully 'reframes' the social ills of the 1980s (drugs, greed) as symptoms of a deeper spiritual hunger, thereby opening a 'space for grace' that feels both urgent and timeless. It is a 'sober-reformed' aesthetic that uses the power of the word to point toward the mystery of the Word made flesh.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional rhythmic musicality and oral cadence.",
      "Profound 'reframing' of contemporary social crises through the 'I AM' claim.",

      "Tighten the disproportionately long introductory anecdote.",
      "Create a more cohesive narrative arc to link the episodic contemporary critiques.",

    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Trouble and Grace).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to those who value intellectual depth, rhetorical beauty, and a social conscience rooted in biblical tradition.",

      "Experiment with a more 'cinematic' scene-setting for the biblical text.",
      "Try an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer with a lingering question.",
      "Reduce the 'preamble' to enter the 'tension' of the text more quickly."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust performance that honors the 'stewardship of language.' It demonstrates that 'how' a message is delivered (with rhythm, precision, and honesty) is inseparable from 'what' is delivered (the grace of the Bread of Life). It stands as a strong example of how to engage culture without succumbing to kitsch, maintaining a 'sober beauty' that is transparent toward the divine."
