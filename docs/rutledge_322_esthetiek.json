    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in 'showing' rather than 'telling' by utilizing concrete, sensory vignettes. The preacher moves from the mundane (Chinese laundry bunnies) to the horrific (a modern painting of a naked, tortured Christ). This imagery serves the 'aesthetic turn' by making the theological concept of the 'Power of Darkness' visible and visceral. The use of the nuclear reactor as a metaphor for human capacity for destruction provides a stark, modern image that reframes the ancient crucifixion. However, some metaphors regarding 'secular stories' remain slightly more conceptual than sensory.",
      "quotes": [
        "The place was bedecked from stem to stern with bunnies, eggs, and best wishes for a happy Easter.",
        "For one thing, the Lord has no loincloth, as he certainly would not have had in real life.",
        "When you stand in front of the reactor, you realize this is what humans can do."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of 'visual' aids through verbal description (the book of paintings).",
        "Strong contrast between 'kitsch' imagery (bunnies) and 'authentic' imagery (the unsparing crucifixion).",
        "Concrete cultural markers (Polo clothes, Range Rover) anchor the sermon in reality."

        "The 'heavenly Jerusalem' could be more vividly painted to match the grit of the earthly one.",
        "The 'banquet table' at the end is a standard metaphor that could be more sensory.",
        "Some descriptions of 'secular stories' could be more specific to increase the 'show' factor."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strongly weighted toward 'showing'. The preacher uses the description of the painting and the laundry to let the hearer 'see' the problem before naming it."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably precise and avoids 'Canaanite' jargon. The preacher practices 'stewardship of language' by defining the stakes of the 'story' without retreating into vague pieties. There is a deliberate choice of words—using 'execution' instead of just 'death', and 'acquiescence' instead of 'sin'—which forces the hearer to confront the reality of the text. The distinction between the two Jerusalems is handled with theological nuance that remains accessible. The tone is sober, avoiding the 'superlative' trap of much American preaching.",
      "quotes": [
        "The friendly Chinese owners were obviously not aware of any liturgical violations.",
        "Our relationship to that particular locale is paradoxical; it is and is not central to our saving story.",
        "We are implicated in the powers of darkness just the same."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent avoidance of religious clichés; terms like 'Messiah' are contextualized.",
        "Nuanced handling of the 'Jews' vs 'Us' distinction in the crucifixion narrative.",
        "Clear, economical sentence structure that favors clarity over decoration."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The phrase 'greatest story ever told' is a slight cliché that borders on the generic.",
        "The transition to the Philippians quote is a bit 'teacherly' in its phrasing.",
        "The term 'cosmic powers' could be further demystified for a modern secular ear."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Religious jargon is minimal. When used (e.g., 'Passion', 'Messiah'), it is explained through the narrative action of the sermon."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a steady, rhythmic cadence, particularly in the repetition of the refrain 'This is your hour, and the power of darkness.' This creates a liturgical 'beat' that mirrors the solemnity of Holy Week. However, the sentence structure occasionally leans toward the 'academic-declarative' style, which can feel slightly like 'paper language' in the longer paragraphs about advertising and geo-politics. The rhythm is more oratorical than poetic, designed for a serious, attentive audience rather than a rhythmic, emotive response.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is your hour, and the power of darkness. [Repeated refrain]",
        "It is and is not central to our saving story.",
        "Lest I forget, lead me to Calvary."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of repetition (anaphora) with the central scripture verse.",
        "Good variation between short, punchy sentences and longer explanatory ones.",
        "The use of hymns ('All glory, laud and honor') integrates musical memory into the text."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Some paragraphs (e.g., the advertising section) are quite dense and lack oral 'breathing room'.",
        "The conclusion could benefit from more 'legato' poetic phrasing to contrast the 'staccato' of the darkness.",
        "Rhetorical figures like alliteration or parallelism are present but could be more intentional."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Primarily oral language, though the cultural analysis sections lean slightly toward a written essay style."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' and high precision. It avoids the kitsch of sentimental Easter language by grounding the discourse in concrete, sometimes jarring, imagery. The preacher demonstrates excellent stewardship of words, choosing 'execution' and 'power of darkness' to strip away religious comfort. While the rhythm is more steady than virtuosic, the repetition of the central theme creates a powerful atmospheric effect. It is a text that respects the hearer's intelligence while demanding their imaginative participation through vivid 'showing'."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Lowry-esque' plot: it begins with an upsetting of equilibrium (the 'disappearance' of Christianity in Jerusalem and the laundry), moves to the 'complicity' of the hearer, reaches a climax in the 'power of darkness' (the painting and the reactor), and finds a resolution in the 'other thief'. The movement from the 'false stories' of advertising to the 'true story' of the cross provides a compelling narrative arc. The tension is sustained by refusing to move to Easter Sunday too quickly, keeping the hearer in the 'Friday' reality of Palm Sunday.",
      "quotes": [
        "It was as though Christianity did not even exist in the city of its birth.",
        "No one is off the hook today.",
        "Let us be that thief today."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong 'upsetting' opening that creates immediate relevance.",
        "The 'turning point' is effectively placed in the shift from being 'spectators' to 'penitent sinners'.",
        "The conclusion provides a 'resolution' that is liturgically appropriate (the Eucharist)."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition from the 'advertising' section to the 'Jerusalem' section is a bit abrupt.",
        "The 'two Jerusalems' section slows the narrative momentum slightly with its theological abstraction.",
        "The invitation to Maundy Thursday feels like an administrative interruption in the plot."

      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey from cultural alienation to personal participation in the Passion."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. It performs 'reframing' (Cilliers) by placing the Passion story against the backdrop of modern advertising and nuclear technology. The biblical text is not a 'springboard' but a lens through which the 'secular stories' are judged and found wanting. The preacher respects the 'strangeness' of the donkey-procession while making it immediate through the lens of human fickleness. The integration of the 'Holocaust Museum' and the 'B Reactor' provides a profound contemporary frame for the 'power of darkness'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wearing Polo clothes offers the hope of entering Ralph Lauren's world of moneyed ease.",
        "It would be sort of like the Holocaust Museum.",
        "Those who shouted 'Hosanna!'... were essentially the same as those who yelled for his death."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of the cross through the lens of human 'technological achievement'.",
        "The connection between the 'bunnies' and the 'execution' exposes the kitsch of modern culture.",
        "The application (being the thief) flows organically from the narrative tension."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'Holy Land' news intro feels a bit dated compared to the more 'timeless' advertising critique.",
        "The connection between the 'Chinese laundry' and 'liturgical violations' is clever but slightly elitist.",
        "Could explore the 'Range Rover' / 'limitless horizon' metaphor more deeply in contrast to the 'cross'."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "The sermon successfully reframes the crucifixion not as a 'religious event' but as the 'true story' that exposes the 'false narratives' of our culture."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon is an 'open work of art' (Stark) in that it invites the hearer to 'see themselves' in various characters (Judas, Peter, the thief). It does not offer a 'cheap' happy ending; the 'power of darkness' is given its full weight. However, the preacher is quite directive in the 'I beg you' and 'do not let any secular story' sections, which leans toward a more 'closed' moral exhortation. The ending is open to the 'mystery' of the Eucharist, but the path to get there is fairly tightly controlled by the preacher's narrative logic.",
      "quotes": [
        "We will see ourselves as Judas... as Peter... as the crowd.",
        "I beg you, do not let any secular story or alternative story take priority.",
        "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The invitation to 'be the thief' allows for personal appropriation without coercion.",
        "Leaves the tension of the 'power of darkness' unresolved until the very end.",
        "Acknowledges the 'ambivalence' of the Palm Sunday crowd (and the congregation)."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'I beg you' section could be softer to allow the hearer more 'space' to choose.",
        "The 'Maundy Thursday' advertisement closes the aesthetic space for a moment.",
        "Could leave more 'unanswered questions' about the nature of the 'darkness' in the hearer's own life."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly polyvalent, offering multiple 'entry points' through different characters, but with a strong 'witness' stance that borders on the directive."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.67,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is a masterclass in 'reframing'. By setting the 'strange story' of Jesus against the 'seductive stories' of modern consumerism, the preacher creates a high-stakes drama. The narrative arc is well-paced, moving from external observation to internal complicity. It avoids the static 'three-point' sermon by functioning as a 'happening'—a liturgical event that prepares the hearer for Holy Week. The integration of text and context is seamless, making the ancient execution feel like a contemporary necessity."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a powerful antidote to religious kitsch. It explicitly mocks the kitsch of 'bunnies and eggs' and 'generic messages about springtime'. By introducing the 'horrible' painting of the naked Christ and the 'Nagasaki bomb' reactor, the preacher refuses the 'happy ending' and 'pre-chewed emotions' that Cilliers warns against. The emotion here is 'authentic' because it is rooted in the 'pain of suffering' and the 'viciousness' of the cross. It is a 'sober' Reformed aesthetic that finds beauty in the truth, however dark.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The Chinese laundry 'bedecked from stem to stern with bunnies'.",
      "Easter cards with 'generic messages about springtime and the renewal of nature'."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the Christ without a loincloth, showing the 'viciousness and cruelty'.",
      "The identification of the congregation with the crowd shouting 'Crucify him!'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'unsparing' gaze; the only risk is becoming 'anti-kitsch' as a new form of predictable 'grittiness'."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by first making the 'need' for grace palpable. By sustaining the tension of the 'hour of darkness', the preacher creates a 'space' where the thief's plea ('Remember me') becomes the only logical response. However, the space is slightly 'closed' by the preacher's strong pedagogical tone ('I want you to notice', 'I beg you'). The 'mystery' of God is respected in the 'paradox' of the two Jerusalems, but the sermon leans heavily on the 'witness' of the preacher to define that space.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained effectively; the 'darkness' is not resolved until the final paragraph.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'transcendent Jerusalem' is kept as a future mystery, not fully explained away.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails, but it is a 'costly grace' that requires the death of the 'secular self'.",
    "recommendation": "Allow for more silence or 'open endings' where the preacher's voice recedes and the 'Spirit's performance' takes over."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high level of homiletic aesthetics, particularly within the 'New Homiletic' tradition. Its strength lies in its 'reframing' of the gospel against the 'false narratives' of consumer culture. The preacher uses 'stewardship of language' to strip away the sentimental kitsch that often plagues Palm Sunday, replacing it with a 'sober beauty' that is both intellectually demanding and emotionally authentic. The 'poetics of language' are strong, characterized by vivid, often jarring imagery that 'shows' the power of darkness. The 'dramaturgy' is effective, leading the hearer on a journey from being a 'spectator' of a news item to a 'participant' in a cosmic drama. While the tone is occasionally a bit 'instructive' or 'pedagogical', the overall effect is the creation of a 'space for grace' that is both narrow (in its demands) and wide (in its promise).",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Profound 'reframing' of the Passion through modern cultural markers (advertising, nuclear technology).",
      "Absolute rejection of religious kitsch in favor of 'authentic' aesthetic depth.",
      "Strong narrative arc that moves from cultural critique to personal penitence."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduce the 'pedagogical' or 'administrative' interruptions (e.g., the Maundy Thursday ad).",
      "Increase the 'musicality' of the language in the more abstract theological sections.",
      "Allow for more 'openness' by reducing the direct 'begging' of the congregation."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Dramatic with a Sober-Reformed edge.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Paul Scott Wilson's 'Four Pages' (Trouble/Grace) and Johan Cilliers' 'Reframing'.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'post-Christian' or 'intellectually weary' hearers who are tired of superficial religious sentiment.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'poetic' rather than 'analytical' language for the 'heavenly Jerusalem'.",
      "Use the 'show, don't tell' principle even for the 'grace' movements of the sermon.",
      "Trust the narrative to do the work without the 'I beg you' exhortations."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically 'strong' sermon (7.5) that serves as an excellent example of how to handle 'dark' themes without falling into kitsch. It successfully 'reframes' reality for the hearer, making the ancient text an 'operative reality' in the present. It is a model of 'stewardship of language' and 'dramaturgical movement', held back from an '8' only by its slightly directive tone and occasional 'paper-language' density."
