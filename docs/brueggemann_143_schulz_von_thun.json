  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a solid exegetical framework based on the Book of Acts and Psalm 4. The preacher correctly identifies the 'Sache' (the core matter) as the resurrection of Jesus being an objective event that transcends human categories. There is a clear attempt to connect the biblical narrative of the lame beggar with contemporary social issues (health care, minimum wage). However, the theological depth remains somewhat horizontal. While it mentions the 'defeat of death,' it quickly pivots to socio-political applications. The Barthian 'Living Christ' is present but often mediated through the 'church's business' rather than standing as the sovereign Subject who acts independently of human programs.",
      "quotes": [
        "They did not debate whether the resurrection of Jesus was a spiritual or a physical event.",
        "The move from Easter talk to the Easter walk is from Jesus to the beggar.",
        "The Easter power of life is given in the world so that the deathly structures of greed can be transformed."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear structural movement from text to application.",
        "Strong emphasis on the 'wonder' that defies explanatory categories."

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The language is accessible, using common metaphors like 'talking the talk' and 'walking the walk'."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a personality that is highly structured and socially conscious. There is a sense of 'conscious self-presentation' as a teacher and social advocate. Little 'leaks' out regarding the preacher's own struggle with faith or the text; the 'I' is used primarily to introduce thoughts ('I had one other thought') rather than to share existential vulnerability. The tone is authoritative and confident, perhaps masking the inherent 'scandal' of the resurrection with a functionalist approach to what the church 'must do'. It is a 'diaconal' self-revelation in that it serves the message of social justice, but it lacks the 'trembling' one might expect when facing the empty tomb.",
      "quotes": [
        "I had one other thought about Easter talk and walk.",
        "We are Easter people... empowered to raise others to new life."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive (Zwanghaft). The sermon is characterized by a high need for order, clear lists (1, 2, 3), and a strong emphasis on the 'business' and 'work' of the church. It seeks to control the 'wonder' of Easter by channeling it into predictable ethical outcomes.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is subservient to the social-ethical agenda, but occasionally overshadows the 'God as Subject' by focusing on the 'human agents'.",
      "strengths": [
        "Reliable and clear structure.",
        "Avoids narcissistic over-sharing."

        "Allow for more 'Selbstenthüllung' (involuntary revelation) of faith's own amazement.",
        "Reduce the 'teacher' persona to allow for a 'fellow traveler' perspective."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher to Student' or 'Leader to Community'. The preacher uses the inclusive 'we', but it often feels like a 'we' of mobilization rather than a 'we' of shared brokenness. The tone is solidary yet demanding. There is a slight 'paternalistic' undertone when the preacher interprets the beggar's potential motives ('maybe to drink it up'), which defines the relationship with the 'other' (the poor) from a position of moral observation. The congregation is seen as a potential force for good, provided they follow the preacher's logic of moving from 'talk' to 'walk'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The beggar wants some alms, some cash—maybe to drink it up.",
        "It is the church’s business... to be about the Easter walk.",
        "We sign on—yet again—to talk the talk that transforms."

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward the 'Appeal' (Anspruch). While it starts with the 'Promise' (Zuspruch) of the resurrection, it rapidly converts this into a mandate for social action (health care, minimum wage, soup kitchens). The 'Red Side' is dominant. The risk here is moralism: the resurrection becomes a fuel for human effort rather than a rest for the soul. The 'payout' (a telling word choice) is defined by what *we* do. For a Barthian, this is a 'Law-heavy' sermon where the Gospel is the 'clothed power' used to achieve human-defined justice goals.",
      "quotes": [
        "The walk is accomplished by the apostles, that is, by the church.",
        "It is the church’s business... to share resources.",
        "So here is the payout!"

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The balance tilts heavily toward 'Anspruch' (Demand). The 'Zuspruch' (Promise) serves as a prerequisite for the work, rather than the goal itself.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "High. The listener may leave feeling that Easter is a 'to-do list' for social reform.",
      "strengths": [
        "Concrete and actionable applications.",
        "High directional force."

  "congruence_and_disruptions": {
    "congruence_judgment": "The sermon is congruent in its 'Compulsive' (Riemann) style; the structure, tone, and appeal all align toward a goal-oriented, ethical Christianity. However, there is a theological incongruence between the 'uncontrollable wonder' of Easter and the very 'controlled' social-programmatic application.",
    "dominant_side": "Red (Appeal)",
    "disruptions": "The primary disruption is 'Relationship Noise' caused by the moralizing speculation about the beggar's intentions, which clashes with the message of 'perfect health' and grace.",
    "healing_disruption": "The connection between the 'Author of Life' and 'Health Care' is a prophetic disruption that challenges a privatized faith, though it risks being merely political."

    "the_relational_ear_hears": "I am part of a 'business' (the church) that has a job to do, and I should be careful not to be like the 'shamed' beggar or the 'clinging' crowd.",
    "the_appeal_ear_hears": "I need to support health care reform and volunteer at the soup kitchen because that is what 'Easter people' do.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 5.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a competent example of 'Social Gospel' homiletics, utilizing the Easter narrative as a catalyst for ethical mobilization. From a Schulz von Thun perspective, the 'Red Side' (Appeal) is the engine of the message. The preacher successfully bridges the gap between ancient text and modern social structures (health care, minimum wage), making the 'Blue Side' (Content) relevant. However, the 'Green Side' (Self-revelation) remains somewhat shielded behind a teacher-persona, and the 'Yellow Side' (Relationship) is occasionally strained by moralizing assumptions. Theologically, the sermon risks 'psychologizing' the resurrection into a human 'empowerment' project. While the structure is clear and the delivery likely confident, it lacks the 'Barthian' awe where God remains the Subject. Instead, God provides the 'power' and the Church does the 'business'. It is a 'Satisfactory' sermon that fulfills its didactic purpose but misses the deeper existential 'rest' of the Gospel.",
    "barthian_warning": "High risk of 'Secularization of the Spirit'. The Holy Spirit is treated as a 'power source' for human ethical 'walking' rather than the sovereign Lord who judges and justifies.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Clear, memorable 'Talk/Walk' metaphor.",
      "Strong integration of the Psalm into the narrative.",
      "Direct relevance to contemporary societal issues."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce moralizing language regarding the 'beggar's' motives.",
      "Balance the 'Anspruch' (Demand) with more 'Zuspruch' (Promise).",
      "Shift from 'Church-as-Business' to 'Church-as-Witness'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A structurally sound, ethically urgent sermon that communicates effectively on an intellectual and moral level, but requires more theological depth and relational humility to reach the 'exceptional' category."
