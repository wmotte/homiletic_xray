    "sermon_start_end": "This is a very famous passage. “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” One of the commentaries I read when I was preparing this said this passage takes you right into the heart of what Christianity is all about. [...] If you’re not a disciple, you’re not having this peace of God worked into every corner of your life. “Come to me, all you who are [already] weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me. Let’s pray."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon stays close to the pericope. However, it leans heavily on general 'gospel' themes (grace vs. works) that could be preached from many Pauline texts, rather than isolating what is unique to Matthew 11.",
      "quotes": [
        "We’re going to learn from this text three things about that deep, inner rest.",
        "The center of gravity of this passage is obviously verses 28–30."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify what this specific invitation to 'rest' says that cannot be found in, for example, Ephesians 2 or Romans 5. Focus more on the specific Matthean context of the 'wise and learned' vs 'little children'."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher explains the 'yoke' metaphor and the 'wise and learned,' but the exegesis is quickly overtaken by modern literary references (Horace, Ibsen). The specific religious-historical context of the Pharisaic 'yoke of the law' is mentioned but not deeply explored in its original setting.",
      "quotes": [
        "A yoke was something you put on a beast of burden (a mule or an ox)...",
        "In those days, when you wanted to be a disciple of a teacher, you went to live with the teacher."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the linguistic and historical tension between the 'yoke of the Torah' and the 'yoke of Jesus' using the promised Hebrew/Greek background Dekker requires."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Application is a strength here. The preacher identifies the 'zeitgeist' of New York City, workaholism, and the 'life lie.' It avoids vague pietism by naming specific modern burdens like professional success and parental expectations.",
      "quotes": [
        "New York City was started as a trading post. It’s a place to make money.",
        "I made the quality of my work the measure of my worth."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application remains tied to the *text's* specific logic of 'revelation to infants' rather than general psychological observations about burnout."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a thematic structure (Need, Character, How) which often separates the 'then' from the 'now.' While the contemporary examples are vivid, they sometimes feel like a bridge away from the text rather than being 'expounded' with the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "1. The need for rest... 2. The character of this rest... 3. How to get this rest."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the three-point lecture structure. Try to draw the hearer into the movement of Jesus' prayer (v25-27) as the basis for the invitation (v28-30) simultaneously."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon strongly emphasizes 'misery' (the burden of self-reproach) and 'redemption' (Christ’s rest). 'Gratitude' is present in the call to discipleship/yoke, though it is slightly less developed than the psychological analysis of misery.",
      "quotes": [
        "You’re already yoked to something... That’s burnout. That’s terrible.",
        "My Savior’s obedience and blood hide all my transgressions from view."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'gratitude' (the easy yoke) more explicitly a response of the Spirit-led life rather than just 'joining a community'."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher mentions being 'lost in the veil of illusion' and the 'cosmic restlessness' of the cross. However, the 'two ways' (destruction vs. life) are softened into psychological states rather than the ultimate destination Dekker emphasizes.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you think you’re spiritually free, you’re not... it is fatal if you try to get it.",
        "He was getting a taste of the cosmic restlessness we deserve."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Be more explicit about the 'broad way' that leads to destruction. The seriousness of the choice to 'take the yoke' needs more ontological weight beyond psychological relief."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "Strong Christocentric focus. Christ is not just an example but the substitute who bears the 'cosmic restlessness.' The doctrine of the two natures is implicit in the discussion of Christ as the 'one Lord' and 'Master.'",
      "quotes": [
        "I came in weakness to bear you judgment, your punishment.",
        "He was cosmically restless, because God was not with him."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly connect Christ’s deity (v25-27) to his ability to give rest, as Dekker notes that Christ as telos requires Him to be God."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At approximately 24 minutes, the sermon meets Dekker's requirement for breadth to achieve depth. It allows space for literary and cultural engagement.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this length but shift some 'breadth' from secular quotes to deeper biblical-theological exposition."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily in its formal structure and its tendency to prioritize psychological/cultural analysis over rigorous linguistic exegesis. While it identifies the 'misery' of the modern hearer effectively, it risks turning the specific Word of God into a general solution for burnout. It succeeds in maintaining a sharp Christocentric focus and sufficient length for depth.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application to the 'zeitgeist' of New York and the 'life lie'.",
      "Strong substitutionary atonement theology (Christ bearing restlessness).",
      "Adequate length allowing for cultural dialogue."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Thematic structure (1-2-3) separates exposition from application.",
      "Insufficient use of original languages or specific biblical-theological context of Matthew.",
      "The 'two ways' are framed more as psychological health vs. burden rather than eternal life vs. destruction."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a functioning sermon that rightly proclaims the Gospel, yet it borders on being a 'speech about the gospel' rather than a recreation of this specific Bible passage. It is a 'satisfactory to good' (6.5/10) example of homiletics that needs more 'specific' biblical weight to meet Dekker's high bar."
