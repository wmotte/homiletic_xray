    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and game-free. It utilizes a strong Adult ego state to process trauma while inviting the Nurturing Parent and Free Child to provide hope and creativity. It avoids the common homiletical trap of using tragedy to fuel a Critical Parent 'shame' cycle. Instead, it promotes autonomy by framing Christian practice as a choice of 'alertness' and 'action' rather than blind submission.",

      "Slight risk of the 'Long Game' metaphor being used to minimize 'Short Run' pain if not handled carefully.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'we' language to maintain Adult-Adult symmetry. Ensure the 'Long Game' doesn't become a 'Bait & Switch' where current suffering is dismissed as irrelevant."
