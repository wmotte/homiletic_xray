    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "While the sermon is rhetorically vibrant and aims at encouragement, it creates a psychologically precarious environment. By pathologizing sadness ('no business living in valleys of depression') and using derogatory labels for 'incorrect' joy ('idiots'), it sets up a Critical Parent framework. The listener is encouraged to enter a 'Free Child' state, but only under the strict supervision of the Preacher's 'Parent' definitions. This can lead to 'faked' joy or suppressed grief in the congregation.",

      "Reduce the use of Critical Parent labels like 'idiots' and 'fools' for those with different perspectives."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Incorporate more Adult ego state by acknowledging the reality that faith and deep sadness often coexist (Lament). Instead of 'You should be glad,' try 'We can explore the resources for gladness even when life feels like a swamp.'"
