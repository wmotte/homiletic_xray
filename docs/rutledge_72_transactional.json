It operates almost entirely in the Adult ego state, using logic, historical context, and linguistic analysis to challenge the listeners. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Drama Triangle by refusing to cast the congregation as victims of a secular age or the preacher as their rescuer. Instead, it empowers the listeners by inviting them to reclaim their autonomy as 'witnesses' to a sovereign 'Subject.'",
