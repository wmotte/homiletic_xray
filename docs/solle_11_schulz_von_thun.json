    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The 'Sache' is the Passion of Christ interpreted through the lens of liberation theology. The preacher provides a clear exegetical movement through the Johannine text, focusing on the trial before Pilate. The theological depth lies in the identification of Christ with the 'victims of history' (Barth's 'living Christ' in the poor). However, the factual side is heavily colored by socio-political data (Mutlangen, South Africa, debt crises). While the exegesis of 'Truth' vs. 'Victory' is profound, the sermon risks reducing the dogmatic 'fides quae' to a purely horizontal, political sociology. The 'blue' side serves as a mirror for global injustice rather than a neutral transmission of doctrine.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a deeply committed, politically active, and empathetic faith. There is no 'image management' here; the 'I' is vulnerable and complicit ('Ich habe dich geschlagen'). The self-revelation is 'diaconal' because the preacher includes themselves in the circle of guilt. There is a palpable tension between the preacher's identity as a 'winner' in the First World and their spiritual allegiance to the 'losers'. The authenticity is high because the preacher does not exempt themselves from the 'system of profit and death'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ich unterstützte das wirtschaftliche System, das Folter braucht.",

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive/Schizoid Hybrid. The 'Depressive' side shows in the deep empathy for the suffering and the search for harmony through solidarity.

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined by shared guilt and collective responsibility. The preacher speaks 'at eye level' by using 'we' and 'us' consistently. However, there is a latent 'paternalistic' tone in the rhetorical questions that corner the hearer. The preacher acts as a 'prophetic conscience'. The relationship noise occurs where the preacher assumes the congregation shares their specific political affiliations (e.g., the peace movement in Mutlangen). This can alienate those who feel 'preached at' regarding specific political tactics rather than the Gospel.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon is high on 'Anspruch' (Demand). The appeal is for a radical change of lifestyle, political resistance, and solidarity with the poor. The 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is found in the idea that God is *with* us in the suffering and that Christ's freedom is available even in 'prison'. However, the theological weight leans heavily toward the Law (conviction of sin) and the call to action. In a Barthian sense, the 'Gift' is the presence of God in the 'Fire', but the 'Task' (disrupting the system) is more prominently articulated.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wer immer die Wahrheit selbst haben will, muss den Geist des Sieges austreiben.",

        "Avoids 'cheap grace'.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a powerful, prophetic sermon that masterfully uses the Four-Sides Model to bridge the gap between a 2000-year-old text and contemporary global crises. The preacher (likely Dorothee Sölle or someone in her tradition) avoids the 'Compulsive' trap of dry doctrine, instead opting for a 'Depressive-Prophetic' solidarity. Theologically, it follows the Barthian 'Christological concentration' by seeing God only in the suffering Christ, though it risks 'psychologizing' the revelation by making it entirely dependent on our 'action' and 'existence' (Immink's warning). The congruence is exceptional; the preacher does not hide behind the pulpit but stands under the cross with the congregation. The 'Yellow' side is the most vulnerable, as the intensity of the 'Red' appeal and the specificity of the political examples may alienate those not already aligned with the 'Peace and Justice' movement. However, as a piece of communicative homiletics, it succeeds in making the 'Sache' (the Passion) unavoidable.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a risk of 'horizontalism' where God becomes merely a synonym for 'the suffering of the poor' rather than the Sovereign Subject who acts *upon* us.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Radical congruence between preacher and message.",
      "Brilliant re-definition of 'Truth' as existential participation.",
      "Effective use of 'we-language' to foster collective responsibility."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Balance the heavy 'Anspruch' with more explicit 'Zuspruch' of the Resurrection.",
      "Reduce political specificity to allow the Gospel to critique all political sides.",
      "Ensure the 'Factual Ear' receives more dogmatic grounding in the 'extra nos' of salvation."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, challenging sermon that achieves communicative integrity through radical authenticity and prophetic urgency, though it teeters on the edge of moralistic overwhelm."
