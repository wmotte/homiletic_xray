    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in pulpit rhetoric. By utilizing a strong Adult ego state, the preacher provides the congregation with tools for reality-testing (e.g., the 'test' for angels, the analysis of corporate sin). The use of the 'Army' metaphor is carefully deconstructed to prevent it from becoming a vehicle for the Persecutor role, instead reframing it as non-violent endurance. The preacher treats the listeners as partners in a cosmic reality rather than children to be scolded or victims to be pitied.",
    "strengths": [

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Barbie doll' comment borders on Critical Parent sarcasm.",
      "The transition from 'liturgical liberty' to 'simple test' for angels is a slight jump in logic."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use concrete, contemporary examples that highlight individual agency. This keeps the sermon in the 'Here-and-Now' (Adult) and prevents the 'Ain't It Awful' game."
