    "summary": "This sermon is a masterclass in using the Adult ego position to dismantle a dysfunctional internal Drama Triangle. By redefining 'sin' from specific acts (Child compliance) to a universal condition (Adult reality), the preacher removes the 'Gimmick' (guilt) that religious games usually exploit. The impact is one of psychological liberation and the promotion of authentic autonomy.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to validate the listener's Adult capacity to process complex theological truths without reverting to coercive Parent language."
