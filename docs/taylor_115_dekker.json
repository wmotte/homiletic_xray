It cannot be long! We'll laugh as in days of old, and we'll go to see Jesus. God be with you, Sam. God be with you, till we meet! Till we meet, till we meet, till we meet on the other shore."

    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon is not an exposition of a Bible passage but a eulogy for a deceased friend. Scripture is used as a 'canvassed' ornament rather than the source. The preacher admits to searching for a word to fit the man, rather than letting the text speak its own unique word.",
      "quotes": [
        "I began canvassing Scripture for some appropriate word.",
        "It was as if the speaker and writer was looking in the direction of Samuel Proctor when these words were written."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must start with the text's own internal logic and what it says that can be found nowhere else, rather than using the text to validate a human biography."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "There is a brief, superficial mention of Smyrna (Izmir), but it serves as a scenic backdrop rather than theological exegesis. There is no engagement with the Greek text or the specific historical-theological crisis of the church in Smyrna.",
      "quotes": [
        "One beholds it today, modern-day Izmir, as it rises up from the Aegean Sea, crowned by the ruins of a magnificent castle."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application is entirely focused on the life of the deceased. While concrete in its biographical details, it fails Dekker's requirement of applying the text to the 'hearers of today' in their spiritual and social reality. It is a speech about a 'biblical character' (recast as Proctor) rather than a sermon.",

        "Faithful at the lectern of the academy — faithful in the pulpit of Christendom — faithful as he walked among us."

      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Because there is almost no exposition, there is no weaving. The text is a springboard for a biographical narrative. The 'present of revelation' is replaced by the 'memory of the deceased'.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Spirit spoke to me of what Jesus spoke to the church at Smyrna... It was as if the speaker and writer was looking in the direction of Samuel Proctor."

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on gratitude for a life lived, but it lacks the depth of 'misery' (man's state before God). Redemption is treated as a reward for a life well-lived (faithfulness) rather than an objective act of God in Christ that addresses human lostness.",
      "quotes": [
        "He went directly from the trials of this life to claim his reward.",
        "I will measure your service. I will take account of what you have been."

      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are absent. There is an assumption of universal 'arrival' at the 'gate'. The seriousness of being lost (temporal or eternal) is not addressed; the tone is one of inevitable triumph based on human character.",

        "He went directly to see the King.",
        "I understand that it's a land of pure delight, where saints immortal reign."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the 'Lord' and the one to be seen at the end, but the 'telos' of the sermon is actually Samuel Proctor. Grace is overshadowed by the 'reward' for Proctor's 'faithfulness'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Sam Proctor was not only driven, he was pulled by the magnificence of his Lord.",
        "We'll laugh as in days of old, and we'll go to see Jesus."

      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 11-12 minutes, the sermon is significantly too short according to Dekker's 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for theological depth.",

  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text is a funeral oration or eulogy, not a sermon according to Dekker's criteria. It lacks a central Bible passage that is recreated into a current word; instead, it uses Scripture as a decorative frame for a human biography. There is no serious exegesis, the 'two ways' are ignored in favor of a certain celestial arrival, and the length is insufficient for theological depth.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete biographical application of the concept of 'faithfulness'.",
      "Strong use of humanities/metaphor (the 'mighty oak', 'rough gingham vs. rich brocade')."

    "weaknesses": [
      "Subordination of Scripture to human biography.",
      "Lack of exegetical rigor regarding the original context of Revelation.",
      "Absence of the 'misery' component; redemption is presented as a reward for merit.",
      "Insufficient duration to achieve the 'breadth' required for 'depth'."

    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon. It is a speech about a 'biblical character' (Proctor) delivered in a worship service. It fails the formal definition of exposition and application of a specific Bible passage."
