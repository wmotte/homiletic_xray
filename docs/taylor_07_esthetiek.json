    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes effective, sensory imagery that moves from the legendary to the domestic. It successfully avoids purely abstract theological discourse by grounding 'renewal' in concrete human experiences: the 'wrinkles of the years', the 'stench' of political oppression (implied), and the 'mercy seat' of the temple. The preacher follows Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' by painting the 'gray moods' and 'dusty roads' of life. The imagery of the eagle is balanced by the 'hard, dusty road', preventing the sermon from becoming overly ethereal. However, some metaphors like 'fountain of youth' are slightly conventional, though repurposed well to contrast with spiritual reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "erase the wrinkles of the years, to take from the footsteps the heaviness of the weight of many winters",
        "mount up like eagles, sometimes to the upper pure air where sense and sorrow molest no more",
        "the farmer goes on in a dry and barren season... with a look now and then toward the skies"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong use of sensory details (wrinkles, weight, sunlight, dust).",
        "Effective contrast between 'high places' and 'common day'.",
        "Vivid depiction of the 'morning years' vs. 'noontime' of life."

        "Reduce reliance on well-worn literary tropes like the 'fountain of youth'.",

        "Use more original metaphors for the 'humdrum of living' to avoid clichés."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "The sermon leans heavily toward 'showing' through the use of narrative illustrations (the farmer, the college freshmen) rather than merely defining 'waiting'."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and exhibits what McEntyre calls 'stewardship of language'. There is a notable absence of 'Canaanite jargon'; instead, the preacher uses a vocabulary that is both accessible and dignified. The choice of words like 'fretfulness', 'cadences', and 'beleaguered' shows a high level of linguistic care. The preacher nuances the human condition, distinguishing between 'ecstatic happiness' and 'steady gladness'. Every sentence feels intentional, contributing to a sober beauty that avoids the 'aestheticism' warned against in Reformed traditions while maintaining high literary quality.",
      "quotes": [
        "forgive us our fretfulness and the fever of our ways",
        "the glad thunders and gentle sighings of his oratorio",
        "that kind of laboring in confidence which I used to see in my native clime"

        "Some sentences are slightly long, which may challenge oral clarity.",
        "The transition between the 'legend' and the 'Isaiah' section could be more concise.",
        "Occasional use of 'thou/thy' in prayer contrasts sharply with the modern prose of the body."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of unexplained jargon. Terms like 'mercy seat' are used liturgically but the overall tone is humanistic and relatable."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a rhythmic cadence reminiscent of the 'symphonies' it describes. The preacher uses alliteration ('music and might, beauty and bravery, poetry and power') and parallelism to create a sense of movement. The structure of the sentences often mirrors the content: shorter, punchier sentences for action and longer, flowing sentences for reflection. This 'musicality' ensures the sermon is an oral event rather than a dry document. The inclusion of the hymn at the end provides a literal musical resolution to the rhetorical rhythm established throughout.",
      "quotes": [
        "music and might, beauty and bravery, poetry and power, so perfectly blended",
        "all the world's a song and our hearts are filled and thrilled with an unutterable gladness",
        "Waiting while working, or better still, confident and expectant while doing what needs to be done"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Masterful use of alliteration and triplets.",
        "Strong rhythmic flow that aids memorability.",
        "Effective use of 'staccato' vs 'legato' phrasing."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The middle section on 'running' becomes slightly repetitive in its rhythm.",
        "Ensure the 'Handel' reference doesn't distract from the biblical text's own rhythm.",
        "The conclusion could benefit from a more rhythmic 'crescendo' before the hymn."

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The language of the sermon is characterized by a 'sober beauty' and high literary precision. It avoids the pitfalls of religious jargon by translating theological concepts into the 'light of common day'. The imagery is vivid and sensory, effectively 'showing' the reality of renewal rather than just 'telling' it. The musicality is a standout feature, using rhetorical figures that honor the oral nature of preaching. It reflects a deep stewardship of words, where form and content are inextricably linked, creating an aesthetic experience that is both dignified and deeply human."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot'. It begins by upsetting the equilibrium with the 'pathetic' attempt to erase time, then moves through the three-fold promise of the text (eagle, run, walk). This is not a static three-point sermon because it follows a descending arc of life—from the 'ecstasy' of youth to the 'monotony' of the long pull. The 'turning point' occurs in the redefinition of 'waiting' as active, confident labor. This movement from the 'high places' to the 'dusty road' creates a palpable sense of journey for the hearer, though the conclusion is somewhat predictable.",
      "quotes": [
        "One of the most pathetic, if not tragic, things in the world is to see someone trying to erase the deep scorings of the years",
        "The tempo must recede, for we cannot survive for too long the times of pure ecstasy",
        "The kind of expectant waiting... is not the idleness of expecting our dreams to fall full-grown from the skies"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear movement from 'ecstasy' to 'monotony', mirroring human life.",
        "Effective 'upsetting' of the equilibrium in the introduction.",
        "The redefinition of 'waiting' provides a necessary intellectual and spiritual pivot."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition between 'running' and 'walking' is a bit soft; the tension could be tightened.",
        "The 'eagle' section feels slightly disconnected from the 'political oppression' mentioned in the prayer.",
        "The ending, while comforting, lacks a final 'surprise' or 'openness'."

      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey that follows the psychological and spiritual arc of a human life, rather than a static theological outline."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels at 'reframing' (Cilliers). It takes the ancient promise of Isaiah and places it directly into the context of mid-century struggle—mentioning 'political oppression' and 'discouraging discriminations'. The integration is organic; the 'waiting' of the Israelites is synthesized with the 'waiting' of a farmer or a 'beleaguered army'. It respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the eagle imagery) while making it relevant to the 'light of common day'. The preacher offers a new frame: waiting is not passivity, but 'laboring in confidence'.",
      "quotes": [
        "our land, burdened by the ugly weight of its discouraging discriminations",
        "Heaven lies about us in our infancy... fade into the light of common day",
        "This waiting on God... is that kind of laboring in confidence which I used to see in my native clime among farmers"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Surprising and natural connection between the farmer and the prophet.",
        "Honesty about the 'common day' prevents the text from feeling like a fairy tale.",
        "Successful 'reframing' of the word 'wait'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could more explicitly link the 'eagle' imagery to the specific 'political oppression' mentioned.",
        "The Wordsworth quote is beautiful but could be more tightly integrated into the exegesis.",
        "More 'contextual' examples of 'running and not being weary' in the face of injustice would add weight."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes, the sermon reframes 'waiting' from passive idleness to active, expectant endurance."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "As an 'open work of art' (Stark), the sermon is moderately successful. It acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence'—the sweat, the dust, and the 'hopes long deferred'. It does not offer a 'cheap happy ending' but a 'power to keep going'. However, the ending is somewhat 'sealed' with a traditional hymn and a definitive 'You can make it'. While comforting, it leaves less room for the 'resistance' or 'unresolved questions' that Stark advocates. The preacher acts more as a 'witness' (Long) than a 'teacher', which invites the hearer in, but the path is fairly well-paved.",
      "quotes": [
        "youthful dreams that turned to dust in our hands",
        "I had fainted unless I had believed to see the Lord in the land of the living",
        "You can make it then, pilgrim, since God is near"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the reality of 'dust' and 'sweat' (no kitsch).",
        "Invites the hearer to see their own 'monotony' as a site of grace.",
        "The use of the hymn allows for a communal, rather than just individual, appropriation."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The conclusion is a bit too 'neat'; it could leave a lingering question.",
        "Allow more room for the person who *does* faint, despite waiting.",
        "The 'eagle' section could be more polyvalent—what does it mean for the oppressed?"
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "The sermon is largely monovalent in its goal (encouragement), though it leaves room for the hearer's personal 'dusty road'."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is a well-crafted journey from the heights of ecstasy to the reality of the 'dusty road'. It avoids the static nature of traditional three-point sermons by creating a narrative arc that mirrors the human lifecycle. The integration of text and context is a major strength, particularly through the 'reframing' of waiting as active labor. While the sermon is structurally sound and provides a clear 'space for grace', it leans toward a 'closed' conclusion that prioritizes consolation over the 'openness' of unresolved mystery."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It explicitly rejects the 'kitsch' of the fountain of youth and the 'vain imaginings' of trying to erase age through cosmetics or new marriages. By acknowledging that 'youthful dreams turn to dust', the preacher avoids the 'happy ending' cliché. The emotion feels authentic because it is rooted in the 'sweat' and 'weariness' of real life. It does not offer 'immediate comfort' but a 'strength for the long pull', which requires sustaining the tension of the 'gray moods'.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'enchanting legend' of Ponce de Leon (used as a foil to true renewal).",
      "The 'vain imaginings' of erasing years through clothes or cosmetics."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of 'the light of common day' where dreams turn to dust.",
      "The image of the farmer plowing in a 'dry and barren season'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this rigorous honesty about the 'hard, dusty road' to ensure the 'eagle' moments don't slip into sentimentality."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace by validating the 'humdrum of living' as a place where God is present. Cilliers’ 'Inter-esse' is present in the tension between the 'already' of God's promise and the 'not yet' of the parched field. The sermon does not moralize ('you must work harder') but points to a 'mercy which will attend your path'. However, the 'space' is slightly narrowed by the very clear, almost didactic explanation of what 'waiting' means, leaving less room for the 'unavailable' mystery.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'ecstasy' and 'monotony' is well-sustained throughout the middle of the sermon.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'mysterious energies' are mentioned, but the sermon tends to explain them through the farmer/army analogies.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the 'power' is described as a gift to be received through waiting, not a result of human effort.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'mysterious energies' to remain slightly more mysterious; don't feel the need to explain every mechanism of grace."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.4,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'Sober-Reformed' meets 'Narrative-Dramatic' preaching. Its primary strength lies in its 'stewardship of language' and its ability to 'reframe' biblical concepts for a contemporary audience facing both personal weariness and social oppression. The preacher avoids the 'kitsch' of easy answers by grounding the promise of Isaiah in the 'dust' and 'sweat' of everyday life. The musicality of the prose creates an 'event' that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant. While the structure follows a traditional descending arc, it feels dynamic because it connects so deeply with the universal human experience of aging and the 'fading' of youthful ideals. The sermon successfully creates a 'space for grace' by shifting the focus from human striving to 'waiting on the tides of God'.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional musicality and rhythmic cadence of the prose.",
      "Authentic, anti-kitsch approach to human suffering and aging.",
      "Effective reframing of 'waiting' as an active, expectant labor."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The conclusion could be more 'open' to allow for more varied hearer appropriation.",
      "The transition between the 'high days' and 'common days' could be sharpened.",
      "The 'eagle' imagery could be more concretely linked to the 'political oppression' mentioned in the prayer."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Poetic-Imagistic with a Sober-Reformed core.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to hearers who value literary depth, intellectual honesty about life's hardships, and a dignified, non-manipulative emotional tone.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer with a reflective question.",
      "Incorporate more 'staccato' action-oriented imagery to balance the 'legato' reflection.",
      "Deepen the 'polyphony' by including a voice of 'resistance' more explicitly."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a highly effective aesthetic work that honors both the biblical text and the human condition. It avoids the 'religious kitsch' that plagues much contemporary preaching by refusing to offer cheap comfort. Instead, it uses precise language and rhythmic beauty to lead the hearer into a 'sanity of the spirit'. It is a model of how 'form is content', where the beauty of the language itself becomes an argument for the beauty of the grace it proclaims. While it could benefit from more 'openness' in its conclusion, it remains a powerful 'performance' of the Gospel."
