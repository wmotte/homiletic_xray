    "sermon_start_end": "Some years ago I shared a series of lectures and sermons in Florida with my Brooklyn colleague Dr. Harry Wright, the Cornerstone Church preacher. On our last morning together, Dr. Wright spoke with memorable pithiness of the event from the story of the man born blind. [...] Some of us know 'he brought us from a mighty long way,' found us way down and lifted us way up, found us ignorant and sent us to school, found us friendless and put friends all around us, found us naked and clothed us, found us nothing and made something out of us. On this we may speak with authority."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses John 9 as a narrative framework but quickly pivots to general themes of 'experience' and 'testimony'. It fails to identify what is unique to this specific text that cannot be found elsewhere. It treats the text as an illustration for a general truth about personal testimony.",
      "quotes": [
        "The world needs experience's testimony about the goodness of God",
        "There is authority in experience. This man who received his sight expressed it"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the specific theological weight of the 'man born blind'—particularly the link between physical sight and spiritual recognition of Christ's divinity—rather than reducing it to a general 'experience'."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is superficial. While it mentions the Pharisees and the disciples' question about sin, it lacks depth regarding the Johannine context of 'signs' (semeia) or the Sabbath conflict. The preacher relies on anecdotal insights from a colleague rather than scholarly exposition.",
      "quotes": [
        "Dr. Wright spoke with memorable pithiness... I shall never forget his piercing insight",
        "Those who make a study of such things tell us that we have some six instances of blindness"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Engage with the Greek text and the specific theological tension of the Sabbath healing in John's Gospel to ground the sermon in historical-theological reality."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete in its imagery (drugstores, burned churches, school) but leans toward a 'success' theology. It addresses the zeitgeist of skepticism but counters it with individualistic emotionalism rather than the objective Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "When our church had burned and we were relocated on Adelphi Street",
        "found us ignorant and sent us to school, found us friendless and put friends all around us"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond social and material 'uplift' to the spiritual application of being 'expounded' by the text's judgment and grace."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a 'running commentary' style. While exposition and application are not strictly separated into two blocks, they are mixed in a way that the application often overwhelms the text. The text serves the application, rather than the application emerging from the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is but one step for me to go on to say that much of our having to wait for answers to our prayers..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'present of revelation' is achieved by letting the text's own categories (light vs. darkness) dictate the contemporary analysis."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon addresses misery (blindness, sin) and redemption (healing), but it risks making man the subject in a way that borders on the psychological. The 'gratitude' part is present but framed as human 'authority' and 'experience' rather than a Spirit-awakened response to the objective Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "Our sins exist to show God's power to cleanse them.",
        "The world needs 'bright hearts' and encouragement givers."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Refocus misery not just as 'problems' or 'hurts' but as the radical inability to see God without Christ's intervention."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are largely absent. The sermon is overwhelmingly optimistic and 'radiant'. The Pharisees are dismissed as 'faultfinders' and 'pessimists' rather than representatives of the real possibility of being 'lost in time' or eternity through spiritual blindness.",
      "quotes": [
        "Ask God to bring you to a radiant hopefulness, an authentic Christian optimism",
        "If you can't speak a good word, shut up"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the gravity of remaining in one's sins (John 9:41), which is the 'broad way' mentioned in the text's conclusion."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is central as the healer, and his divinity is implied. However, he is often presented as a 'divine drugstore' or a means to an end (human improvement) rather than the telos of the sermon for his own sake. The focus shifts from Christ's person to the man's 'experience' of him.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus opened a pharmacy, a divine drugstore, on the dirty road",
        "It is not the clay—it is Christ who heals."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Shift the focus from the 'authority of experience' to the 'authority of Christ' who creates the experience."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 16.5 minutes, the sermon falls short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. This lack of 'breadth' results in a lack of 'depth', as the sermon relies on rhetorical flourishes and anecdotes rather than sustained theological reflection.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical and dogmatic sections to reach the 20-minute threshold, allowing for a more thorough 'exposition' of the text's unique claims."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily due to its elevation of human experience over the objective Word of God. It functions more as a motivational speech on 'testimony' than an exposition of a specific Bible passage. It lacks the necessary length for depth and avoids the 'two ways' by reducing the Pharisees to mere 'pessimists'.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of concrete, vivid imagery that connects with the congregation's social reality.",
      "Clear identification of Christ as the source of healing, maintaining a basic Christocentric focus."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (under 20 minutes) prevents deep theological drilling.",
      "Theological reductionism: the text is used to validate 'experience' rather than the text expounding the hearer.",
      "Absence of the 'two ways': the possibility of being lost is replaced by a call to 'optimism'."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "According to Dekker’s definition, this is an inadequate sermon. It fails the formal requirement of length and the substantive requirement of specificity. It prioritizes the 'authority of experience' over the 'authority of the Word', making man's testimony the subject rather than God's specific revelation in John 9."
