However, it flirts with 'NIGYSOB' and 'Ain't It Awful' by setting up 'secular elites' as a straw man to be mocked. This can create a 'Parent-Child' dependency where the listener relies on the preacher to tell them why the world is wrong, rather than developing their own Free Child spontaneity.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to present the 'ancient wisdom' without needing to make the 'modern wisdom' look 'laughable.' This allows the listener to choose the Gospel from a position of Free Child attraction rather than Adapted Child reaction against the world."
