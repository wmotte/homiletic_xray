    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of Nurturing Parent preaching. While it offers comfort, it reinforces a dependency model where the listener is a 'Victim' needing a 'Rescuer.' The use of 'trembling' and 'shame' regarding social programs (nursing homes, etc.) shifts the tone into Critical Parent territory. It successfully engages the 'Child' ego through beauty and song but fails to empower the 'Adult' ego to make a reasoned, autonomous decision without emotional coercion.",

      "Infantilization of the listener by providing a scripted dialogue for their inner life."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try asking the congregation more open-ended questions that require Adult processing rather than providing the 'script' of what they should say to God. Reduce the use of shame-based imperatives."
