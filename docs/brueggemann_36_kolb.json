    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively utilizes the 'Mother's Day' context to ground the biblical narrative in a universal human experience. It moves beyond abstract 'tradition' by personifying it through the mother-child relationship. The description of a child's first night away from home provides a visceral, recognizable emotional hook. However, the 'crisis' of Peter is described more than it is dramatized, keeping the hearer at a slight distance from Peter's immediate sensory experience.",

        "No wonder a little child gets weepy at bedtime the first night away from home, yearning for what is reliable and familiar.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon pauses to analyze why the transition from family rules to Gospel freedom is difficult. It explores the 'problem' of exclusion as a defense mechanism. It provides a cultural critique of how love becomes 'circumscribed and limited by fear.' While it identifies the problem well, it could delve deeper into the specific sociological reasons why modern congregations struggle with 'the other' beyond just familial upbringing.",
      "quotes": [

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The theological 'Big Idea' is clear: the Gospel requires an 'unlearning' of exclusive traditions to embrace God's expansive newness. The sermon connects Acts, Galatians, John, and Revelation into a coherent theological framework. The exegesis of the Levitical laws provides a logical foundation for Peter's resistance. The conceptual move from 'family rules' to 'Gospel commandment' is logically sound but stays at a high level of abstraction.",

The sermon identifies that we are being led to 'new awarenesses' and 'new duties,' but it does not specify what a congregant should do on Monday morning to 'unlearn' a specific prejudice. It invites a change of heart but offers few handles for a change of habit.",

It falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase, providing few concrete handles for the congregation to practice the 'unlearning' it advocates. The theological work is solid, linking multiple biblical traditions into a coherent theme of divine 'newness.' However, the transition from the specific historical crisis of Peter (kosher laws) to modern social issues (race, gender) is handled with broad strokes that lack the same exegetical precision applied to the Acts text. The sermon effectively addresses the Diverging and Assimilating learning styles but leaves the Converging learner without a clear path forward.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a well-crafted theological reflection that excels in the 'Visionary' and 'Declarative' quadrants of Anderson’s model. It successfully takes the hearer through the first three phases of Kolb’s cycle, creating a clear sense of the 'what' and 'why' of the Gospel’s expansive nature. Its primary limitation is its lack of pragmatic specificity; it diagnoses the human condition and declares the divine solution but stops short of guiding the hearer in the 'Active Experimentation' of that solution. For a congregation seeking intellectual and emotional inspiration, it is highly effective; for those seeking practical discipleship tools, it requires further development in the pragmatic task."
