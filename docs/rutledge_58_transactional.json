    "risk_explanation": "There is a slight risk of a 'Nurturing Parent -> Dependent Child' transaction at the end when offering the 'remedy,' but it is mitigated by the emphasis on the listener's autonomy to 'see sense' or 'turn away'."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in homiletics. By using the Adult ego state to analyze the text's irony, the preacher avoids the trap of the Critical Parent. He identifies common human vulnerabilities ('the but') without exploiting them for guilt, instead using them to build a bridge of shared humanity. The sermon promotes autonomy by suggesting that God works through 'nobodies' and simple, accessible means, rather than through dependency on religious elites or the preacher himself.",

      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement.",
      "Identification with the listener's struggle (shared 'Child' vulnerability).",
      "Deconstruction of power hierarchies that foster dysfunctional Parent-Child dynamics."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'but' metaphor could potentially trigger an 'Adapted Child' response of shame if not handled carefully, though the preacher balances this well."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use irony and narrative distance to allow the 'Adult' to process difficult truths. Maintain the 'I'm OK, You're OK' stance by including yourself in the human condition of 'leprosy'."
