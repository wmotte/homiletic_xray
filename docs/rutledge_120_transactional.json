    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' often found in homiletics. By operating from an Adult ego state, the preacher respects the listener's autonomy. He avoids the trap of the 'Nurturing Parent' who smothers with easy comfort and the 'Critical Parent' who coerces with shame. The sermon's power lies in its transparency and the refusal to offer the 'Con' of a simple solution, instead pointing to a profound, reality-testing paradox.",

    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'we are all condemned' section could potentially trigger an 'Adapted Child' fear response if not balanced by the preacher's shared vulnerability.",
      "Slightly more 'Free Child' spontaneity could further humanize the high-level intellectual Adult analysis."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' to deconstruct 'Parental' cultural structures. Keep identifying as a fellow traveler to prevent the congregation from casting you in the 'Rescuer' role."
