      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a strong concrete experience by referencing the Boston Marathon bombing, a recognizable and emotionally charged event. However, after the introduction, the sermon shifts rapidly into thematic analysis. While it mentions 'pink slips' and 'bad diagnoses', these remain brief examples rather than immersive narratives that allow the hearer to 'feel' the situation deeply. The experience is more intellectualized than lived-through.",

The preacher pauses to explore the human condition of being 'narcoticized by the force of the present tense.'

The reflection on Psalm 30 as a script for 'calling out' God provides a sophisticated perspective on the problem of divine absence.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a logically rigorous and theologically profound exploration of Christian hope. It successfully integrates multiple biblical texts into a single 'Big Idea'—the tension between the 'Long Game' of God's sovereignty and the 'Short Run' of human action. While it excels in Abstract Conceptualization and Reflective Observation, it is somewhat weaker in Concrete Experience. The opening illustration is effective, but the subsequent examples are often listed rather than narrated, which may limit emotional identification for some hearers. The transition from the theological indicative to the practical imperative is clear and effective, though the 'Active Experimentation' phase remains at a somewhat general, communal level rather than providing specific, individual action steps. Overall, it is a strong 'Assimilating' sermon that provides significant intellectual and visionary food for the congregation.",

    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Strengthen the Concrete Experience by starting with a personal story of 'dismay' rather than a public event.",

      "Experiment with a more Narrative structure where the 'Short Run' challenges are explored through a single character's journey."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a robust example of theological preaching that successfully moves through the Kolb cycle, though it favors the 'Abstract' and 'Reflective' quadrants. Its primary strength lies in its ability to provide a coherent theological framework for understanding hope in a violent world. The diagnosis for improvement is to ground this high-level vision in more immersive concrete experiences and more specific practical applications. It effectively addresses the 'Assimilating' and 'Diverging' learners but could do more to engage the 'Accommodating' learner through narrative and specific trial-oriented tasks. It is a well-crafted, intellectually stimulating sermon that provides a clear 'Homiletic Window' into the biblical text."
