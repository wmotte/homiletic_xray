    "sermon_start_end": "The holiday crowds were gathering in the city of Jerusalem from everywhere. It was close to Passover time. Ships were completely booked from all Mediterranean ports. There were caravans with innumerable swaying camels and foot travelers by the hundreds. [...] Through days of preparation Thy grace has made us strong, And now, O King Eternal, We lift our battle song.",
    "notes": "The sermon uses a classic 'homiletic of the heart' approach, heavily reliant on sensory imagery and historical imagination."

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a strong immersion into the life-world of the biblical narrative. It does not start with a contemporary hook but rather transports the hearer into a concrete historical experience. The use of sensory details—swaying camels, crowded inns, and the visual description of the city—facilitates a high degree of identification. The preacher successfully evokes the emotional atmosphere of 'expectancy' and 'wistful hope.'",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon moves into reflection by analyzing the human condition of the Jerusalem citizens and then pivoting to the congregation. It explores the 'why' of the tragedy: the gap between religious performance and internal reality. However, the analysis remains somewhat binary (religion vs. faith) and lacks a deeper exploration of the complexities of human resistance to God.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Theological depth is present but remains largely implicit or tied to poetic imagery rather than logical formulation. While it references Isaiah and the nature of Christ's kingship, it lacks a rigorous 'big idea' or a clear dogmatic framework. The exegesis is more descriptive than analytical.

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of narrative-visionary preaching that excels in creating an immersive experience for the hearer. It successfully bridges the biblical world and the human heart through vivid imagery and emotional resonance. However, the sermon is imbalanced; it prioritizes 'feeling' and 'seeing' over 'thinking' and 'doing.' The theological conceptualization is somewhat thin, relying on poetic allusion rather than clear exposition. Most significantly, the sermon lacks a concrete pragmatic dimension, leaving the call to action in a state of high-flown metaphor. While it effectively diagnoses the 'problem' of religious superficiality, it offers little in the way of practical guidance for the 'active experimentation' phase of the learning cycle.",

      "Incorporate a 'Pragmatic' section that answers 'How do we do this?'",
      "Use a contemporary analogy to ground the historical narrative.",
      "Formulate a single, clear 'Truth Statement' (Abstract Conceptualization) to anchor the poetic imagery."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a highly effective narrative performance that succeeds in the 'priestly' and 'prophetic' tasks but falls short in the 'sage' and 'servant-leader' tasks. From a Kolb perspective, it provides a rich 'Concrete Experience' and 'Reflective Observation,' making it ideal for 'Diverging' learners. However, the lack of 'Active Experimentation' and the thinness of 'Abstract Conceptualization' prevent it from being a truly holistic learning event. The priority for improvement is to ground the high-level visionary language in the grit of daily ethical practice."
