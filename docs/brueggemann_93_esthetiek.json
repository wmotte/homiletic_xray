    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in 'reframing' abstract theological concepts into concrete social and psychological realities. The 'snares of death' are not left as archaic metaphors but are vividly translated into the 'rat-race of fear' and 'narcoticized' indifference. Brueggemann uses sensory-adjacent language to describe the feeling of being 'boxed in' or 'immobilized.' However, the imagery remains somewhat cerebral—focused on social systems rather than tactile, earthy descriptions of the biblical scenes themselves. While it 'shows' the contemporary condition effectively, it 'tells' the biblical narrative (Jesus on Friday, the table in Luke) with less visual density than the contemporary application.",
      "quotes": [
        "The snares of death are the rat-race of fear and anxiety that keep us always on Orange Alert.",
        "Death is the power of negation... that draws us into despair and that denies us the freedom and the energy and the will to care about the neighborhood.",
        "They are overrun by waves of gratitude that has us on our way rejoicing."

        "Strong translation of 'death' into contemporary psychological and social experiences.",

        "Increase sensory detail in the biblical scenes (e.g., the smell of the bread, the dust of the Emmaus road).",
        "Avoid over-relying on sociological descriptors like 'social systems' or 'ideologies' which can feel abstract.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strong 'showing' in the contemporary diagnosis; more 'telling' in the biblical exposition."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and demonstrates high 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre). The preacher avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by deconstructing terms like 'Eucharist' and 'substitutionary atonement,' offering instead 'generative energy' and 'essential nutrients.' There is a deliberate choice of verbs—'immobilize,' 'negate,' 'skew,' 'unleashed'—that suggests a careful crafting of the text. The preacher acknowledges the difficulty of language ('we only know how to mumble about it'), which adds a layer of honest intellectual humility. The precision lies in the naming of modern malaise (greed, scarcity, coercion) with surgical accuracy.",
      "quotes": [
        "Death is not just the end of life or the funeral... Death is the power of negation before which we find ourselves helpless.",
        "We can, if we are not vigilant, default on any of these three claims.",
        "Seeing now that old enemies are really needy neighbors."

        "Excellent deconstruction of religious clichés into meaningful contemporary equivalents.",

        "Some terms like 'ontological and metaphysical' might still feel like academic jargon to some hearers.",
        "Ensure the 'we' doesn't become a rhetorical generalization that masks individual experience.",
        "The transition between the 'old school' opening and the serious body could be smoother."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "The sermon identifies jargon (substitutionary atonement) and intentionally replaces it with more accessible, yet equally profound, language."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a distinct rhetorical cadence, characterized by the use of triads and parallelisms. The repetition of the three-point structure (snares, rescue, gratitude) acts as a rhythmic anchor. There is a clear 'legato' in the reflective sections about God's goodness and a 'staccato' urgency when describing the snares of death. The use of alliteration ('neighborhood failure... state policy... fearful self-assertion') creates a percussive effect that aids memorability. It is clearly written for the ear, utilizing the 'oral event' quality Immink emphasizes, though it occasionally leans into a lecture-like rhythm in section II.",
      "quotes": [
        "The snares are real and powerful... the surprise of transformation... the gratitude that empowers.",
        "No longer fearful and anxious, no longer immobilized... no longer paralyzed.",
        "Through many toils and snares I have already come."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of repetition and parallel structure to build momentum.",
        "Good variation in sentence length, moving from short claims to longer, descriptive flows.",
        "Strong use of the 'rule of three' which provides a satisfying oral symmetry."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The middle section (II) feels slightly more like a list than a rhythmic movement.",
        "Could use more internal rhyme or assonance to heighten the poetic quality of the 'grace' sections.",
        "The opening anecdote is a bit 'clunky' compared to the poetic depth of the conclusion."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Primarily oral language; the rhythm suggests a spoken performance rather than a dry essay."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high degree of linguistic stewardship. It avoids religious kitsch by translating 'dead' theological metaphors into 'living' social and psychological realities. The imagery is effective, particularly in diagnosing the 'deathly' aspects of modern life, though it remains slightly more conceptual than sensory. The rhythm is well-paced, utilizing rhetorical repetitions that honor the oral nature of preaching. It is the language of a 'witness' (Long) who is carefully choosing words to bridge the gap between ancient text and contemporary anxiety."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry), moving from the 'upsetting' reality of death to the 'resolution' of gratitude. However, the structure is somewhat transparent—the preacher explicitly tells the audience he is following 'three points.' While this provides clarity, it slightly diminishes the 'event' character by making the mechanics of the sermon too visible. The movement from the Psalm to Jesus to Acts creates a sense of historical momentum, but the transition to 'our lives' feels like a secondary application rather than an integrated narrative journey. The energy peaks in the final section, but the 'middle' feels a bit like a theological survey.",
      "quotes": [
        "I line it out this way...",
        "Our work in front of these texts, I imagine, is to make the dangerous contemporary move...",
        "I am the one, today, who gets to invite you back into the drama again."

      "strengths": [
        "Clear movement from 'trouble' to 'grace' (Wilson's Four Pages).",
        "The conclusion successfully resolves the tension introduced at the beginning.",
        "The 'drama' metaphor provides a consistent thread throughout the sermon."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Reduce the 'signposting' (e.g., 'I line it out this way') to allow the narrative to flow more organically.",
        "The 'upsetting of equilibrium' could be more dramatic and less 'didactic' at the start.",
        "Integrate the biblical examples more deeply into the contemporary struggle rather than listing them."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A hybrid of a static three-point structure and a dynamic journey; the 'points' are visible but the movement is real."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest strength. It performs a masterful 'reframing' (Cilliers). It doesn't just apply the text to the context; it uses the text to unmask the context. By defining 'death' as 'Orange Alert' and 'neighborhood failure,' the preacher allows the Psalm to speak directly to the 21st-century hearer's gut. The synthesis of the Emmaus story (Luke) with the contemporary experience of the Eucharist as 'essential nutrients' is organic and surprising. It respects the 'strangeness' of the biblical world while showing its immediate relevance to 'state policy' and 'greed.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The snares of death are all around us, in our rhetoric, in our social systems, in our favorite ideologies.",
        "Old enemies are really needy neighbors, seeing that what looked like scarcity is enough when shared.",
        "This same evangelical drama is being re-performed in our lives."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Masterful 'reframing' of biblical categories for a secularized/anxious context.",
        "The connection between 'scarcity/greed' and 'death' is a profound contextual insight.",
        "The sermon moves beyond individual piety to social and political reality."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection to the 'Acts' passage is the weakest and could be more concretely linked to modern community life.",
        "Ensure the 'we' includes the preacher's own struggle with these 'snares' to avoid a 'teacher-student' dynamic.",
        "The 1 Peter reference at the end feels a bit 'tacked on' rather than integrated."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing present; the sermon changes the 'lens' through which the congregation views their daily anxiety."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward an 'open work of art' (Stark) by inviting the hearer into a 'drama' rather than a 'doctrine.' However, the explicit three-point structure and the somewhat authoritative 'I am the one who gets to invite you' can feel slightly 'closed' or prescriptive. While it avoids moralistic 'happy endings' by acknowledging that the snares are 'real and powerful,' it does provide a very clear, almost tidy, theological map. There is room for the hearer to 'step in,' but the path they are to take is quite clearly marked out. It is more 'polyvalent' in its imagery than in its structural conclusion.",
      "quotes": [
        "I am the one, today, who gets to invite you back into the drama again.",
        "We know that even when we can only mumble about it.",
        "It turns out, it’s not just three points. It is the truth of our lives."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The invitation to 're-perform' the drama allows for individual appropriation.",
        "Acknowledges the difficulty of language and the 'mumbling' of faith.",
        "The ending is an invitation to a table, which is inherently an 'open' liturgical act."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Allow for more 'unresolved' tension—what happens when the 'snares' don't seem to move?",
        "Reduce the authoritative 'signposting' to let the hearer discover the truth themselves.",
        "The conclusion 'overruns' the snares with 'waves of gratitude'—be careful this doesn't become a 'cheap' resolution."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly monovalent in structure but polyvalent in its imagery and application."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is a sophisticated take on the traditional three-point sermon. It moves from a diagnostic 'trouble' to a transformative 'grace,' successfully linking multiple biblical texts into a single 'drama.' The integration of context is superior, using the biblical text as a critical lens on modern life. However, the structural 'scaffolding' is a bit too visible, which occasionally makes the sermon feel more like a brilliant lecture than a spontaneous 'event' of the Holy. It opens space for the hearer but keeps a firm hand on the map."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids the 'pre-chewed emotions' of typical evangelical 'happy endings' by grounding the 'snares of death' in the grit of state policy, violence, and greed. It does not offer 'immediate comfort' but requires a 'walking through the drama.' The preacher specifically rejects 'substitutionary atonement' clichés in favor of more 'authentic' (though perhaps more abstract) descriptions of transformation. The emotion feels authentic because it is tied to the 'pain of suffering' (the neighborhood failure, the narcoticized state).",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The opening mention of 'three points and a poem' (though used ironically to distance itself from kitsch).",
      "The 'waves of gratitude' at the very end borders on a sentimental image, though it is earned by the previous analysis."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of being 'narcoticized about the violence that is all around us.'",
      "The admission that 'we only know [transformation] now, because we see it among us... even when we can only mumble about it.'"
    ],
    "recommendation": "To maintain this depth, continue to ground 'gratitude' in specific, difficult actions (like sharing scarcity) to prevent it from floating into a vague sentiment."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens a significant 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) by reframing the gospel as a 'gift' and a 'surprise' rather than a 'task.' It moves from the 'immobilization' of the law/death to the 'unleashing' of the Spirit. It sustains the tension of living in a world of 'Orange Alert' while claiming a different reality. However, the space is slightly crowded by the preacher's strong rhetorical presence and the clear 'three-point' logic. The mystery of the 'inexplicable' Easter morning is mentioned but then quickly categorized into the 'drama.'",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between 'scarcity' and 'enough' are well-sustained through the metaphor of the table.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery is respected in the 'mumbling' about transformation, but somewhat 'explained' by the sociological analysis.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the 'new life' is presented as a 'release' and 'delight' rather than a heavy 'must.'",
    "recommendation": "Allow for more silence or 'negative capability'—moments where the preacher doesn't have the 'imaginative fashion' ready, but lets the text's strangeness sit."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the 'New Homiletic' with a strong 'Prophetic-Imagistic' flair. Its primary strength lies in its 'reframing'—the ability to take ancient, potentially 'dead' metaphors like the 'snares of death' and make them vibrate with contemporary urgency. The language is precise, avoiding the kitsch of easy sentimentality while maintaining a rhythmic, oral quality that engages the listener. Structurally, it is clear and purposeful, leading the hearer on a journey from the paralysis of modern anxiety to the 'generative energy' of the Eucharist. While the structural 'bones' of the sermon are perhaps too visible, and the biblical exposition occasionally takes a backseat to the brilliant social diagnosis, the sermon successfully creates a 'space for grace' where the gospel is experienced as a transformative event rather than a static truth.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful reframing of 'death' and 'grace' into contemporary social and psychological categories.",
      "High level of language stewardship, avoiding jargon and clichés.",
      "Strong narrative movement from 'trouble' to 'grace' that feels earned, not forced."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduce 'signposting' and structural meta-commentary to increase the 'event' character.",
      "Incorporate more sensory, 'cinematic' detail into the biblical narratives.",
      "Deepen the 'openness' by allowing for more unresolved mystery in the conclusion."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Imagistic / Reframing",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Four Pages/Trouble-Grace balance).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'modern-critical' hearers who are weary of religious clichés but hungry for a faith that speaks to social and psychological reality.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a 'Lowry Loop' structure where the 'clue' to the resolution is more hidden until the turning point.",
      "Use more 'earthy' metaphors (soil, breath, blood) to balance the 'sociological' metaphors (systems, alerts, policies).",
      "Try an 'open ending' that leaves the congregation at the table before the 'waves of gratitude' are fully explained."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A sophisticated, aesthetically 'honest' sermon that does the hard work of translation. It avoids the pitfalls of kitsch and moralism, offering instead a compelling 'drama' that invites participation. It is a model of how to use the 'aesthetic turn' to make the Reformed tradition speak to a culture of anxiety without losing theological depth."
