    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes a central, evocative metaphor: 'the juices of life.' This organic image contrasts sharply with the mechanical 'monopoly' of the empire. However, the imagery remains somewhat limited to the conceptual level of 'power structures' and 'status quo.' While the 'lame beggar' is mentioned, the sensory details of his restoration are secondary to the political implications. The preacher relies on the 'big' vs 'mini' resurrection conceit, which is effective but more structural than sensory. There is a lack of 'painting the scene' in the sense of Paul Scott Wilson’s cinematic approach; we see the power dynamics more clearly than we see the dust of the Roman road or the physical touch of the healing.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise in its intent to 'reframe' (Cilliers) the biblical text into a contemporary socio-political critique. The choice of words like 'collusion,' 'unauthorized,' and 'surveillance' is intentional and sharp. It avoids traditional 'Canaanite' jargon in favor of a modern, slightly academic but accessible vocabulary. However, there is a repetitive use of 'status quo' and 'authorities' which, while emphasizing the point, borders on linguistic monotony. The stewardship of language (McEntyre) is evident in the refusal to use 'churchy' clichés, opting instead for a provocative vocabulary that forces the hearer to see the apostles as 'dissenters' rather than just 'saints.'",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a strong oral cadence, characteristic of the 'prophetic' style. There is a rhythmic use of repetition ('You also are... You also are...') that builds toward the conclusion. The sentence length is varied, with short, declarative bursts ('He mocks the authorities.') punctuating longer, more complex observations. This creates a 'staccato' effect that mirrors the tension of a courtroom scene. It is clearly 'oral language' (Immink) rather than 'paper language.' The rhythm supports the theme of a 'surge of energy,' making the text feel like a living performance rather than a dry lecture.",

    "summary_language": "The language is rhetorically sharp and avoids traditional religious clichés, opting instead for a socio-political 'reframing' that feels contemporary and urgent. While it lacks high-sensory poetic imagery, it excels in rhythmic delivery and the precise use of provocative terminology. The 'micro-aesthetics' serve a prophetic function: to unsettle the hearer by stripping away the 'stained-glass' distance of the biblical story and presenting it as a live political conflict. It is more 'rhetoric' than 'poetry,' but highly effective in its chosen mode."

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear, logical progression: Conflict (Empire vs. Apostles), Action (The Healing), Defense (Peter’s Speech), and Application (The Table). There is a palpable 'upsetting of the equilibrium' in the description of the 'nervous authorities.' However, the 'plot' (Lowry) is somewhat flattened by the early disclosure of the themes. The tension is more intellectual than narrative; we know from the start that the 'Empire' is the antagonist. The movement from 'Big' to 'Mini' resurrection provides a structural backbone, but the 'turning point' is more of a logical conclusion than a dramatic surprise.",
      "quotes": [
        "The authorities... were, we are told, 'amazed' by what they saw and heard.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. It perfectly exemplifies Cilliers' 'reframing.' The Roman Empire is not a historical relic but a 'superpower' concerned with 'money, power, and control.' The healing of the beggar is reframed as 'health care reform' and 'preexisting conditions.' This synthesis is surprising yet feels hermeneutically grounded. It respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the power of the Name) while making it immediately relevant to a modern audience. The integration is organic; the preacher doesn't 'apply' the text at the end, but reads the context *through* the text throughout.",
      "quotes": [
        "local power structure that owed its life and its status to the authority of the empire",

        "Ensure the 'health care' metaphor doesn't become too partisan, which might 'close' the work for some hearers.",

        "Connect the 'Psalm 23' title more explicitly to the 'Acts' content."

      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing. It offers a new frame (Resurrection as subversive life-force) to view the old frame (Empire/Status Quo)."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is rhetorically powerful, it is aesthetically 'closed' (Stark). The categories are binary: the 'Empire' (bad/controlling) vs. the 'Jesus people' (good/life-giving). There is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or the 'resistance' of the hearer who might find themselves working within the 'status quo.' The interpretation is singular and forceful. It approaches the hearer as a 'witness' to be recruited rather than a 'conversation partner' (Stark). The conclusion 'You also are...' is more of a commissioning than an invitation into mystery. It is a 'monovalent' work of art.",
      "quotes": [
        "The authorities who were in charge of money, power, and control",
        "You also are authorized to perform mini-resurrections",

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Closed work of art. It is a powerful, monovalent prophetic call that leaves little room for alternative interpretations of the 'Empire' or the 'Beggar'."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.33,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon is structurally robust, moving from a dramatic biblical scene to a contemporary challenge. Its strength lies in its 'reframing' of the text-context relationship, making the ancient story feel like a current event. However, it suffers from a binary 'closedness' that leaves little room for the complexity of the hearer's life within 'the empire.' It functions more as a prophetic manifesto than an 'open work of art,' prioritizing the 'event' of the call to action over the 'space' for personal reflection."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'cheap comfort' and 'happy endings' by placing the 'mini-resurrections' in the context of jail, surveillance, and conflict. The 'emotion' here is not sentimentality but 'holy indignation' and 'courage.' It does not pretend that everything is easy; it acknowledges the 'nervousness' of power. By using political and economic language, it grounds the 'miracle' in a gritty reality, avoiding the 'pre-chewed' piety of traditional Easter sermons. It sustains the tension between the 'Easter guy' and the 'imperial executioner.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None significant; the sermon avoids the 'Jesus is the sunshine' type of imagery.",
      "The 'health care' metaphor could border on kitsch if it were a simple 'Jesus heals all,' but here it is framed as a subversive act."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the authorities being 'stunned into silence' by a reality that fits none of their categories.",
      "The recognition that the 'Easter guy' was executed as an 'enemy of the state'."

    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'gritty' edge by continuing to ground theological concepts in the friction of real-world power dynamics."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for 'grace' as a subversive, unavailable power ('juices of life') that the empire cannot control. This is a classic Cilliers 'Space for Grace' where the 'Holy happens' outside of human administration. However, the space is partially 'closed' by the moral imperative at the end. When the sermon shifts to 'You also are authorized to perform...', grace risks becoming a human 'task' or 'performance' rather than a gift. The 'mystery' of the resurrection is well-protected from the Empire, but perhaps too easily harnessed by the 'Jesus people.'",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'already' of the Big Resurrection and the 'not yet' of the Empire's control is well-sustained.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'Name' is treated as a mysterious source of power, though its operation is quickly translated into social action.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the description of God's action, but moralization (the call to perform) takes over in the final application.",
    "recommendation": "To create more space, emphasize that 'mini-resurrections' are also something we *receive* and *witness*, not just something we 'perform'."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of 'Prophetic-Reframing' aesthetics. Its primary beauty lies not in poetic decoration but in the 'sober beauty' of a sharp, clear synthesis between the biblical world and the contemporary political landscape. It successfully 'reframes' (Cilliers) the resurrection from a distant dogma into a present, subversive energy. The language is rhythmic and oral, avoiding the pitfalls of 'paper language' and religious kitsch. However, the sermon is aesthetically 'closed' in its binary worldview, leaving little room for the hearer's own ambivalence or for the 'openness' of the work of art (Stark). It is a sermon of 'performance' (Immink) and 'witness' (Long), where the preacher acts as a herald of a counter-reality. While it lacks sensory imagery, its rhetorical precision creates a different kind of aesthetic impact: the 'beauty of the truth' being told to power.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional 'reframing' of the biblical narrative into contemporary socio-political categories.",
      "Strong oral rhythm and cadence that builds toward a liturgical climax.",
      "Complete absence of religious kitsch and sentimentalism."

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Reframing (Sober-Reformed with a political edge)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Thomas Long (The Preacher as Witness).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to socially-conscious, intellectually engaged hearers who are weary of traditional piety and seek a 'gritty' faith.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'open' ending that leaves the hearer with a lingering question.",
      "Incorporate one 'unresolved' story of suffering to deepen the anti-kitsch depth.",
      "Use more concrete, sensory metaphors for the 'Holy Spirit' beyond 'energy'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically effective 'event' that succeeds in its primary goal: to disrupt the hearer's perception of reality. By stripping the text of its 'religious' veneer and exposing its political 'nerves,' the preacher creates a space where the Gospel feels dangerous and alive. While it sacrifices some 'poetic' depth and 'interpretive openness' for the sake of rhetorical clarity and prophetic urgency, it remains a compelling example of how form (the courtroom drama) can serve content (the trial of the Gospel). It is a 6.5/10—a solid, effective work that excels in integration but has room to grow in imagery and polyvalence."
