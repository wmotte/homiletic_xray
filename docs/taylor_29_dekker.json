  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Luke 19:41 as a springboard but quickly dissolves into general biblical motifs (Isaiah, David, Sinai). It fails to identify what is unique to this specific verse that cannot be found elsewhere. The 'weeping' is mentioned but treated as a general symbol of divine sorrow rather than a specific exegetical pivot.",
      "quotes": [
        "The lyrics of Isaiah had moved through their history, the stern forebodings of Jeremiah were their heritage, the bold condemnation of Amos flamed in the national memory."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Isolate the specific 'why' of Jesus' weeping in this pericope. Avoid diluting the text with a 'best of' list of Old Testament characters."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher provides a vivid historical-geographical reconstruction of Jerusalem, which shows some study of the context. However, it remains at the level of 'scenery' rather than theological exposition of the Greek text or the specific Lucan theology of the visitation of God.",
      "quotes": [
        "The blazing bronze doors of the temple stood on the eastern heights of the city. The temple's shining dome blazed in the brilliance of the morning sunlight."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond descriptive scenery to the theological tension within the Lucan text regarding the 'time of visitation' and the specific judicial nature of the weeping."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The application is largely psychological and moralistic, using general categories like 'scheming,' 'dislikes,' and 'lust.' It lacks the concrete cultural and social specificity Dekker demands. It addresses 'man' in a general sense rather than the hearer in their specific zeitgeist.",
      "quotes": [
        "We live by our wits instead of by our faith in him. We live by scheming instead of by his power, by our dislikes rather than by his love."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Replace general moral categories with concrete examples of how the 'city of Mammon' manifests in the current cultural and political moment."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a traditional 'then' and 'now' structure. The first half is historical description; the second half is moral application. The hearer is not 'drawn into the text' so much as told that they are like the people in the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "In experience of the holy, we and citizens of old Jerusalem are indeed one.",
        "Now the King draws near to you and to me..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Integrate the application into the exposition of the text itself so that the 'present of revelation' occurs during the reading of the Word."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Misery is present as religious hypocrisy. Redemption is hinted at in Christ's tears. Gratitude is expressed in the closing hymn. However, the 'misery' feels more like a moral failure than a theological state of being lost before God.",
      "quotes": [
        "They were religionists without being religious, performers but not participants.",
        "Underneath our mask of pious goodness the Lord Christ knows that we reject him."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' from mere hypocrisy to the radical inability of the city to recognize its peace, as the text suggests."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "There is a mention of 'approaching judgment' and 'being lost,' but it is softened by the sentimental imagery of the weeping Jesus. The radical choice between life and destruction is present but lacks the 'sharpness' Dekker requires.",
      "quotes": [
        "his spirit trembles as if hearing the growing thunder of approaching judgment.",
        "you and I ought to fling ourselves recklessly and magnificently in the path behind him."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher must confront the hearer with the possibility of being 'lost in time'—that the moment of grace can actually pass."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the center, and His divinity is implied in the 'heartbreak of the eternal.' The sermon moves toward Him as the telos. However, the grace offered is somewhat syrupy, focusing on 'tender dominion' rather than the radical 'salvation outside oneself.'",
      "quotes": [
        "This is God's sorrow, the heartbreak of the eternal. Ought not this to melt our hearts?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more on Christ as the one who fulfills the judgment we deserve, rather than just a weeping observer of our failures."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "At approximately 1,150 words, the sermon would take about 11-12 minutes to deliver. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for theological depth. It is a 'speech,' not a sermon by his definition.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the theological exposition and the concrete application to meet the minimum 20-minute threshold."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily due to its brevity and its tendency toward generalities. It functions more as a moralistic meditation on religious hypocrisy than a rigorous exposition of Luke 19:41. The exegesis is replaced by historical 'color,' and the application remains in the realm of general truths rather than concrete contemporary reality.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective use of historical geography to set the scene of the pericope.",
      "Clear attempt to link the 'misery' of the biblical audience to the 'misery' of the modern congregation."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (approx. 11 minutes) precludes the necessary depth.",
      "Reliance on general biblical themes instead of the unique contribution of the specific text.",
      "Application is moralistic and lacks concrete cultural/sociological analysis."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is an 'edifying speech' that lacks the required breadth and the specific, concrete 'actualization' of the Word. It fails the formal requirement of duration and the substantive requirement of specificity."
