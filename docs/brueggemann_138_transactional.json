    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust, operating primarily from the Adult ego state. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent (shaming the congregation for not being like Jesus). Instead, it uses a structural analysis of power to invite the listener into a shared reflection. While there is a slight risk of 'Ain't It Awful' regarding modern political systems, the preacher's inclusion of himself in the 'risk-averse' group prevents a position of moral superiority.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To ensure the sermon remains game-free, ensure that the critique of 'empire' leads to specific Adult choices rather than just collective sighing (Ain't It Awful)."
