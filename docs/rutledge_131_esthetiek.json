    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes effective imagery to bridge the gap between abstract eschatology and concrete reality. Rutledge avoids 'dead metaphors' by contrasting the 'white light' clichés of near-death experiences with the 'brain-crunching' reality of a penniless man judging the cosmos. She successfully 'paints the picture' of the judgment scene, not through literalism, but through a list of historical figures (Napoleon, Stalin), making the 'spacious horizon' of the feast day visible. The imagery of 'the old Adam' is revitalized through contemporary examples of social upheaval. While not overly poetic in a flowery sense, the imagery serves the 'optics' of the sermon well, allowing the hearer to see the contradiction of the Crucified Judge.",
      "quotes": [
        "It should make our brains crunch just to think about it.",
        "He will be attended by numberless legions of angels, the heavenly host. He will sit on his throne of glory...",

        "Concrete description of Jesus' poverty vs. his judicial authority."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The imagery of the 'sheep and goats' remains somewhat traditional; more sensory detail of the 'least of these' (smell, touch) could deepen the impact.",
        "The 'white light' metaphor is dismissed quickly; it could be used as a stronger foil for the 'darkness' of the cross.",
        "More 'showing' of the 'small, seemingly insignificant deeds' would balance the 'telling' of the cosmic scene."

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "The sermon leans toward 'telling' the theological significance, but 'shows' effectively through historical and contemporary anecdotes (Robert Hughes, John McCain)."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Rutledge exhibits high stewardship of language. Her word choice is precise, avoiding the 'Canaanite jargon' often found in Reformed-adjacent preaching, or else she revitalizes it (e.g., 'the old Adam'). She makes careful distinctions between 'sentiment' and 'faith,' and between 'moralism' and 'the Gospel.' The language is economical; every paragraph serves a specific theological movement. Her use of the Barbara Pym quote demonstrates an appreciation for literary nuance in describing the human condition. The precision in defining 'Adam' as a collective state of sin rather than just individual 'badness' prevents the sermon from sliding into platitudes.",
      "quotes": [
        "Personal experience is notoriously undependable and intransmissible.",
        "Without him at the center, the teaching deteriorates into moralistic pabulum...",

        "The term 'accoutrements of majesty' might be slightly too academic for some listeners."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "The preacher uses theological terms (Adam, Second Coming, Creed) but defines them through narrative and context, making them accessible without diluting them."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a steady, dignified cadence suitable for an Episcopal liturgy. There is a clear use of parallelism and repetition ('no bank account, no resumé... no title or rank') which builds rhetorical weight. However, it occasionally falls into 'paper language,' particularly in the sections explaining the lectionary cycle or the history of the church year. The rhythm is more intellectual than lyrical. The ending achieves a higher musicality with the rhythmic 'least, the last, and the lost,' but much of the body is structured as a logical argument rather than a poetic movement. It is a text that demands a deliberate, authoritative speaking pace.",
      "quotes": [
        "...a man who owns nothing, who has no bank account, no resumé or portfolio, no job or house, no title or rank...",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The opening paragraph is somewhat bureaucratic/informational, lacking a 'hook' in sound.",
        "Some sections feel like an essay (e.g., the Robert Hughes commentary) and lose the oral 'flow'.",
        "More use of alliteration or assonance in the descriptive passages would enhance the 'musical' experience."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Primarily oral, but with significant 'essay-like' sections that lean toward paper language."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' and intellectual rigor. Rutledge avoids religious kitsch by using precise, often sharp vocabulary that challenges the hearer. While not traditionally 'poetic,' the imagery is intellectually stimulating and the metaphors are fresh. The stewardship of language is evident in the careful definitions of theological concepts. The rhythm is steady and authoritative, though it occasionally sacrifices musicality for the sake of clear, logical exposition. It is a high-quality example of the 'witness' style of preaching, where the word is used with gravity and care."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear dramaturgical movement. It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' through the mocking voice of Robert Hughes ('Jesus didn't show'). This creates a tension: how does the church respond to the silence of God? The plot moves from this skepticism to the 'incredible statement' of Jesus as Judge. The turning point is the realization that the Judge is the Crucified One, shifting the focus from our 'good deeds' to 'being in Christ.' The energy is sustained by moving from the cosmic (nations) to the personal (the 'old Adam' in us). The conclusion provides a resolution that is not a 'happy ending' but a promise of transformation.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus must have been busy when my turn came; he didn’t show.",
        "We need to pause in awe at this contradiction.",
        "At the last judgment, 'Adam' will disappear into outer darkness forever..."

      "strengths": [
        "Strong 'hook' using a contemporary cultural critic.",

      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'Pledge Sunday' section feels like a slight 'dip' in the narrative arc, momentarily breaking the cosmic tension.",
        "The transition between the John McCain story and the Pledge appeal is somewhat abrupt.",
        "The 'upsetting' at the beginning could be more viscerally connected to the congregation's own potential doubts."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey from skepticism to the 'astonishment' of grace, rather than a static three-point sermon."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong point. Rutledge 'reframes' the biblical text (Matt 25) by placing it against the backdrop of modern skepticism (Hughes) and modern suffering (McCain, Kosovo). She respects the 'strangeness' of the text—the 'brain-crunching' claim of Jesus—rather than smoothing it over. The integration of the Old Testament (Ezekiel) and the Epistle (1 Corinthians) feels organic, creating a 'polyphony' of voices that all point toward the central theme of Christ's Lordship. The context of 'Pledge Sunday' is integrated, though perhaps less 'aesthetically' than the other elements, by linking the survival of the 'creed' to the organized church.",
      "quotes": [
        "The intellectual elite is certain to make fun of it.",
        "Books and articles about the Japanese in Nanking... show that the old Adam is right there underneath the surface in all of us.",
        "If the church weren’t organized, there would be no one left to say the creed."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent 'reframing' of the sheep/goats parable as Christology rather than mere ethics.",
        "Honors the 'strangeness' of the Second Coming in a secular age.",
        "Surprising and effective use of secular literature (Pym, Hughes) to illuminate the text."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection to 'Pledge Sunday' could be more 'reframed' as an act of cosmic witness rather than a defense of 'organized religion'.",
        "The mention of 'lifelong Episcopalians' is a bit of an 'insider' comment that slightly narrows the context.",
        "Could explore more deeply *why* the 'intellectual elite' finds the Second Coming funny, to sharpen the reframing."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "The sermon offers a significant new frame: the Last Judgment is not about our moral scorecards, but about the 'Judge judged in our place'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is theologically 'closed' in its conviction but 'open' in its psychological application. By emphasizing that 'there will be surprises for everyone,' Rutledge leaves room for the hearer's own 'unease' and 'trembling.' However, the sermon is quite monovalent in its dogmatic structure; it tells the hearer what to feel ('What we are intended to feel is...'). The ending is a strong proclamation of grace, which 'opens space' for the future, but the path to that grace is strictly defined through the lens of the Creed. It is an 'Open Work' in the sense that it invites the hearer into a mystery that cannot be fully managed, yet it is 'Closed' in its authoritative Episcopal tone.",
      "quotes": [
        "It looks as though there are going to be surprises for everyone.",
        "What we are intended to feel is not intellectual curiosity but the overwhelming majesty...",
        "The person who trembles to think of herself before the judgment seat is closer to the Kingdom..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' through the 'old Adam' concept.",
        "The 'surprise' of the judgment leaves the hearer in a state of healthy uncertainty.",
        "Avoids a 'neat' moralistic resolution."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The preacher occasionally 'tells' the congregation what their emotions should be, which can close space.",
        "The defense of 'organized religion' feels like a closed argument rather than an open invitation.",
        "Could end with a more 'open' question to allow the 'astonishment' to linger."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A 'semi-open' work; it invites mystery but maintains a very strong, authoritative interpretive frame."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is robust, moving from the 'low' point of secular mockery to the 'high' point of cosmic hope. The structure is not a list of points but a developing argument that 'reframes' the biblical text for a modern, skeptical audience. The integration of various biblical and contemporary voices creates a rich, polyphonic texture. While the sermon is authoritative and at times dogmatic, it maintains an 'aesthetic of surprise' that prevents it from becoming a closed moralistic system. The movement from 'Adam' to 'Christ' provides a compelling narrative arc that carries the hearer toward the final promise of grace."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is a masterclass in anti-kitsch. Rutledge explicitly attacks 'religious kitsch'—the 'nice, uplifting sort of near-death experience' and the 'moralistic pabulum' of being 'good for goodness' sake.' She refuses to offer 'immediate comfort' without first establishing the 'terrible words' of judgment and the 'excruciating interrogations' of reality. The emotion is authentic because it is rooted in the 'harrowing' and the 'brain-crunching' rather than the sentimental. By acknowledging the 'old Adam' in Nanking and My Lai, she takes the 'pain of suffering' seriously, ensuring that the final grace is not 'cheap.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'fairy tale' version of Jesus beckoning at the end of a white tunnel.",
      "The 'moralistic pabulum' of 'He knows if you've been bad or good'."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the 'Judge judged in our place'—a profound theological reversal.",
      "The reference to the 'old Adam' in the context of historical atrocities (Nanking, My Lai)."

    "recommendation": "Continue to lean into the 'strangeness' and 'offense' of the gospel to maintain this high level of aesthetic depth."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully opens a 'space for grace' by first clearing the ground of human merit. By deconstructing the idea that we can 'total up our good deeds,' Rutledge creates a vacuum that only God's 'one great deed' can fill. The 'space' is the 'between'—between the 'old Adam' and the 'new Christ.' She sustains the tension of the 'already/not yet' by showing that we are both 'good and bad' until the end. The mystery of God's presence in 'remote concealed places' (McCain's cell) is respected, not explained away. Grace is presented not as a 'happy ending' we achieve, but as a 'refashioning' that happens to us.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'Crucified One' and the 'Cosmic Judge' is maintained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'how' and 'where' of the Second Coming are left as 'awesome spectacles' rather than literalized speculations.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; moralism is explicitly identified as the enemy of the true Gospel.",
    "recommendation": "To further open space, allow for more silence or 'open endings' where the congregation must sit with the 'astonishment' before the final 'Amen'."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically sophisticated 'witness' to the Lordship of Christ. It excels in its 'reframing' of a well-known parable, moving it from the realm of tired moralism into the realm of cosmic Christology. The poetics of language are characterized by a 'sober beauty'—precise, intellectually demanding, and devoid of sentimental kitsch. The dramaturgy is strong, using contemporary skepticism as a foil to highlight the 'brain-crunching' radicality of the Gospel. While the tone is authoritative and the structure occasionally leans toward the academic, the sermon successfully creates a 'space for grace' by insisting on the total insufficiency of human merit. It is a 'high-church' aesthetic that values the 'majesty and solemnity' of the liturgical event while remaining grounded in the 'stench' of human history.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rigorous anti-kitsch stance that protects the gravity of the message.",
      "Sophisticated 'reframing' of the text using contemporary cultural and historical markers.",
      "High stewardship of language, particularly in distinguishing moralism from grace."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The transition to 'Pledge Sunday' is pragmatically necessary but aesthetically jarring.",
      "Occasional 'paper language' in the lectionary/liturgical explanations.",
      "A tendency to 'tell' the audience what to feel rather than letting the images evoke the feeling entirely."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed/Episcopal Witness (Intellectual-Kerygmatic)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Thomas G. Long's 'Preacher as Witness' and Johan Cilliers' 'Reframing.'",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to an educated, perhaps skeptical, congregation that values intellectual honesty and liturgical tradition over emotionalism.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more sensory 'showing' in the descriptions of the 'least of these'.",
      "Try to integrate congregational 'business' (like pledges) more metaphorically into the sermon's narrative arc.",
      "Use more 'open' rhetorical questions to invite the hearer into the 'astonishment' of the text."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Rutledge delivers a sermon of high aesthetic quality that honors the 'spacious horizon' of the liturgical feast. By refusing the easy comforts of religious kitsch and the flat demands of moralism, she allows the 'beauty of simplicity' and the 'power of the cross' to emerge. The sermon is a robust performance of 'reframing,' successfully teaching the congregation to look at their own 'old Adam' and the world's suffering through the lens of the Crucified King. It is an exemplary model of how to maintain theological depth and aesthetic integrity in a secular age."
