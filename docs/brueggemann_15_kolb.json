    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a conceptual provocation rather than a concrete narrative hook. While it eventually grounds itself in 'daily' life, the initial engagement is more intellectual than experiential. The preacher uses lists of human experiences to evoke recognition, but these are summarized categories rather than immersive scenes. The 'feeling' level is addressed through the language of 'threat' and 'risk', though it remains somewhat detached from specific congregational anecdotes.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon is strong in analyzing the human condition, specifically the 'temptations' of modern life. It pauses to ask why we resist transformation and critiques the cultural drive for achievement and technology. It effectively explores the 'problem' of human despair and the seduction of self-help, providing a mirror for the hearer to see their own patterns of resistance.",
      "quotes": [
        "we are endlessly seduced by imagining the glory is to be found in our technology, in our brightness, in our achievement...",

The exegesis of 2 Corinthians is logically woven into the larger biblical narrative of Sinai and Transfiguration.

      "analysis": "The sermon ends with a call to 'ministry,' but this remains largely conceptual. While it defines ministry as 'day-to-day human work,' it lacks specific action steps or a 'how-to' for the congregation. The invitation to 'not lose heart' is an internal disposition rather than a concrete experimentation with the truth in the external world.",

    "overall_kolb_score": 6.2,
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong theological treatise that prioritizes Abstract Conceptualization and Reflective Observation. It falls short in providing a truly grounded Concrete Experience and specific Active Experimentation. The preacher effectively deconstructs cultural idols (Reflective Observation) and builds a robust biblical framework for transformation (Abstract Conceptualization). However, the 'Active Experimentation' phase is treated more as a theological category ('Ministry') than a lived practice. The sermon serves the 'Assimilating' learner well but may leave the 'Converging' learner without practical handles. The language is evocative and visionary, but the lack of a central, relatable human narrative prevents it from reaching the highest scores in the 'Accommodating' quadrant.",

      "Use more 'you' language in the application to move from 'the church' to the 'individual hearer.'"
    ],
    "conclusion": "From a Kolb perspective, this sermon is a high-quality example of 'Assimilating' homiletics. It excels at moving the hearer through deep reflection and theological synthesis. However, it fails to complete a balanced learning cycle because it remains largely in the 'Abstract' hemisphere. The priority for improvement is to ground the high-altitude theology in the 'Concrete' and 'Active' quadrants. While the sermon is intellectually and spiritually stimulating, its impact on the 'Hands' of the congregation is left to chance rather than being strategically facilitated by the homiletical structure."
