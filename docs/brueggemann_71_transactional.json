  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely game-free. It operates primarily from an Adult ego state that respects the listener's agency, while using a Nurturing Parent tone to provide emotional security. By framing faith as a 'decision' rather than a forced 'submission,' the preacher avoids the trap of the Critical Parent. The focus on being 'dazzled' encourages the Free Child's capacity for wonder without descending into the dependency of the Adapted Child.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult appeal regarding the interpretation of the text.",
      "Promotes autonomy by framing faith as a personal decision.",
      "Rejects the Drama Triangle by placing the 'Saving' power outside the preacher-listener dynamic."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The description of those who 'manage for themselves' as 'greedy and hurtful' borders on Critical Parent judgment.",
      "The 'trick' mentioned in the introduction could be perceived as a 'Con' if not followed by the Adult explanation provided."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' to analyze the text's structure, as it keeps the listener engaged as an equal partner in the discovery of meaning. Ensure that the 'Nurturing Parent' voice always points toward the listener's own capacity for 'healthy living' rather than a need for the church's constant intervention."
