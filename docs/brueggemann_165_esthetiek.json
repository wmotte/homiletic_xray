    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The imagery is functional but leans heavily on the biblical narrative's inherent vividness rather than original poetic expansion. The preacher successfully 'paints' the scene of Naaman's arrival with 'horses and chariots' and the 'clatter of importance,' contrasting it with the 'muddy little stream' of the Jordan. However, the sensory engagement is somewhat limited to the visual. The metaphor of the baby and talcum powder is a rare moment of tactile/olfactory imagery that bridges the ancient text to modern domesticity. While it follows Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' in the retelling of the story, the theological application returns quickly to abstract concepts like 'monetizing grace' and 'business models.'",
      "quotes": [
        "He looks in the mirror one day, and sees a speck on his nose and recognizes that he has leprosy.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise and avoids traditional 'Canaanite' jargon, opting instead for a socio-political vocabulary ('political clout,' 'reversal of fortunes,' 'entitled'). This precision serves the 'reframing' of the text. The preacher is careful with word choice, particularly in the dialogue between Gehazi and Elisha, likening it to a parent and a teenager. This makes the ancient ethics accessible. However, the use of terms like 'odd calculus' and 'monetize' borders on academic jargon, which might distance some hearers, though it accurately describes the intended critique of modern capitalism's encroachment on the sacred.",
      "quotes": [
        "He is an extortioner. But the general does not blink at the request.",
        "They both contradict the free gift of Elisha, and they try to monetize the grace of God.",

      "jargon_analysis": "Religious jargon is minimal; instead, the sermon uses modern socio-economic jargon ('business model', 'quid pro quo') to reframe the gospel."

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a strong oral cadence, characterized by short, punchy sentences and effective use of repetition (parallelism). The rhythmic summary in section III ('This is a story of...') acts as a liturgical refrain that aids memorability. There is a clear 'staccato' rhythm in the dialogue sections which heightens the drama. The ending, with its repetitive 'Give it away,' creates a percussive, insistent finish that is typical of prophetic preaching. It is clearly written for the ear, not the eye, avoiding the 'paper language' of complex subordinate clauses.",
      "quotes": [
        "Give it away; it’s free; give it away and be grateful. Give it away, because more healing gifts will be given.",

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Strong oral language; the text feels like a transcript of a living performance."
    },
    "average_score_language": 6.67,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by a 'sober-prophetic' style. It eschews baroque decoration in favor of sharp, contemporary vocabulary that reframes biblical roles. While the visual imagery is largely borrowed from the biblical text, the preacher’s precision in describing social dynamics (entitlement vs. gratitude) creates a clear aesthetic of 'truth-telling.' The rhythm is decidedly oral, utilizing repetition and short clauses to maintain engagement, though it occasionally sacrifices poetic depth for didactic clarity."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The dramaturgy is the sermon's strongest aesthetic feature. It follows a 'Lowry-esque' plot: starting with a familiar story, then 'upsetting the equilibrium' by introducing the older, more complex story of Naaman. The movement is not a static three-point list but a deepening spiral. The introduction of Gehazi in section III serves as a brilliant 'second act' complication that shifts the focus from the 'outsider' to the 'hearer' (the insider). This creates a palpable tension: the hearer who was cheering for Naaman suddenly finds themselves mirrored in the villainous Gehazi. The conclusion provides a resolution that is both a warning and an invitation.",
      "quotes": [
        "But we have not yet come to the amazing part of the story.",
        "But we have not yet come to the telling part of the story.",
        "And he got the leprosy that matched his anxious action."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The 'delayed' introduction of the main antagonist (Gehazi) keeps the narrative energy high.",
        "The use of 'But we have not yet...' acts as a recurring hook that pulls the listener deeper.",
        "The arc from the 'speck on the nose' to 'white as snow' provides a satisfying, if chilling, symmetry."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection to the initial ten lepers story in the beginning is a bit brief; it could be woven more tightly into the climax.",

        "Ensure the 'Shalom' of Elisha is given more weight as the pivot point of grace."

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels at 'reframing' (Cilliers). It takes the ancient story of a Syrian general and reframes it as a critique of modern 'scarcity ideology' and 'business models.' The integration is organic because the preacher finds the 'inter-esse'—the space between the ancient text's concern with 'free grace' and the modern world's obsession with 'quid pro quo.' The 'strangeness' of the text (Naaman’s request to worship Rimmon) is not smoothed over but used to highlight the complexity of living in a compromised world. The synthesis is surprising: leprosy is not just a disease, but a symptom of the 'anxious action' of the insider.",
      "quotes": [
        "The general, Naaman, is like Colin Powell, very close to royal power.",
        "He is trying to persuade the prophet to accept his ambiguous political reality.",
        "God’s goodness is not subject to a “business model.”"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The analogy of Gehazi as a 'teenager' and Elisha as a 'parent' is a brilliant contextual bridge.",
        "Reframing leprosy as the result of 'scarcity' and 'anxiety' is a fresh, aesthetic move.",
        "The sermon respects the 'political' nature of both the ancient and modern worlds."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The list of 'gays, or immigrants, or Muslims' feels a bit like a standard contemporary trope; more specific local context could deepen this.",
        "The jump from the story to 'investing in the common good' could be more narratively supported.",
        "Deepen the 'reframing' of the Jordan River—why do we still prefer our 'Tigris and Euphrates' today?"

      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing; it changes the lens from 'miracle story' to 'critique of religious entitlement'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is narratively 'open' in its exploration of Naaman's compromise, the conclusion leans toward a 'closed' moral imperative. The warning 'don't get leprosy!' is a powerful rhetorical device, but it borders on the prescriptive. However, the acknowledgment of Naaman's 'ambiguous political reality' (worshipping Rimmon while believing in YHWH) provides significant 'space' for the hearer to inhabit their own compromises. It treats the hearer as a 'mature conversation partner' by not demanding a perfect, uncompromised life, but rather a generous heart. Stark’s 'polyvalence' is found in the character of Naaman, less so in the final exhortation.",
      "quotes": [
        "He is trying to persuade the prophet to accept his ambiguous political reality.",
        "And all Elisha says in response to his request is, “Go in peace” (v. 19). Shalom!",
        "Give it away, and don’t get leprosy!"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The treatment of the 'house of Rimmon' allows for the ambivalence of modern existence.",
        "The sermon avoids a 'happy ending' for Gehazi, maintaining the 'trouble' of the text.",
        "The invitation to 'imagine the church' is an open-ended call to creativity."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The final 'Give it away' commands could be softened into invitations to allow more room for the hearer's response.",
        "Explore the 'silence' of the nine lepers more to allow for more interpretive layers.",
        "The 'business model' critique is quite specific; leaving more room for other types of 'insider trouble' would increase polyvalence."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly open, particularly in its handling of political compromise, but closes with a strong moral warning."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is high, driven by a compelling narrative arc that systematically deconstructs the 'insider's' perspective. By delaying the true 'trouble' until the introduction of Gehazi, the preacher creates a sophisticated trap for the hearer, leading to a moment of self-recognition. The integration of text and context is masterful, using 'reframing' to turn an ancient healing into a modern economic and psychological critique. While the ending is rhetorically sharp, it maintains enough mystery regarding the 'peace' of the compromised general to remain an 'open work' for the most part."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It explicitly rejects 'cheap solutions' and the 'happy ending' trope by focusing on the 'trouble' and the 'leprosy' of the insider. It does not offer immediate comfort; instead, it sustains the tension of Naaman’s religious compromise and Gehazi’s greed. The 'talcum powder' image is the only moment that flirts with sentimentality, but it is used to highlight the radical nature of the healing rather than to evoke a 'warm glow.' The sermon avoids the 'kitsch of the easy answer' by acknowledging that the general still has to go back to the house of Rimmon.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'talcum powder' image (borderline, but functional).",
      "The somewhat predictable list of 'outsider' groups (gays, immigrants, Muslims) which can feel like a rhetorical cliché in certain homiletical circles."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The acceptance of Naaman's 'pretend' worship in Syria as an 'ambiguous political reality'.",
      "The chilling conclusion where the 'insider' inherits the disease of the 'outsider'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To further increase depth, explore the 'pain' of Gehazi's transformation—why was he so scared? This would move from a moralistic 'don't be like him' to a deeper, more authentic exploration of human fear."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens a significant 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) by emphasizing the absolute 'freeness' of God's gift. By highlighting Elisha's refusal of payment, it creates a vacuum where human 'quid pro quo' logic fails, leaving only grace. However, the 'space' is slightly constricted at the end by the moralistic warning against leprosy. The most profound 'space' is created in the 'Shalom' given to the compromised Naaman—this is where the 'Holy happens' (Immink) in the midst of messy, political life. The mystery of why God heals a foreign general while the 'insider' servant ends up cursed is respected and sustained.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'faithfulness' and 'political necessity' is beautifully sustained in the Naaman/Rimmon section.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of God's 'free' action that cannot be monetized is the central theme.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the narrative, though moralization appears in the final application.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'Shalom' of the ending to linger longer than the 'Don't get leprosy' warning to ensure the final note is one of grace rather than threat."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'Prophetic-Narrative' preaching. Its primary strength lies in its dramaturgical structure—specifically the 'reframing' of the Naaman story to catch the 'insider' hearer off guard. The language is sober, precise, and decidedly oral, avoiding the pitfalls of religious kitsch and 'paper language.' It successfully moves the hearer from a position of safe observation (the ten lepers) to a position of uncomfortable self-examination (Gehazi), while simultaneously offering a profound 'space for grace' in the character of the compromised but healed general. The aesthetic quality is found not in 'beauty' in the sense of pretty words, but in the 'beauty of truth' and the 'sober beauty' of a gift that cannot be bought. The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long) to a reality that contradicts the 'business model' of the modern world. While the conclusion is slightly more didactic than the narrative sections, the overall impact is one of aesthetic and theological coherence.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful narrative arc and use of the 'Gehazi' twist to reframe the hearer's position.",
      "Authentic avoidance of religious kitsch, particularly regarding the complexity of 'political compromise'.",
      "Strong oral rhythm and precision of language that makes ancient roles contemporary."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Deepen sensory imagery beyond the visual to create a more 'cinematic' experience.",
      "Soften the final moralistic imperatives to allow the 'open work' to breathe more at the conclusion.",
      "Refine the 'modern list' of outsiders to avoid rhetorical clichés."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Narrative / Sober-Reformed",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' of Johan Cilliers and the 'Homiletical Plot' of Eugene Lowry.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to socially conscious, intellectually mature hearers who value narrative depth over emotional manipulation.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'showing' the internal landscape of the characters (e.g., Gehazi's fear) more than 'telling' their motives.",
      "Use more varied metaphors for 'grace' that move beyond the economic/business sphere.",
      "Try an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer with the 'Shalom' of the text."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically successful 'event' that honors the 'aesthetic turn' by making the form of the sermon (the narrative reversal) the primary carrier of its content (the radical freeness of grace). It avoids the 'vertical' coldness of old dialectical theology while also shunning the 'horizontal' superficiality of kitsch. It creates a space where the 'holy happens' through the honest naming of human greed and divine generosity. A score of 7.2 reflects a sermon that is well above average, functioning as a strong example of how narrative can be used for prophetic reframing."
