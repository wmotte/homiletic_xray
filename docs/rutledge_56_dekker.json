When I drive down to visit my mother in Virginia, I always stop there. They used to have a decent number of people in attendance, but last week [...] There is no one who does not play a part, and the mighty works of God continue apace, and each person may at any time be called out of his or her place to give assistance to God’s great enterprise, and the angels rejoice to see the little churches in the wilderness."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses 1 Kings 17 but treats it primarily as a narrative illustration for a broader ecclesiological argument. It fails Dekker's requirement of finding what is in THIS text that can be found NOWHERE else. Instead, it relies on Krummacher’s 19th-century interpretation to bridge the text to the present, rather than extracting a unique, current proclamatory word from the specific Hebrew narrative itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "My character this morning is like many others in that she is given no name.",
        "It’s not possible to talk about the widow without talking about Elijah."
      ],

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The preacher relies on a secondary homiletical source (Krummacher) rather than original exegesis. There is no evidence of engagement with the Hebrew text or the specific religious-historical context of the Omride dynasty beyond generalities. The 'exposition' is largely a retelling of the story mixed with 19th-century pietism.",
      "quotes": [
        "About twenty years ago, I happened to pick up a little paperback book called Elijah the Tishbite. It’s a collection of sermons preached in the nineteenth century by F. W. Krummacher...",

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the American ecclesiastical landscape (mainline vs. evangelical), which aligns with Dekker's demand for knowledge of sociology and the zeitgeist. However, it borders on a 'speech about the church' rather than a direct application of the text's specific word to the hearer's spiritual life.",
      "quotes": [
        "I see several groups of churches: There are the nondenominational fundamentalist churches... There are the old-line Protestants...",

      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is sharply divided. The first half is a narrative retelling/exposition (via Krummacher), and the second half is a sociological analysis of the American church. The 'present of revelation' where text and hearer converge is weak because the transition is signaled as a 'personal word' rather than an organic unfolding of the text.",

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon addresses misery (the drought, the widow's poverty, the church's loss of soul) and redemption (God's provision, the raising of the son). It correctly identifies that misery is 'before God' (the living God who judges). However, the 'gratitude' part is somewhat lost in ecclesiastical advice.",
      "quotes": [
        "She and her son... have reached the last of their meager resources... eat it, and die.",
        "The problem is that we start thinking that this human activity is what drives the engine of the church."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on the 'two ways' by warning that traditions that do not take God seriously 'will disappear.' It identifies a 'temporal loss' (losing the soul of the church). Yet, the ultimate seriousness of the narrow way versus the broad way is muffled by the focus on institutional survival.",
      "quotes": [
        "the Christian Church in this very religious country of ours is in danger of losing its soul.",
        "The living God of Elijah does not seem to be in view."

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the one who honors the widow and as the 'Son' who feeds the five thousand. However, Christ is not the 'telos' (goal) of the sermon in the Barthian/Dekkerian sense. The sermon ends on a note of 'the mighty works of God' and the 'living God' generally, rather than Christ as the specific salvation outside ourselves.",
      "quotes": [
        "the power of the same God who many centuries later will feed five thousand people according to the Word of his Son our Lord.",
        "she is remembered and given honor by Jesus Christ himself."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "At approximately 2100 words, the sermon meets the 20-minute threshold. It attempts 'breadth' by surveying the American religious landscape, though this breadth sometimes comes at the expense of exegetical depth.",
      "improvement_point": "Use the time to go deeper into the text's specificities (Hebrew context) rather than broad sociological categorization."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s ideal primarily by substituting original, rigorous exegesis with the homiletical reflections of a 19th-century preacher (Krummacher). It functions more as a 'speech about the state of the church' than a specific actualization of 1 Kings 17. While it correctly identifies the 'living God' as the subject, it leans toward general truths about church health rather than the concrete, unique word of the pericope.",
    "strengths": [
      "Adequate length (Thesis 8) allowing for a developed argument.",
      "Strong awareness of the zeitgeist and the sociological reality of the hearers (Thesis 3).",
      "Clear identification of the 'Living God' as the primary actor, avoiding pure moralism."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of original linguistic and historical exegesis (Thesis 2).",
      "Sharp separation between narrative retelling and contemporary application (Thesis 4).",
      "The 'specific' word of the text is buried under general ecclesiastical categories."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate speech with theological merit, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense because it fails to recreate the specific Bible passage into a new, current proclamatory word that can be found nowhere else."
