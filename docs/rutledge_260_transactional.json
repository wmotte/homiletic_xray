        "presence_of_coercion": "Medium",
        "analysis": "The CP is present through the quoting of Isaiah's harsh judgments ('polluted garment'). However, the preacher uses 'we' rather than 'you,' sharing the judgment rather than imposing it from above.",

        "analysis": "The care is not 'smothering' because it refuses 'cheap comfort.' It promotes autonomy by asking the listener to face reality rather than providing a quick fix.",

      "presence": "High",
      "analysis": "The preacher operates heavily from the Adult position, processing difficult data (starving children, Pan Am 103, Susan Smith) and acknowledging the lack of easy answers. The listener is treated as a thinking subject capable of bearing 'reality.'",

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The sermon largely avoids games by refusing the 'Rescuer' role. The preacher explicitly states they do not have the answers, which prevents the 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' (ITHY) dynamic."

    "congregation_position": "The congregation is invited to be 'Observers/Watchers' (Adult) rather than Victims.",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It avoids the common 'Parental' trap of religious coercion. By speaking from an Adult position, the preacher validates the listener's reality (fear, doubt, grief) without rushing to a 'Rescuer' payoff. The use of 'we' creates a horizontal transaction that promotes psychological maturity and shared responsibility.",
    "strengths": [
      "High Adult presence and intellectual honesty.",
      "Refusal to play the Rescuer role.",
      "Validation of the 'Free Child's' capacity for awe and astonishment."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Slight 'In-group' superiority (Parental) when comparing the denomination to others.",
      "The 'Wrath of God' imagery could trigger 'Adapted Child' fear in trauma survivors if not carefully contextualized."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' to maintain the Adult-Adult contract. Be wary of the 'Ain't It Awful' game where the congregation finds comfort in the darkness itself rather than the hope of the dawn."
