        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "The preacher critiques the 'addiction to separation' from animals, which is a mild CP stance, but it is framed as a loss of connection rather than a moral failure.",

    "analysis": "The preacher shares a personal reflection and invites the listener into a similar state of 'being' rather than 'doing.' It feels like a horizontal sharing of a spiritual discovery.",
    "ulterior_motives": "Minimal. The social level (talking about a donkey) matches the psychological level (inviting humility).",
    "communicative_purity_score": 9,
    "purity_explanation": "The sermon is remarkably transparent about its own process and the preacher's personal desires.",
    "risk_explanation": "A slight risk of a 'Nurturing Parent' trap where the preacher romanticizes poverty ('through the poor'), which can be an ulterior way of keeping the 'poor' in a specific role."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and largely game-free. It moves away from the traditional 'Critical Parent' pulpit style, instead utilizing a 'Free Child' imagination to invite listeners into a state of authentic 'Demut' (humility) that does not sacrifice 'Stolz' (pride). By identifying with animals and the 'donkey' role, the preacher levels the hierarchy between the pulpit and the pew.",
    "strengths": [

      "The romanticization of 'the poor' and 'animals' can occasionally border on a 'Nurturing Parent' smothering effect.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I-statements' (as seen with the cat/turtle examples) to maintain the Adult-Adult/FC-FC connection and avoid slipping into a 'Rescuer' role for the 'poor'."
