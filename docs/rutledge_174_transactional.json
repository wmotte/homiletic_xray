        "presence": "High",
        "analysis": "The Nurturing Parent is present as a companion in grief, validated by the preacher's own admission of struggle. It promotes autonomy by allowing the listener to sit in their 'dust.'",

    "risk_explanation": "There is a slight risk of a 'Rescuer' dynamic when the preacher provides the 'Who' as the answer to the 'Why', potentially closing the listener's own process of discovery."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon series is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It avoids the common 'Critical Parent' trap of religious discourse. By validating doubt and the 'dust' of human existence, the preacher invites the listener into an Adult-Adult transaction. The preacher does not 'Rescue' the listener from grief with platitudes, nor 'Persecute' them for lack of faith. Instead, the preacher models an integrated ego state where the Adult processes the reality of death while the Nurturing Parent provides a safe space for the Child's fear and wonder.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of Adult-to-Adult transparency regarding doubt.",
      "Rejection of the 'Adapted Child' (blind obedience) model of faith.",
      "Validation of the listener's reality (grief, skepticism)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from 'Why' to 'Who' could be seen as a slight bypass of the Adult's need for logical consistency.",
      "The 'Free Child' element of Easter joy is somewhat overshadowed by the solemnity of the 'Dust' metaphor."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements regarding doubt. Ensure that the 'God who is really God' doesn't become a new 'Critical Parent' figure used to silence the listener's Adult questions."
