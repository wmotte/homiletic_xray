    "summary": "The sermon is intellectually robust but psychologically heavy. It utilizes the 'Critical Parent' to establish theological boundaries and the 'Adapted Child' to evoke awe through fear. While it eventually moves toward 'enjoyment,' the path to that joy is paved with 'body blows' and 'terror.' It risks creating a dependency on the preacher's 'Adult' information to navigate the 'Parental' wrath of the divine.",

      "Heavy reliance on fear-based (CP) motivation.",
      "Framing the congregation as 'drowning' or 'unclean' reinforces a Victim script."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation's Adult ego more frequently. Instead of telling them they 'must' feel awe or 'stand back,' provide the data and allow their Free Child to respond spontaneously to the 'glory' without the threat of 'judgment' for misperception."
