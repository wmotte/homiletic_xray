Instead, it utilizes the 'Adult' to process historical trauma and the 'Nurturing Parent' to provide a sense of identity and worth. By highlighting the 'Free Child's' creativity in the slave spirituals, the preacher empowers the listener's own sense of agency. The call to action is grounded in reality-testing (Adult) rather than religious fantasy.",

      "The transition from historical analysis to the 'oughts' of community funding could be softened to maintain the Adult-Adult flow.",
      "Ensure the 'musts' don't trigger the 'Adapted Child's' rebellion in younger listeners."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' instead of 'you' when critiquing history to maintain a shared Adult space. Keep providing concrete 'Adult' examples of success (the schools, the dining facilities) to prevent the sermon from becoming an abstract 'Parental' lecture."
