    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon employs imagery primarily through the lens of biblical quotation rather than original descriptive prose. It effectively utilizes the 'Cry of Dereliction' as a central auditory image. While it mentions 'the stench of the world' (via quote) and 'dregs of abandonment,' the preacher often relies on abstract theological terms like 'enormity,' 'gravity,' and 'significance' to explain the images. The imagery is most potent when describing the disciples 'poring over' texts or the 'soul-destroying' moment on the cross. However, it lacks the 'cinematic' quality advocated by Paul Scott Wilson; it tells the meaning of the image more than it shows the scene itself. The metaphors are traditional (the 'burden' of sin, 'drinking the dregs'), which provides clarity but lacks the 'estrangement' Cilliers suggests is necessary for a fresh perception of grace.",

There is a clear stewardship of words, avoiding excessive 'Canaanite' jargon while respecting the weight of theological categories. The preacher is precise about the 'strangeness' of the Pauline formulation in 2 Corinthians 5:21, acknowledging the 'depths upon depths.' The use of 'derelict' and 'criminal scum' provides a sharp, un-sanitized precision to the social reality of the cross. However, some phrases like 'human nature being what it is' are slightly clichéd. The preacher’s admission of 'inadequacy' to the task adds a layer of rhetorical humility that aligns with McEntyre’s 'loving language'—it respects the magnitude of the subject matter without claiming to exhaust it.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a steady, meditative cadence appropriate for a Good Friday service. It uses rhetorical questions ('Wouldn't that blow your mind?') to break the rhythm and engage the hearer. There is a effective use of parallelism in the final paragraph ('The voice of the speaker... was the voice of a human being. It was my voice, your voice'). However, the middle sections are somewhat 'paper-heavy,' with longer, explanatory sentences that lack the staccato energy of oral performance. The rhythm is largely didactic rather than poetic. It lacks the 'musicality' of alliteration or assonance that would make the phrases 'stick' beyond the moment of delivery, with the exception of the very final crescendo.",

    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by a 'sober beauty' and theological precision. While it lacks the vivid, cinematic imagery of the 'New Homiletic,' it succeeds in its stewardship of language by treating the biblical text with immense respect. The imagery is largely derivative of the Psalms, which ensures theological grounding but limits original aesthetic impact. The rhythm is meditative and suitable for its liturgical context, though it occasionally slips into a didactic tone that feels more like a lecture than a performance. It is a 'word-centered' aesthetic that prioritizes clarity over sensory experience."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' as described by Lowry. It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium'—challenging the hearer's desire to skip to the 'happy ending' of Easter. It introduces a 'complication': how can the Son of God be a 'derelict'? The movement through the Psalms acts as a journey of discovery. The 'turning point' is the introduction of 2 Corinthians 5:21, which provides the 'key' to the mystery. The energy is sustained by the shift from the disciples' perspective to the hearer's own 'intolerable burden.' The conclusion offers a resolution that is not 'cheap' because it forces the hearer to pass through the 'soul-destroying' moment of the cross before reaching the 'righteousness of God.'",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. It perfectly exemplifies Cilliers' 'reframing.' It takes the 'fixed frame' of the cross as a 'horrible mistake' or a 'nightmare' and reframes it through the Psalms as 'God's plan.' It then reframes the hearer's own experience of anger or despair (via Psalm 88) as something God is 'there ahead of us' in. The synthesis between the ancient Jewish prayer book and the modern person who 'cannot pray' is organic and profound. The preacher respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the Cry of Dereliction) without smoothing it over, allowing the text to speak into the context of human 'selfishness' and 'intolerable burdens' with surprising force.",
      "quotes": [
        "Imagine the disciples returning to the Psalms... and discovering that the Crucifixion is right there in them.",
        "I often recommend [Psalm 88] to people who are so angry at God that they cannot pray.",

        "Could include a more specific contemporary 'contextual' example of an 'intolerable burden' to sharpen the reframing.",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is aesthetically rich, it leans toward a 'closed' system. It functions more as an 'explanation' of a mystery than an 'invitation' into one. The preacher 'pondered these words for many years' and now provides the 'key.' This risks making the hearer a passive recipient of the preacher's discovery. Stark’s 'polyvalence' is limited here; the interpretation of the Cry of Dereliction is quite specific and dogmatically sealed (substitutionary atonement). There is little room for the hearer to find other meanings in the 'dereliction.' However, the mention of the upcoming Psalm reading at the end provides a liturgical 'openness' that allows the hearer to step into the experience themselves.",
      "quotes": [
        "Here, we find a key to the Cry of Dereliction.",
        "Now perhaps we can see.",
        "At the very end of this service we will be reading Psalm 22 together."

      "strengths": [
        "The liturgical 'bookending' (mentioning the Psalm reading at the start and end) creates a space for the hearer's own experience.",
        "The acknowledgement of 'depths upon depths' suggests that the preacher hasn't exhausted the mystery.",
        "The use of 'Imagine yourself' invites the hearer to participate in the narrative."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Avoid phrases like 'the key' or 'now we can see,' which suggest a closed puzzle has been solved.",

        "Allow for the 'ambivalence' of the Cry of Dereliction to linger longer before providing the Pauline resolution."

    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon's structure is its most effective aesthetic component, particularly in its ability to 'reframe' the biblical text for the hearer. It follows a compelling narrative arc that moves from historical discovery to personal appropriation. The integration of text and context is masterful, especially in the use of the Psalms to validate human despair. However, the sermon is somewhat 'closed'—it seeks to explain the mystery of the cross with a 'key' rather than leaving the hearer in the 'open space' of the event. It is a journey that knows exactly where it is going."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It explicitly warns against the 'happy ending' and the temptation to 'set aside the terrible thing.' By focusing on the 'derelict' and 'criminal scum,' the preacher avoids the 'pre-chewed emotions' of sentimental Good Friday piety. The treatment of Psalm 88—'not a word of comfort or encouragement'—is the antithesis of kitsch. It takes the 'pain of suffering' seriously. The only slight risk of kitsch is in the 'unrivalled love' language at the end, but this is tempered by the preceding 'soul-destroying' imagery. It is an authentic aesthetic encounter with the 'Holy' as something terrifying and profound.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The phrase 'unrivalled love' is slightly clichéd, though contextually earned.",
      "The 'happy ending' mentioned at the start is the kitsch the preacher successfully avoids."

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens a significant 'space for grace' by placing God 'there ahead of us' in the darkness. It avoids the 'kitsch' of immediate comfort and instead creates a space where 'abandonment' and 'grace' coexist. However, the space is slightly narrowed by the heavy emphasis on the 'guilt offering' and the 'price paid,' which can feel more like a legal transaction than a space of mystery. Cilliers' 'inter-esse' is present in the tension between the 'already' of the Resurrection and the 'not yet' of the cross's agony. The sermon successfully sustains the tension of the Cry of Dereliction for a long time before offering the 'grace' of 2 Corinthians 5:21.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension of God's absence is sustained through the analysis of Psalm 22 and 88.",
    "mystery_respected": "Partially; the preacher admits inadequacy but then proceeds to provide a very specific 'key' to the mystery.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. There is almost no moralization ('we must'); the focus is entirely on what 'God made' and what 'Jesus took.'",
    "recommendation": "To create more space, allow the 'silence' of God in Psalm 88 to stand on its own for a moment longer without the immediate 'explanation' of Paul's letters."

    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.7,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of 'Sober-Reformed' aesthetics, where the beauty lies in the clarity of the Word and the radicality of the 'reframing.' It eschews the visual and emotional excess of 'kitsch' in favor of a profound, text-driven encounter with the 'God-forsakenness' of the cross. Its primary aesthetic power comes from its 'dramaturgy of discovery'—taking the hearer on a journey through the Psalms to see the Crucifixion with 'completely new eyes.' While the language is more didactic than poetic, it possesses a 'stewardship of language' that treats the mystery of the atonement with the gravity it deserves. The sermon is aesthetically successful because it refuses to resolve the 'trouble' of the cross too quickly, forcing the hearer to stand in the 'space' between the cry of despair and the promise of righteousness.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the Cry of Dereliction through the lens of the Psalms.",

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Reframing-Analytical",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (for the reframing and anti-kitsch stance) and Thomas Long (for the 'preacher as witness' to the text).",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who value intellectual depth, biblical grounding, and an honest, non-sentimental approach to faith and suffering.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'sensory' language to describe biblical scenes (Wilson's 'Show, don't tell').",
      "End with an open question or a 'contemplative silence' to increase the 'open work' quality.",
      "Use more rhetorical figures (alliteration, parallelism) to make key theological points more 'sticky' for the ear."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically 'good' to 'strong' (6.7) piece of homiletic work. It excels in its 'macro-aesthetics'—the way it structures the encounter between the ancient text and the modern soul. It fails to reach the 'exceptional' level (8+) primarily due to its didactic tone and its tendency to 'close' the mystery with theological explanations. However, as a meditation for Good Friday, its refusal of kitsch and its opening of a 'space for grace' within the dregs of despair make it a powerful and effective performance of the Gospel."
