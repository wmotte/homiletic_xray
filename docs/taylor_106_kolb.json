Many that day, we can safely believe, saw and believed; and, while they were afraid to speak, their hearts were turned toward God's throne. [...] There is a God who rules above, With hand of power and heart of love. If I am right, he'll fight my battle. I shall have peace some day.",

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon attempts to facilitate concrete experience by grounding the biblical narrative in the immediate physical and social context of Montgomery. However, it remains somewhat distant by using poetic language rather than specific, lived-out anecdotes. It relies on the hearer's existing emotional investment in the struggle rather than building a new concrete scene.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This phase is well-developed through the exploration of the 'world's conscience.' The preacher pauses to analyze the internal state of both the oppressors and the oppressed, asking 'why' the struggle matters on a spiritual level. It moves from the event to the meaning of the event.",

      "analysis": "The sermon provides a clear theological framework, linking the Resurrection to the 'reversal of all the world's verdicts.'

      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While there is a strong call to 'take heart' and remain committed, the sermon lacks specific, concrete action steps. It functions more as an encouragement to persist in an existing action (the boycott) rather than inviting a new or specific ethical response.",

It falls short in providing concrete 'Active Experimentation,' relying instead on the congregation's existing involvement in the Montgomery movement. It effectively links the local struggle to the cosmic narrative of the Resurrection, providing a strong theological framework for suffering. However, the language is often highly formal and abstract, which may create distance for some hearers. The sermon succeeds in 'Reflective Observation' by interpreting the social movement as a spiritual event, but it lacks the pragmatic 'how-to' that would complete the Kolb cycle for all learning styles.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a strong example of 'Visionary' preaching that provides significant theological and emotional support to a community in crisis. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon—strong on reflection and conceptualization but weak on concrete application. It functions more as a liturgical 'encouragement' than a holistic 'learning' event. While it masterfully interprets the 'why' of the situation (Osmer's Interpretive task), it leaves the 'how' (Osmer's Pragmatic task) largely to the hearer's intuition. For a congregation already in action, this may suffice, but as a standalone piece of experiential learning, it remains incomplete."
