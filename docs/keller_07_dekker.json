    "sermon_start_end": "We’ve been looking in these weeks after Easter at what it means to live the Christian life in the books of 1 and 2 Peter. Today we again come to one of those themes that is crucial to understand what it means to live a Christian life. [...] The whole world has become the place of the glory of God, which means the building block that was rejected became the cornerstone of a whole new world. Don’t you want to be part of that? I do. Let us pray."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon stays close to the imagery of 1 Peter 2 (stones, temple, priesthood). However, it tends to drift into a 'biblical theology of presence' (Eden to Sinai to Zechariah) rather than mining what is unique only to this pericope. It treats the text as a representative of a general biblical idea rather than a singular word.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let me give you a summary of the entire storyline of the Bible in terms of one theme: the presence of God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more on the specific tension in the text between the 'rejected' stone and the 'chosen' stone, and how that specific dialectic defines the church's existence, rather than summarizing the whole Bible."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher shows awareness of the Greek (mentioning the word for 'fitted together' and 'precious'), but the exegesis is subordinated to a systematic-theological framework. The historical context of the 'diaspora' readers of 1 Peter is largely ignored in favor of a general 'Old Testament vs. New Testament' contrast.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s a word that means to be fit together like living stones",
        "That word precious is a powerful word, especially in Greek."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the specific social and religious situation of the first-century 'exiles' to whom Peter wrote, to ground the 'priesthood' in their actual historical marginalization."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding church life (Redeemer's transition to multiple sites) and individual identity (race, profession). It avoids mere generalities by challenging the 'consumer' mentality of large church attendees.",
      "quotes": [
        "Redeemer is at a stage in its own history that we have to consider this.",
        "You’re a Christian first and you’re Asian or Hispanic or African second."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the application by addressing the 'zeitgeist' of individualism more critically, showing how the 'living stone' identity specifically contradicts modern self-actualization."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a very traditional 'three-point' structure (What, Do, How). This separates exposition (the history of the temple) from application (what you should do). The hearer is not 'expounded' within the text, but rather taught about the text and then told what to do with it.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let’s break that down. I want to unpack that. Let’s do it under these three headings..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Abandon the 'unpacking' structure. Allow the application to emerge directly from the movement of the text's own logic so that the 'present of revelation' is felt throughout."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The three parts are present in the background. Misery is defined as the loss of God's presence; redemption as Christ the cornerstone; gratitude as 'output' or ministry. However, the 'misery' feels somewhat abstract/theological rather than a psychological reality the hearer is currently suffering.",
      "quotes": [
        "When we turned away from God... now the very thing we were built for we can’t bear.",
        "If you are only doing input... it’s bad for you."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'misery' of being a 'rejected stone' more palpable. Connect the human experience of rejection to Christ's rejection more viscerally."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon mentions the 'stumbling' of those who disobey, but it quickly moves to the positive 'chosen' status. The seriousness of being 'lost in time' (failing one's calling) is addressed, but the ultimate weight of the 'two ways' feels secondary to the encouraging tone of the sermon.",
      "quotes": [
        "They stumble because they disobey the message—which is also what they were destined for.",
        "If you’re too busy or too timid... it’s bad for you. It’s bad for the church."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher should more sharply articulate the consequence of 'stumbling' on the cornerstone, making the choice of 'life design' more urgent."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "This is the strongest point. Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon moves toward the 'rejected' and 'precious' Christ as the only source of power. The doctrine of the two natures is implicit in the 'living stone' (divine/human) imagery.",
      "quotes": [
        "He was rejected by his Father... because you were precious to him.",
        "Jesus Christ is the priest to end all priests and he’s the sacrifice to end all sacrifices."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure that the 'priesthood of all believers' doesn't become a new law, but remains strictly a 'spiritual sacrifice' enabled by the one Lord."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At approximately 3,400 words, the sermon is well over the 20-minute threshold. It allows for the 'breadth' Miskotte demands, covering significant biblical-theological ground.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the length is used for deeper 'exposition' of the specific text rather than broad 'thematic' surveys of the whole Bible."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong piece of teaching but falls short of Dekker's ideal of a 'recreated, current, proclamatory word' that finds what is unique to this specific passage. It relies heavily on a systematic 'storyline of the Bible' framework which, while informative, tends to flatten the specific contours of 1 Peter 2 into general truths about God's presence. The structure is overly formal (three points), which hinders the interwovenness of exposition and application.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christocentric focus where Christ is the telos and source of grace.",
      "Adequate length that allows for theological depth and 'breadth'.",
      "Concrete application to the specific congregational context and modern identity politics."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Thematic preaching: It treats the text as a hook for the theme of 'presence' rather than an irreplaceable word.",
      "Separation of exposition and application: The 'unpacking' method creates a distance between the text and the hearer's current reality.",
      "Weak sense of the 'two ways': The danger of stumbling is mentioned but not given the existential weight Dekker requires."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate and theologically sound sermon, but it functions more as a 'teaching lecture' on biblical themes than a 'proclamatory event' where the specific text 'expounds' the hearer. It meets the formal requirements of length and Christological focus, but lacks the specific 'nowhere else in the Bible' sharpness Dekker demands."
