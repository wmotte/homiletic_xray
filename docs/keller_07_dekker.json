Today we again come to one of those themes that is crucial to understand what it means to live a Christian life. [...] The whole world has become the place of the glory of God, which means the building block that was rejected became the cornerstone of a whole new world. Don’t you want to be part of that? I do. Let us pray."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon stays close to the imagery of 1 Peter 2. However, it tends to drift into a general 'storyline of the Bible' rather than isolating what is unique to this specific text. The focus on the 'presence of God' is a biblical-theological theme that could be preached from many texts, though the 'living stones' metaphor is adequately handled.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let me give you a summary of the entire storyline of the Bible in terms of one theme: the presence of God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the specific 'haecceity' of 1 Peter 2:4-10. What does the 'spiritual house' say about the church that Ephesians 2 or 1 Corinthians 3 does not?"
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher shows awareness of the Greek ('fitted together') and the cultic background of Israel (tabernacle, Shekinah). However, the exegesis is quickly subsumed by a systematic-theological framework (presence of God) rather than a rigorous historical-grammatical exposition of Peter's specific situation.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s a word that means to be fit together like living stones",
        "In the center of the tabernacle, there permanently dwelt the presence of God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the historical context of the 'diaspora' readers of Peter to explain why the 'temple' imagery was specifically urgent for these 'exiles'."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part. It addresses the 'zeitgeist' of individualism and the specific transition of the local church (Redeemer) from a centralized model to a neighborhood model. It challenges the 'consumer' attitude of modern city dwellers.",
      "quotes": [
        "You stay out of church... say, 'God, change me in the privacy of my own apartment, please.'",
        "Redeemer in the past has been one big central church... largely built around the big show."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the general 'medicine' illustration which is a homiletic cliché; replace it with a more concrete cultural-philosophical analysis of contemporary identity markers."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a very traditional 'three-point' structure: what we are, what we do, how we are enabled. This creates a separation where the text is first 'unpacked' and then 'applied', rather than the hearer being drawn into the text in one movement as Dekker requires.",
      "quotes": [
        "Let’s break that down. I want to unpack that. Let’s do it under these three headings..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Abandon the 'unpacking' meta-language. Allow the application to emerge directly from the movement of the text's logic rather than categorizing it into points."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The three parts are present in the background. Misery is defined as the inability to bear God's presence; redemption as Christ the cornerstone; gratitude as the 'output' of the priesthood. However, 'misery' feels somewhat abstract and 'redemption' is heavily focused on the individual's identity.",
      "quotes": [
        "We don’t want the presence of God and we can’t bear the presence of God",
        "If you are only doing input... it’s bad for you. It’s bad for the church."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Sharpen the 'misery' by connecting it to the 'stumbling' mentioned in the text (v. 8), making it more than just a lack of presence but an active disobedience."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher mentions 'stumbling' and 'disobeying', but the 'two ways' (life vs. destruction) are softened. The focus is more on 'missing out' on church community than on the ultimate seriousness of being lost in the sense Dekker emphasizes.",
      "quotes": [
        "They stumble because they disobey the message",
        "If you’re too busy... it’s bad for you. It’s bad for the church."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The 'stumbling' in verse 8 should be treated with more gravity. Address the reality of 'destruction' (v. 8) as a genuine possibility for those who reject the Stone."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon moves toward the 'rejected Stone' as the source of power. The doctrine of the two natures is implicit in the discussion of the 'living Stone' who is both humanly rejected and divinely chosen.",
      "quotes": [
        "He was rejected by his friends. He was rejected by his Father... because you were precious to him."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'preciousness' of Christ is not merely a psychological feeling but a theological reality based on His objective work."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At over 3,000 words, the sermon provides the 'breadth' Miskotte and Dekker demand. It allows for the development of complex themes like the history of the temple and the psychology of identity.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "None on length; the duration is adequate for the depth attempted."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a clear and effective piece of teaching that functions well as a 'lecture-sermon' but falls short of Dekker's ideal of 'actualizing the Word'. It relies heavily on a systematic-theological framework (the 'presence of God' theme) which tends to flatten the specific contours of the Petrine text. While the application to the local church context is concrete and sharp, the formal structure (exposition then application) prevents the 'present of revelation' from fully manifesting.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong contemporary application regarding the 'consumer' vs 'participant' role in the church.",
      "Adequate length that allows for biblical-theological connections.",
      "Clear Christocentric focus in the final movement."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Separation of exposition and application into a rigid three-point structure.",
      "Over-reliance on general biblical-theological themes rather than the 'nowhere else' of the specific text.",
      "Softening of the 'two ways' and the reality of being lost."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'satisfactory to good' sermon (Score: 6/10). It functions as a competent 'bicycle mechanic' mounting the wheel, but it lacks the 'recreative' power of a sermon where the text and the hearer's world are mixed in a single, urgent movement."
