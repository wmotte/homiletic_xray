      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The 'Sache' is framed through the lens of Liberation Theology. The preacher provides a clear, albeit narrow, exegetical framework by linking the Lukan text to its historical and socio-political context (Soweto, Latin America). The theological depth is found in the rejection of a 'class-neutral' exegesis. However, from a Barthian perspective, the 'Sache' (Christ) is dangerously close to being subsumed by the 'Cause' (Social Justice). The data provided is more sociological and historical than strictly biblical-exegetical. The clarity is high, but the abstraction level of 'bourgeoisie' and 'inter-classicist exegesis' may alienate a lay congregation not versed in Marxist-theological terminology.",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a high degree of political commitment and intellectual rigor. There is little 'vulnerable' self-revelation; instead, the 'I' appears as a teacher and a provocateur. The preacher identifies with the 'rich' ('uns, den Reichen'), yet speaks from a position of moral and intellectual superiority over the 'bourgeoisie'. There is an unintentional 'leak' of severity and perhaps a lack of pastoral warmth. The authenticity is found in the preacher's refusal to offer easy comfort, showing a person who values truth and justice over social harmony.",

      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher to Student' or 'Judge to Accused'. The preacher uses 'we' ('uns'), but it often feels like a rhetorical 'we' that includes the congregation in a collective guilt. There is significant 'relationship noise': the aggressive tone against the 'bourgeoisie' and 'normal exegesis' may make the listener feel attacked or patronized. The preacher defines the congregation primarily by their economic status ('the rich'), which is a reductionist view of the person. The non-verbal charge is one of confrontation.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward the 'Red Side' (Appeal). The ratio between Zuspruch (Promise) and Anspruch (Demand) is skewed. The promise of the Gospel is made conditional: it only applies *if* the listener becomes solidary with the poor. This turns the Gospel into a Law (Anspruch). While the preacher intends to prevent the 'theft' of the promise by the rich, the result is a sermon that functions as a moral and political imperative. The 'healing' aspect of the Gospel is deferred until the political conditions are met.",

    "overall_communication_score": 5.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is a sharp, ideologically consistent example of political homiletics. It succeeds in contextualizing the biblical text within the struggles of the Third World, effectively disrupting a 'cheap' universalism. However, from a Schulz von Thun perspective, it suffers from an over-dominant Appeal side and significant Relationship noise. Theologically, it leans heavily on the 'Law' (Anspruch). The promise of God is conditioned upon human solidarity, which contradicts the Barthian 'Extra Nos' of grace. The preacher acts as a political instructor, which may mobilize the 'Appeal Ear' but risks alienating the 'Relationship Ear' and starving the 'Factual Ear' of the living Christ as the Subject of the action. The sermon is more a lecture on theological ethics than a proclamation of the Gospel.",
    "barthian_warning": "High psychologization and sociologization. God is no longer the 'Acting Subject' but is identified with a specific political movement. The 'revelation' is pinned down to human socio-economic experience.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Intellectual honesty and lack of clichés.",
      "Powerful socio-political contextualization.",
      "Courageous confrontation of the 'rich' congregation."

      "Restore the priority of 'Zuspruch' (Promise) over 'Anspruch' (Demand).",
      "Reduce ideological jargon to improve relational connection.",
      "Focus on the 'Acting Subject' (Christ) rather than the 'Class Struggle'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A rhetorically strong but homiletically unbalanced sermon that sacrifices the freedom of the Gospel for the necessity of the political struggle."
