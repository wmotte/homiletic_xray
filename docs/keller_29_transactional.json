    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is intellectually stimulating (Adult) but psychologically coercive (Critical Parent). It uses a 'Bait and Switch' game where it validates the listener's experience only to pathologize it as a 'deadly' condition. While the move toward 'love' is positive, the methodology relies on making the listener feel 'bad enough' to accept the solution, which can foster a shame-based identity rather than an autonomous one.",

      "Heavy reliance on the 'sin as a predatory animal/tumor' metaphor creates a fear-based Adapted Child response.",
      "The explicit admission that his 'job' is to make people feel bad is a hallmark of the Persecutor role in the Drama Triangle."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the listener's Adult ego throughout the entire sermon. Instead of aiming to make them 'feel bad enough,' invite them to observe the consequences of envy as a reality-testing exercise. Allow the 'Free Child' to experience the beauty of Jonathan's sacrifice without the prerequisite of induced shame."
