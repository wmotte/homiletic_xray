    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon starts with an engaging, Adult-level intellectual curiosity but quickly descends into a Parent-Child dynamic. While the metaphors are creative (Free Child), they are used to reinforce a high-pressure 'Critical Parent' theology where the listener is made responsible for the eternal fate of others. This creates a psychological 'bind' where the 'Good News' of the 'Down Payment' is overshadowed by the 'Will Call' debt of performance.",

      "Reduction of shaming language ('unsmart', 'unworthy').",
      "Softening the 'Persecutor' stance regarding the responsibility of the laity."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to maintain an Adult-Adult transaction by presenting the 'responsibility' as an invitation to partnership rather than a heavy burden that determines the 'eternal destiny' of others. Avoid calling the audience 'unsmart' even in a joking manner, as it reinforces a 'You're Not OK' position."
