        "analysis": "The preacher avoids direct moralizing commands ('you must do X'). Instead, the CP is projected onto 'the world' or 'elites' who judge converts. However, there is a subtle CP use in labeling the audience as 'nice people' in contrast to 'new men'.",

    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This is a remarkably healthy sermon from a TA perspective. The preacher maintains an Adult ego state, using logic and historical context to invite the congregation into a similar state of reflection. He identifies his own membership in the 'elite/nice' group, preventing a Persecutor/Victim dynamic. By framing the Holy Spirit as a 'Defense Attorney' (Paraclete), he provides an Adult framework for the concept of Grace, moving it away from Child-like magical thinking toward a robust psychological reality of 'no condemnation.'",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Advocate' metaphor as it empowers the listener's Adult ego to negotiate with their internal Critical Parent (Conscience/Law)."
