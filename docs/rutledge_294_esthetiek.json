    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in contrasting 'kitsch' imagery (bunnies, butterflies) with stark biblical realism. Rutledge uses sensory details like 'bare branches' and 'the stench of the grave' (implied through the 'furrows') to ground the theology. The imagery of the women 'grabbing up their skirts' creates a cinematic 'show, don't tell' effect that aligns with Paul Scott Wilson’s criteria. However, some metaphors remain slightly traditional (light, harvest), preventing a higher score.",

        "All the cards had flowers, bunnies, and butterflies on them.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Rutledge exhibits high 'stewardship of language' as defined by McEntyre. She carefully distinguishes between 'renewal' and 'resurrection,' refusing to let theological terms slide into vague sentimentality. The language is precise, hitting the 'core' of the Marcan text. She avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by explaining why specific creedal phrases (resurrection of the body) matter compared to cultural clichés (immortality of the soul).",
      "quotes": [
        "Renewal, revival, rebirth — these are the wrong words.",
        "Belief in life after death is so commonplace as to be meaningless.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a clear oral cadence, utilizing rhetorical repetitions ('We hear of...', 'Is it possible...') to build momentum. The rhythm shifts effectively between the staccato of the women’s flight and the legato of theological reflection. It avoids 'paper language' by maintaining a conversational yet authoritative tone, though it lacks the high poetic lyricism that would warrant a 9.",
      "quotes": [
        "Trembling and bewildered … they said nothing to anyone because they were afraid.",
        "He is not in nature, he is not in the ground, he is not in the trees, he is not in the sap rising.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' that rejects aestheticism in favor of theological precision. Rutledge uses imagery not to decorate, but to 'refame' reality, successfully contrasting the 'soft focus' of culture with the 'bald fashion' of the Gospel. Her stewardship of language is evident in her refusal to use 'renewal' as a synonym for 'resurrection.' The musicality supports the gravity of the message, creating a sermon that sounds both ancient and urgent."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a sophisticated 'Lowry Loop' or narrative arc. It begins by upsetting the equilibrium (the 'Christmas syndrome' of Easter), introduces the 'trouble' (the fear of the women and the reality of death in Detroit), and moves toward the 'grace' of the empty tomb. The 'turning point' is the realization that the terror of the women is the most authentic response to a living God. It sustains tension by not resolving the 'strangeness' of the ending too quickly.",
      "quotes": [
        "The strange ending of his Resurrection story might be for us just the extra thrust we need.",
        "What would give that husband real hope and strength?",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a prime example of Cilliers' 'reframing.' Rutledge takes the context of a 1990s Episcopal parish and reframes it through the 'strange' ending of Mark. She respects the 'strangeness' of the text, refusing to smooth it over for modern consumption. The synthesis of the Detroit tragedy with the Pauline theology of the 'first fruits' is organic and powerful, offering a perspective that the hearer likely did not have upon entering.",
      "quotes": [
        "Christian believers are going to have to work much harder to understand the difference between generic Easter and real Easter.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The polemic against other clergy might distance some 'seekers' she initially welcomed.",
        "Could have explored the 'Galilee' of the Salisbury context more specifically.",
        "The 'witness' conclusion is strong but could be more tightly tied to the 'reframing' of the women's silence."

      "reframing_present": "The sermon successfully reframes Easter from a 'spring festival' to a 'world-overturning event'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (the mother whose child died in spring), it leans toward a 'closed' theological system. Rutledge is authoritative and declarative. While she leaves room for the 'mystery' of God, she leaves little room for 'multiple interpretations' of the text—she is quite clear on what is 'wrong' and 'right.' It is an 'open work' in terms of the encounter with God, but a 'closed work' in terms of its dogmatic boundaries.",
      "quotes": [
        "Renewal, revival, rebirth — these are the wrong words.",
        "I trust the witnesses. That’s what we all are, in the last analysis — witnesses.",
        "Recognizing this utterly new truth means that we will sooner or later be led to relinquish our dependence."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the 'trembling' and 'bewilderment' of the hearer.",
        "The ending on 'witness' invites the hearer to trust rather than just obey.",
        "Does not resolve the pain of the Detroit widower with a 'happy ending'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The tone is occasionally prescriptive ('we are just going to have to get used to this').",
        "Could allow more space for the 'silence' of the women to speak to the silence of the modern skeptic.",
        "The 'wrong words' section is very monovalent."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Theologically 'closed' (declarative) but phenomenologically 'open' (inviting encounter with the Holy)."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are driven by a powerful narrative arc that moves from the 'kitsch' of the gift shop to the 'terror' of the tomb. Rutledge masterfully integrates the Marcan text with contemporary tragedies, using the 'strange ending' of Mark to reframe the hearer's reality. While the structure is dogmatically firm, it creates a dramaturgical space where the 'holy happens' through the confrontation with death and the 'unthinkable' promise of resurrection."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is a profound 'anti-kitsch' manifesto. Rutledge identifies kitsch (bunnies, butterflies, 'Happy Spring') as the primary enemy of the Gospel. She distinguishes between 'sentiment' (the soft-focus greeting card) and 'emotion' (the terror of the women). By refusing to offer 'immediate comfort' to the Detroit widower and instead offering the 'hard' word of resurrection, she achieves authentic aesthetic depth. She sustains the 'pain of suffering' without a cheap happy ending.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "Easter cards with flowers, bunnies, and butterflies.",
      "Generic messages of 'renewal' and 'revival' that ignore death."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the woman whose child died in spring finding fragrances a 'torment'.",
      "The refusal to use 'nature' as a proof for resurrection."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of cultural critique while ensuring the 'welcome' to outsiders remains as warm as the theology is sharp."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens a 'Space for Grace' by clearing away the clutter of moralism and nature-religion. By emphasizing that resurrection is 'unlooked-for' and 'beyond nature,' Rutledge makes grace truly 'gratuitous' (unavailable). She sustains the tension between the 'already' of the empty tomb and the 'not yet' of the 'furrows of the grave.' The mystery of God is respected as something that causes 'trembling,' not something that can be managed.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between death and life are sustained; death is not ignored but 'swallowed up'.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'strangeness' of the Marcan ending is preserved as a gateway to mystery.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the resurrection is presented as a 'gift of faith' and an act of God, not a human task.",
    "recommendation": "To further open space, the preacher could occasionally use more 'poetic' rather than 'declarative' language to describe the 'new conditions' created by the Lord."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.7,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'Reframing' (Cilliers) and 'Witness' (Long). Its primary aesthetic power lies in its courageous 'anti-kitsch' stance, which strips away the sentimental layers of cultural Easter to reveal the 'bald' and 'terrifying' beauty of the Marcan resurrection. Rutledge uses language as a 'steward,' carefully choosing words that do justice to the gravity of death and the radicality of God's intervention. The structure is not a static list of points but a dramaturgical movement that takes the hearer from the 'soft focus' of a church bookstore to the 'pell-mell' flight of the women from the tomb. While the tone is authoritative and occasionally borders on the dogmatically closed, it succeeds in creating a 'Space for Grace' by making the Gospel a 'mighty event from beyond nature.' The sermon is a model of how 'sober beauty' and theological precision can create a performative event where 'the holy happens.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Profound deconstruction of religious kitsch.",
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the Marcan 'fear' as an authentic encounter with God.",
      "High degree of language stewardship and theological precision."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Occasional 'paper language' in long theological/scriptural blocks.",
      "Dogmatic 'closedness' might limit the 'open work' potential for some hearers.",
      "The polemic against other clergy can feel like a distraction from the primary narrative arc."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed (with a focus on the 'Theology of the Word' and 'Reframing')",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Anti-Kitsch) and Thomas G. Long (Preacher as Witness).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to those weary of sentimentality; intellectual 'seekers' and 'mature' believers who value theological depth over emotional manipulation.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'open' endings that leave the 'Galilee' promise as an invitation.",
      "Incorporate more sensory 'showing' in the contemporary applications.",
      "Soften the polemic to maintain the 'open work' aesthetic for a diverse audience."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Rutledge delivers a sermon of high aesthetic quality that functions as a 'corrective lens.' By rejecting the 'aestheticism' of spring flowers, she recovers the 'aesthetic of the sublime'—the terrifying and world-overturning beauty of the Resurrection. It is a sermon that does not just talk about grace but attempts to create a space where grace can be received as a 'gift of faith' amidst a 'dying world.' It stands as a strong example of how the 'Aesthetic Turn' can serve the 'Word' without falling into superficiality."
