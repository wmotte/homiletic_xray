    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically complex. It attempts to be 'Adult' by using sociology and modern references, but it primarily functions as a 'Parent-Child' transaction. The preacher uses the 'unrest' of the younger generation as a lever to induce guilt and inadequacy in the older congregation. By framing their tradition as 'fading wallpaper,' he creates a 'Victim' status for the listeners, then offers himself/his message as the 'Rescuer.' While theologically centered on Christ, the psychological delivery relies on the 'ITHY' game, creating dependency on the preacher's 'modern' insight rather than fostering true Adult autonomy.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Speak more from the 'Adult' ego state: present the biblical text and the sociological observations as data for the congregation to process, rather than using them to diagnose the listeners' 'misery.' Avoid the 'Rescuer' trap of being the only one who 'understands' the youth."
