    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in visual and cinematic quality. Rutledge utilizes a 'double-vision' technique, layering contemporary events (Poland, South Africa, Algeria) over biblical narratives. She follows Wilson's 'show, don't tell' by describing the Saint Michael's booklet cover and the 'tracks made by tears' on Matthew Shepard's face. The imagery is sensory and visceral, particularly when addressing evil, avoiding abstract platitudes in favor of 'blood and body parts.' The use of C.S. Lewis and 'Chariots of Fire' provides a cultural bridge that makes the 'invisible' dimension of the cosmic battle tangible for the hearer.",
      "quotes": [
        "His face was covered with blood except for the tracks made by the tears running down his cheeks as he hung on the fence.",
        "The mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.",

        "Some metaphors (e.g., God's army) are used so frequently they risk becoming 'dead' metaphors if not constantly refreshed.",
        "The transition between the 'blood and body parts' of Algeria and the 'Chinese food' murder is jarring and could benefit from more connective tissue.",
        "The military imagery, while contextualized, may feel overly aggressive for some modern hearers."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strongly weighted toward 'showing.' The preacher paints scenes of both horror and hope rather than merely defining sin and grace."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Rutledge demonstrates high stewardship of language. She avoids 'Canaanite' jargon by explicitly defining terms like 'above and below' as dimensions of reality rather than literal locations. Her language is precise—distinguishing between 'sentiment' and the 'terror and wonder' of the cross. She uses 'we' and 'I' carefully to avoid moral superiority. However, the length of the sermon and the sheer volume of anecdotes occasionally dilute the precision of the central theological argument, leading to a sprawling feel.",
      "quotes": [
        "It refers to dimensions of reality: one dimension is transitory, the other is eternal.",
        "The unaided human tongue is inadequate to the terror and wonder of this once-for-all event.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The sermon is very long; some anecdotes could be tightened for greater impact.",
        "The use of 'ridicule them right back' is a rare moment of less-than-loving language.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a distinct oral cadence, likely due to its 'tent meeting' context. There is a rhythmic use of repetition ('Sometimes it looks like...'), and the inclusion of hymn lyrics provides a lyrical 'breather' for the listener. However, the structure is somewhat staccato due to the frequent shifts between news clippings, literature, and scripture. It lacks the 'legato' flow of a more poetic, meditative sermon, feeling more like a high-energy lecture or a 'recruiting speech' as she herself identifies it.",
      "quotes": [
        "Sometimes it smiles. Sometimes it has beautiful manners. Sometimes it looks like your neighbor.",
        "Ride on, ride on in majesty! In lowly pomp ride on to die.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The frequent reading of long quotes (Havel, Price, Scripture) breaks the preacher's own rhythmic voice.",
        "The transition to the final prayer feels abrupt after the intense theological climax.",

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Predominantly oral language, though the heavy use of external citations occasionally leans toward a 'paper' feel."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is robust, vivid, and unapologetically concrete. Rutledge avoids the 'kitsch' of vague religious comfort by using sharp, often painful imagery. Her 'stewardship of language' is evident in how she translates ancient concepts (the cosmic battle) into modern categories (occupied territory, resistance). While the rhythm is occasionally disrupted by the sheer volume of external quotes, the overall effect is one of 'sober beauty' and rhetorical power that demands attention."

    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot.' It begins by upsetting the equilibrium of the 'gentility' of Charleston, introducing the 'dragons.' The movement is from 'evil out there' to 'evil in here' (the line through the heart). The turning point is the 'invasion from on high' at the cross. It maintains tension by refusing to offer easy moral fixes, keeping the 'Battle of the Bulge' tension between D-Day and V-E Day alive throughout. However, the middle section feels somewhat repetitive as it piles on example after example of evil.",
      "quotes": [
        "What an unlikely spot to be talking about Good and Evil!",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a hallmark of the sermon. Rutledge 'reframes' the context of Charleston (military tradition, social superiority) through the lens of the 'occupied territory' of the New Testament. She respects the 'strangeness' of the apocalyptic texts (Daniel, Mark 13, Revelation) while making them feel urgently relevant to 21st-century news cycles. The synthesis of Desmond Tutu, Václav Havel, and the Gospel of Mark creates a new 'optics' (Cilliers) for the hearer to view their own life and world.",
      "quotes": [
        "We Southerners have lived in a Christian... culture for so long that we forget that Christians are... perpetually under siege.",
        "The line [between good and evil] did not run clearly between ‘them’ and ‘us,’ but through each person.",

      "strengths": [
        "Masterful 'reframing' of the local context (Charleston) via the biblical text.",
        "Surprising but natural connections between political resistance (Solidarity) and spiritual warfare.",
        "Honors the 'otherness' of the Bible without domesticating it."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection to the Ford engine defect feels a bit dated and less 'cosmic' than the other examples.",
        "The 'Southern' context is addressed well, but the 'New York' comparisons might alienate a local audience if not handled carefully.",
        "The 'rebel laying down arms' metaphor could be further integrated into the specific Charleston military history mentioned."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes. It successfully reframes the 'good neighbor' as a 'captured rebel' in need of a cosmic rescue."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "As an 'open work of art' (Stark), the sermon is a mixed bag. On one hand, it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' and the 'mystery' of how God justifies the sinner. It leaves the 'Battle of the Bulge' tension unresolved. On the other hand, the 'recruiting speech' framing and the direct call to 'lay down your arms' are quite directive and monovalent. It forces a specific interpretation of reality (the cosmic war) that leaves little room for alternative ways of relating to the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you ask me how that can be, I will have to say that I do not know.",
        "You can be a collaborator or you can be in the underground resistance, but you can’t just be neutral.",
        "Will you lay down your arms tonight? No, you won’t—but God is going to do it for you."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Admits the 'incomprehensibility' of evil and the mystery of grace.",
        "Avoids 'happy ending' kitsch by emphasizing the ongoing struggle.",
        "Approaches the hearer as a mature partner capable of facing 'harrowing' truths."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'recruiting' metaphor is very 'closed'—it demands a binary choice (enlist or collaborate).",
        "The sermon is 'sealed shut' by a very specific, high-Calvinist dogmatic framework.",
        "Could benefit from more 'open' questions that allow the hearer to find their own place in the 'underground'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent. While it respects mystery, it drives toward a singular, urgent commitment."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The dramaturgy is powerful and driving. Rutledge moves the hearer from the 'outside' (global evil) to the 'inside' (the human heart) with surgical precision. The 'reframing' of the world as occupied territory is aesthetically and theologically consistent. While the structure is somewhat 'closed' due to its rhetorical goal as a recruiting speech, it maintains a high level of tension and respects the 'already/not yet' paradox of the gospel, avoiding the trap of a cheap, kitschy resolution."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a masterclass in anti-kitsch. Rutledge explicitly rejects 'pre-chewed emotions' and 'cheap solutions.' She stares directly into the 'blood and body parts' of Algeria and the 'screaming faces' of racism. There is no 'happy ending' that ignores the 'Battle of the Bulge' of human existence. The comfort offered is not 'sentimental' but 'cruciform'—it is found only in the 'ugly scene of human cruelty' at Calvary. She avoids the 'kitsch' of moralism by insisting that 'no one is righteous.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'television evangelist' who summons belief without suffering (cited as a negative example).",
      "The 'Nobody's perfect' or 'I misspoke' excuses used to domesticate sin."

      "The description of Matthew Shepard's tear tracks.",
      "The honest admission of the alcoholic man who 'drank himself to death' despite his promise."

    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of 'unvarnished' reality; it is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace precisely through the closing of space for human effort. By 'condemning' the hearer's ability to save themselves ('No, you won't [lay down your arms]—but God is going to do it for you'), Rutledge creates a vacuum that only the 'invasion' of grace can fill. She sustains the tension between the 'already' of D-Day and the 'not yet' of V-E Day, which is the definition of Cilliers' 'Space for Grace.' However, the highly directive 'recruiting' tone occasionally threatens to turn grace into a new kind of 'militant' law.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between human depravity and divine intervention is held until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, particularly regarding the 'how' of justification and the 'terror' of the cross.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails, but it is a 'costly grace' that looks like warfare.",
    "recommendation": "Ensure the 'invitation' at the end feels as much like a 'gift' as the earlier sections felt like a 'summons.'"
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically potent example of 'Apocalyptic Homiletics.' It rejects the 'so-called needs' of the hearer (Thurneysen) in favor of a vertical proclamation of the 'invasion' of God. Its aesthetic power lies in its 'sober beauty' and its refusal to look away from the darkness. By using 'cinematic' imagery and 'reframing' the world as occupied territory, Rutledge creates a compelling 'open work' that is nonetheless rhetorically urgent. The sermon avoids religious kitsch with almost aggressive intent, replacing sentiment with the 'terror and wonder' of the cross. While its length and directive 'recruiting' tone may feel 'closed' to some, it successfully creates a 'space for grace' by dismantling the hearer's moral defenses. It is a 'performance' (Immink) of the cosmic drama that invites the hearer to see themselves not as spectators, but as 'lower lights' in a greater host.",

      "Radical anti-kitsch: Staring into the heart of darkness without blinking.",
      "Masterful reframing: Using Narnia, Poland, and South Africa to explain the Gospel timeline.",
      "Vivid imagery: The 'cinematic' quality of the scenes described (Shepard, Elisha, Algeria)."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Length and density: The sermon risks 'anecdote fatigue' by piling on too many examples.",
      "Rhetorical 'closedness': The 'recruiting speech' frame is highly directive and leaves little room for 'tasting'.",

    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Anti-Kitsch) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Four Pages), with the 'witness' stance of Thomas Long.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to those who value intellectual honesty, historical depth, and 'unvarnished' truth over emotional sentimentality.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'open' endings that leave the hearer in the 'between' space without a direct call to action.",
      "Reduce the number of external citations to allow the preacher's own poetic voice more room to breathe.",
      "Use the 'military' metaphor more sparingly to avoid it becoming a 'cliché' within the sermon's own logic."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An exceptionally strong, 'weighty' sermon that demonstrates the power of the 'aesthetic turn' to address the most profound questions of existence. It is not 'beautiful' in a decorative sense, but in its 'transparency toward God' and its 'stewardship of the word.' It serves as a model for how to integrate global context with biblical text without losing the 'scandal' of the gospel."
