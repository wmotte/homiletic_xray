    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in sensory and evocative imagery, moving seamlessly between the biblical 'silent hill' and the 'shutters' of Montgomery. The preacher uses the 'optics' described by Cilliers to help the hearer see the crucifixion not as a past event, but as a present reality in their own streets. The imagery of 'muted trumpets' vs. 'blaring coronation' provides a cinematic transition from the gloom of Friday to the triumph of Easter. The 'gall and the cross' are not abstract theological terms here; they are tethered to the physical and social exhaustion of a boycotting community. It follows Wilson's 'show, don't tell' by painting the 'Friday's lights going out' rather than merely stating that Jesus died.",
      "quotes": [
        "Friday's lights go out, humble men and plain women standing near the silent hill",
        "behind shutters and in rooms of which you know not",
        "The trumpets at the end of the drama are no longer muted; they blare the coronation"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of light and shadow to create atmosphere.",
        "Concrete localization of biblical events in contemporary Montgomery.",
        "Strong sensory appeal through auditory metaphors (trumpets, whispers)."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The metaphor 'armies of the aliens' is slightly archaic and could be more precisely grounded.",
        "The 'silent hill' is a bit of a homiletic trope; a more visceral description of the hill's texture could enhance it.",
        "The transition from 'gall' to 'banners' is rapid; more lingering on the 'cold way' would deepen the pathos."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strongly leans toward 'showing'. The preacher visualizes the soul-searching happening behind closed doors."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is elevated and rhetorical, yet avoids the 'Canaanite jargon' that McEntyre warns against. Words like 'expediency', 'repudiation', and 'denouement' suggest a high level of intellectual precision, yet they are balanced by the 'plain women' and 'humble men' of the opening. The use of 'stewardship of language' is evident in the rhythmic repetition of 'disavowal', 'denial', and 'vindication'. However, some phrases like 'sanity of the universe' border on the abstract-philosophical, which slightly distances the hearer from the immediate sensory experience of the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "the repudiation of the supposed power of expediency and sin",

        "The phrase 'central item on the prayer agenda' feels slightly bureaucratic compared to the surrounding poetry.",
        "The use of 'wickedness' is broad; more precise naming of the 'wickedness' in Montgomery would add bite."

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 9,
      "analysis": "The sermon is a rhythmic masterpiece, clearly designed for oral performance (Immink). The use of anaphora in the final paragraph ('Galling may be... steep may be... long may be...') creates a liturgical cadence that builds momentum and emotional resonance. This is not 'paper language'; it is a score for the voice. The variation in sentence length—from the short, punchy 'Take heart then' to the long, flowing descriptions of the resurrection—demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of rhetorical 'flow'. The cadence mimics the 'long journey' it describes, providing a somatic experience of the struggle through the rhythm of the words.",
      "quotes": [
        "Galling may be our cross, steep may be our way, long may be our journey",
        "the banners are lifted to full mast. Christ leads captivity captive",
        "Wickedness a while may reign, Satan's cause may seem to gain."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Exceptional use of anaphora and parallelism.",
        "Strong percussive rhythm in the final exhortation.",
        "Vocal 'legato' in the theological sections contrasted with 'staccato' calls to action."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition into the quoted hymn/poem is slightly abrupt.",
        "The middle paragraph contains several long, multi-syllabic words that could trip up the rhythm if not paced perfectly.",
        "The 'Take heart then' could be more integrated into the preceding rhythmic build-up."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Pure oral language. The text breathes and demands to be spoken aloud."
    },
    "average_score_language": 8.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is rhetorically sophisticated and deeply musical. It avoids the pitfalls of dry dogmatism by employing a 'poetics of resistance.' The imagery bridges the gap between the ancient text and the modern context with surgical precision. While occasionally leaning into high-literary vocabulary, the rhythmic drive ensures the message remains visceral and grounded in the 'humble' reality of the congregation. It is a prime example of language as an instrument of both beauty and justice."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry), moving from the 'lifeless body' of Friday to the 'blaring trumpets' of Easter. It begins with an 'upsetting of equilibrium'—the crucifixion—and immediately connects it to the 'crucifixion' of the Montgomery community. There is a palpable movement from the 'silent hill' to the 'soul searching' in the city, leading to the theological turning point: the resurrection as the 'reversal of all the world's verdicts.' The arc is tight, though the conclusion relies heavily on a quoted poem rather than a final original synthesis, which slightly dissipates the internal energy of the preacher's own voice.",
      "quotes": [
        "If no other words of committal were uttered over the Lord's lifeless body",
        "the resurrection of the Lord Christ was the reversal of all the world's verdicts",

      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'denouement' is described rather than fully experienced in the structure.",
        "The connection between the 'centurion's words' and the 'Montgomery shutters' could be more explicitly woven.",
        "The ending feels a bit like a 'soft landing' rather than a climactic peak."

      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey from the 'silent hill' of despair to the 'coronation' of hope."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 9,
      "analysis": "This is a textbook example of Cilliers' 'reframing.' The preacher does not just apply the Bible to Montgomery; he frames Montgomery *as* the biblical drama. The struggle for civil rights is reframed as a 'Calvary' that makes the world's conscience sensitive. The synthesis is organic; the 'gall' and 'cross' are both theological symbols and social realities. By stating that Montgomery is on the 'prayer agenda of the world' because of its 'Calvary,' the preacher elevates a local political struggle into a cosmic, redemptive event. The 'strangeness' of the resurrection is used to challenge the 'sanity' of a segregated world.",
      "quotes": [
        "By your Calvary, Montgomery has become a central item on the prayer agenda of the world.",
        "in your crucifixion help crucify the Lord afresh.",

        "Masterful 'reframing' of political struggle as sacred drama.",
        "The biblical text is not a 'springboard' but the very lens of interpretation.",
        "Avoids the 'two-block' problem; text and context are inextricably fused."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The mention of 'distant lands and lonely islands' is a bit vague/romanticized.",
        "Could have integrated the Philippians 1:6 quote more deeply into the Montgomery narrative.",
        "The centurion's role is introduced but then largely abandoned."

      "reframing_present": "A profound new frame is offered: the civil rights struggle is the contemporary manifestation of the Passion and Resurrection."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is rhetorically powerful, it leans toward a 'closed' structure in its theological certainty. Stark's 'open work of art' requires room for ambivalence; here, the 'verdicts' are already reversed. However, there is 'openness' in the acknowledgment of the 'anguished waiting' and the 'rooms of which you know not.' The preacher treats the hearers as 'mature conversation partners' by acknowledging their 'sore spirits' and 'heavy hearts.' The ending, while hopeful, acknowledges that the 'fight' may get harder, leaving the ultimate resolution in the hands of God and the future, which provides a degree of existential openness.",
      "quotes": [
        "even now things of which you and I do not dream are taking place",
        "Wickedness a while may reign",
        "I shall have peace some day."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the 'not yet' of the struggle (the 'long journey').",
        "Leaves room for the 'unseen' work of God in the 'shutters' of the city.",
        "The 'peace some day' is a future-oriented, open hope."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The theological claims (e.g., 'repudiation of all claims of evil') are very absolute and leave little room for the 'lament' of those still suffering.",
        "The structure is somewhat 'sealed' by the triumphalist language of 'blaring trumpets'.",
        "Could benefit from a question that invites the hearer to find their own place in the 'soul searching'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily a 'closed' work of rhetorical persuasion, but with 'cracks' of mystery regarding God's providence."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon exhibits a strong, narrative-driven structure that successfully 'reframes' contemporary suffering through the lens of the Passion. The dramaturgy is effective, moving from the darkness of the crucifixion to the light of the resurrection with rhythmic and emotional force. While the theological conclusions are somewhat 'closed' and triumphalist, the integration of context is so profound that it creates a 'sacred space' for the congregation's struggle. It is a journey from the specific (Montgomery) to the cosmic (God's rule) and back again."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon avoids religious kitsch by refusing to offer 'cheap comfort.' It acknowledges the 'gall,' the 'cold way,' and the 'sore spirits' as real, not just as rhetorical devices. Cilliers' warning against kitsch is heeded because the 'happy ending' (Resurrection) is placed in tension with the 'anguished waiting' and the 'hard lot.' The emotion feels authentic because it is tied to a high-stakes social reality; it is not sentiment for sentiment's sake. However, the 'blaring trumpets' and 'banners' imagery flirts with the 'heroic kitsch' of triumphalism, but is saved by the sobering quote at the end about the 'harder fight.'",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'trumpets blaring' and 'banners at full mast' is slightly clichéd 'triumphalist' imagery.",
      "The 'distant lands and lonely islands' feels a bit like a romanticized missionary cliché."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of soul-searching 'behind shutters' in houses 'you would not dream.'",
      "The acknowledgment that 'Wickedness a while may reign'—refusing to lie about the current pain."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To further distance from kitsch, the preacher could specify the 'cold' and 'hard' aspects of the Montgomery winter or the physical toll of the boycott."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened by the insistence that God is working 'behind shutters' and in 'rooms of which you know not.' This creates a sense of the 'unavailable' and the 'mysterious' presence of God in the midst of political deadlock. The sermon does not end with a moralistic 'to-do list' (which would close space), but with a 'to-be' (the likeness of his resurrection). It sustains the tension between the 'already' of Christ's victory and the 'not yet' of a free America. The 'Space for Grace' is the space where the hearer's 'commitment' meets 'God's providence.'",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between the 'lifeless body' and the 'reigning Lord' is used to mirror the tension of the civil rights struggle.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, particularly in the emphasis on things happening 'beyond your ken of understanding.'",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; even the 'commitment' of the people is framed as being held within God's 'grasp.'",
    "recommendation": "Ensure the 'vindication of the sanity of the universe' doesn't sound too much like a philosophical 'solution' that explains away the mystery of suffering."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'prophetic reframing.' It utilizes the micro-aesthetics of rhythm and imagery to transform a local social crisis into a cosmic drama of redemption. The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long) to a reality that is not yet fully visible but is already 'happening' behind the shutters of the city. The aesthetic power lies in the 'sober beauty' of the language, which manages to be both intellectually precise and emotionally resonant. It avoids the 'religious kitsch' of easy answers by grounding its hope in the 'anguished waiting' of Holy Saturday. The sermon creates a 'Space for Grace' by shifting the burden of victory from the weary marchers to the 'God who rules above,' thereby providing aesthetic and spiritual 'consolatio.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the Montgomery struggle as a contemporary Calvary.",
      "Exceptional rhythmic and musical quality, especially in the use of anaphora.",
      "Vivid, sensory imagery that bridges the biblical and contemporary worlds."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduce the use of abstract philosophical terms like 'sanity of the universe'.",
      "Increase the 'openness' by inviting more hearer-participation in the 'soul searching'.",
      "Temper the triumphalist 'coronation' imagery with more of the 'sober beauty' found in the opening."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Dramatic with a high 'Prophetic-Imagistic' charge.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Four Pages).",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers seeking to connect their personal/social suffering with a larger sacred narrative; those moved by rhythmic, 'performative' preaching.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more 'open-ended' conclusions to allow the 'polyphony' of the congregation's experiences to resonate.",
      "Use more 'staccato' imagery of the city to contrast with the 'legato' of the gospel.",
      "Deepen the 'stewardship of language' by avoiding high-literary terms like 'denouement' in favor of more visceral Anglo-Saxon roots."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically high-quality sermon that demonstrates the power of 'form as content.' By choosing a dramatic, rhythmic, and imagistic form, the preacher does not just talk about hope; he performs it. The sermon is a successful 'Open Work' in the sense that it invites a whole city to see itself within the life of Christ, though it remains firmly rooted in the 'closed' certainty of the Reformed/Prophetic tradition's view of God's ultimate victory. It is a model of how aesthetics can serve the cause of justice without becoming mere 'beautifying writing.'"
