    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively facilitates concrete experience by grounding the biblical narrative in recognizable human emotions and historical markers. The preacher moves beyond abstract leprosy to the 'stigma' of quarantine, using a personal childhood memory of measles signs to bridge the gap between the ancient text and the hearer's life world. However, it lacks a singular, immersive 'slice of life' story that allows the hearer to feel the physical desperation of the lepers before the healing occurs.",
      "quotes": [
        "When I was a lad, it was the law in our place that where someone contracted measles or mumps, a sign would be put on the house",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Reflection is present primarily through the exploration of the 'problem' of ingratitude. The preacher pauses to ask 'why' the nine did not return and analyzes the human tendency to take miracles for granted. The cultural critique of American 'unmixed virtue' provides a moment of social reflection. It falls short of a deeper psychological exploration of why humans are prone to this specific failure of character.",

      "analysis": "The theological depth is moderate. The preacher provides solid exegesis of the Lukan context (the Gospel for the outsider) and the Levitical laws. The 'big idea' centers on the nature of true worship as 'glorifying God.' However, the theological argumentation regarding the 'miracle' of the church's existence feels slightly disconnected from the primary Christological focus of the text.",

The application remains largely at the level of internal attitude (be thankful) rather than external experimentation.

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of narrative-visionary preaching that prioritizes the emotional and relational dimensions of the biblical text. It falls short in providing concrete, practical applications (Active Experimentation), leaving the 'how' of the Christian life somewhat abstract. The preacher effectively uses the 'Diverging' style to create empathy for Jesus and the 'outsider' Samaritan. While the theological exegesis of Luke and Leviticus is solid, the sermon's primary power lies in its poetic conclusion and its ability to make the ancient stigma of leprosy feel contemporary through personal anecdote. The transition to the 'miracle' of church giving feels like a thematic detour that weakens the otherwise tight focus on Christological gratitude. Overall, it is a well-crafted piece of homiletic art that serves the 'heart' and 'imagination' better than the 'will' or 'practical intellect.'",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a clear and effective communication of the Lukan narrative, succeeding primarily in its ability to evoke the 'mood' of the Gospel. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'Diverging' dominant sermon that excels in Concrete Experience and Reflective Observation. It effectively moves the hearer to feel the weight of ingratitude and the beauty of Christ's character. However, to reach the level of a model sermon (score 8+), it would require a more robust 'Active Experimentation' phase and a more disciplined 'Abstract Conceptualization' that avoids thematic drift. The priority for improvement is the development of the 'Pragmatic' window to ensure that the 'Hallelujah' of the conclusion translates into the 'Service' of the following week."
