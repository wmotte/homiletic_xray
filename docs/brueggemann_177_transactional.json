    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust, operating primarily from the Adult ego state. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent ('you must be better') and instead uses historical analysis to invite the listener into a new reality. It promotes autonomy by suggesting that the 'impossible' becomes possible through deliberate, incremental steps rather than emotional manipulation or guilt. The only minor risk is a 'superiority' payoff in the dismissal of traditionalists.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Slightly dismissive tone toward the 'cranky critic' (Critical Parent).",
      "The term 'othering' is used academically; more Nurturing Parent warmth could ground the radical call."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Ensure that the 'five-year plan' is presented as a collaborative Adult exploration rather than a Parent-imposed requirement to avoid triggering the 'Adapted Child' rebellion in the congregation."
