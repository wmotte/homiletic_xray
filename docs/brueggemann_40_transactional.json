  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust, primarily operating from an Adult-Adult stance that respects the listener's reality. It avoids the common trap of 'smothering' Nurturing Parent or 'crushing' Critical Parent. While it flirts with a 'Bait and Switch' by introducing God's 'loathing' in Psalm 95, it quickly returns to a Free Child celebration of grace. The preacher validates human anxiety as a 'material reality' rather than just a moral failing, which promotes psychological integration.",
    "strengths": [
      "Validation of the 'Adult' reality of scarcity and anxiety.",
      "Strong 'Free Child' energy that invites joy rather than just duty.",
      "Identification of the preacher with the congregation's struggles."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to the 'negative' side of Psalm 95 is jarring and risks triggering an 'Adapted Child' fear response.",
      "The list of 'broken cisterns' (sex, cars, portfolios) is a bit of a Critical Parent cliché."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To remain entirely game-free, ensure the 'Switch' (from God's Yes to God's Loathing) is handled with more Adult context to prevent the listener from dropping into a 'Guilty Child' state."
