      "presence": "Low",
      "analysis": "The Adult is largely bypassed. The preacher does not invite the listener to evaluate their life objectively, but rather to 'probe' until they find a reason to feel guilty. The logic is circular: if you feel innocent, you are guilty of pride.",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 2,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. It utilizes a 'Catch-22' logic where both guilt and the absence of guilt result in a 'guilty' verdict. This reinforces a 'You're Not OK' life script. By demanding that even children and animals be punished for adult sins, it promotes a culture of collective shame and dependency on the 'Parent' (the Church/Preacher) for constant 'remedies.'",

      "Over-reliance on the Critical Parent ego state.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult engagement regarding ethical growth.",
      "The use of fear as the primary motivator for religious practice."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as Adult subjects capable of making choices based on values rather than fear. Replace the 'NIGYSOB' trap (where innocence is guilt) with an invitation to authentic self-reflection that allows for the possibility of genuine progress and 'I'm OK' status."
