    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically heavy, relying on the 'Lonely Lord' archetype to trigger the listener's own abandonment anxieties. While theologically rich in the tradition of 'Man of Sorrows,' it utilizes Critical Parent shaming to devalue the listener's current life ('patsies,' 'selfishness') before offering a Nurturing Parent payoff. This creates a cycle of dependency rather than Adult-level spiritual growth.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation from an Adult-to-Adult position. Instead of shaming their interest in the news or social circles, invite them to reflect on how those things fulfill or fail them. Move away from 'shaming' questions ('Dare you think of Tom or Mary?') toward 'exploratory' questions that honor the listener's autonomy."
