    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely game-free. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, using historical and literary analysis to engage the listener's intellect. By deconstructing the 'résumé' culture of New York City, it relieves the Adapted Child of the pressure to perform, replacing it with a Nurturing Parent's assurance of grace. The preacher avoids the Drama Triangle by refusing to play the Persecutor (even when discussing sin) and instead presents a reality-based hope.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'smiling face' behind 'frowning providence' could be misinterpreted by a 'Victim' as a reason to remain passive in the face of actual injustice.",
      "Slight risk of 'smothering' NP in the conclusion's emotional appeal."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' to process reality while inviting the 'Free Child' to wonder. Ensure that the 'Nurturing Parent' voice always points toward the listener's own agency and autonomy in Christ."
