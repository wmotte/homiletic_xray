It starts with genuine empathy for the 'Victim' (the uncertain listener) but quickly moves to 'Rescue' them via institutional 'musts'. The psychological impact creates a dependency on the 'Parent' (Preacher/Church) rather than fostering 'Adult' autonomy in faith.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try replacing 'we must' with 'we are invited to' or 'how might you'. Address the congregation as Adults capable of finding God's path in their specific contexts, rather than just through 'church activities'."
