  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. While it uses the language of grace, it primarily functions through the activation of the Critical Parent and the Adapted Child. By labeling the human psyche as 'loathsome' and 'foul,' it creates a shame-based dependency. The preacher uses 'Formula G' by baiting the listener with a story of healing and switching to a narrative of inherent corruption. This reinforces a 'You're Not OK' life position for the listener, which can only be temporarily relieved by the 'Rescuer' (the preacher's version of Jesus).",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of narrative and rhythm to engage the Child ego state.",
      "Effective use of Adult data in the introduction to establish credibility."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on shame and 'loathsomeness' as a motivator.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult invitation for the listener to reflect on their own life without coercion."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as Adult subjects capable of growth rather than 'loathsome' victims. Reduce the use of 'must' and 'should' and replace 'crawling evils' with descriptions of human struggle that respect the listener's dignity. Aim for an 'I'm OK, You're OK' theological framework."
