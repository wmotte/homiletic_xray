    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a solid exegetical framework by contrasting Luke's account with Mark and John, highlighting the 'apocalyptic note' and the 'power of darkness'. The 'Sache' (the living Christ) is presented as a cosmic warrior engaging the 'ancient Enemy'. However, the analysis remains somewhat descriptive rather than deeply dogmatic. It touches upon the 'battle for salvation' but lacks a rigorous Barthian exploration of the ontological change in the cosmos. The explanation of the Psalms as the foundation of prayer is clear and accessible, yet the theological depth of the 'torn curtain' is mentioned but not fully exploited for its ecclesiological or soteriological weight.",
      "quotes": [
        "The final saying in Luke's Gospel is a direct quotation from Psalm 31:5.",
        "Luke is beloved for the Christmas story... But the Gospel of Luke also has an apocalyptic note.",
        "This is your hour, and the power of darkness (22:53). In other words, it is the Devil's hour."

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a personality that values tradition and academic lineage, specifically through the anecdote about the seminary professor. There is a visible 'diaconal' quality where the preacher's own grief and struggle to believe are hinted at through the stories of others (the bereaved father). The 'I' is present but serves as a bridge to the text. The preacher admits a personal 'confession' regarding the term 'Father', showing a traditionalist but reflective faith. There is a sense of humility, especially in the closing quote from Maclaren, suggesting the preacher views themselves as a 'poor' vessel for a great message.",
      "quotes": [
        "I confess that is enough for me [calling God Father].",
        "I remember in particular talking to him once about great questions of life and death, and the struggle to believe.",
        "My words, I feel, in this sermon, have been very poor."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive with Compulsive nuances. The preacher seeks harmony and closeness ('beloved child', 'loving parent') and uses established tradition (the Seven Last Words, the Psalms) as a structural safety net.",
      "diaconal_quality": "High. The personal anecdotes are used to illuminate the human condition in relation to the Cross, not to center the preacher's ego.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching' and 'Solidary'. The preacher places themselves alongside the congregation ('the kinds of things that preoccupy you and me'). There is a gentle, pastoral tone that avoids 'speaking from above'. However, the use of 'we' can sometimes feel slightly presumptive of the hearer's internal state. The relationship is defined by a shared participation in the 'Good Friday vigil', creating a communal atmosphere of solemnity. There is little 'relationship noise' as the tone matches the gravity of the subject matter.",
      "quotes": [
        "The kinds of things that preoccupy you and me apparently did not enter his mind.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in the balance of 'Zuspruch' (Promise) and 'Anspruch' (Demand). The primary appeal is not a moralistic 'do better', but a 'surrender' or 'commitment' based entirely on Christ's prior action. The 'red side' is directional: it points the listener toward the 'hands of the Father'. The preacher explicitly rejects cheap moralism (the Columbine example) and grounds the possibility of human forgiveness in Christ's 'hard work'. The final appeal is to 'give yourself up', which is a theological response to a gift, not a legalistic requirement.",
      "quotes": [
        "You can trust that. Even as you read, you can give yourself up in this hour.",
        "In his suffering we find our redemption. In his abandonment we find our acceptance.",
        "Forgiveness is hard work!"
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Strongly weighted toward Zuspruch. The demand (Anspruch) is a participation in the gift already given.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Very low. The preacher specifically warns against sentimentalizing or trivializing the cost of grace.",
      "strengths": [
        "Theological grounding of human action in Christ's passion.",
        "Avoidance of 'ready-to-jump' moralism."

        "The final appeal could be even more specific about what 'committing one's spirit' looks like in the 'in-between' of daily life."

    "disruptions": "The transition from the 'apocalyptic battle' to the 'gentle fatherly love' creates a slight theological tension that isn't fully resolved.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is a disciplined and theologically sound meditation for Good Friday. It successfully navigates the tension between the cosmic battle of Christ (Barthian 'Acting Subject') and the personal experience of the believer (Immink). The preacher avoids the 'Hysterical' trap of making the sermon about their own emotions, instead using personal memory to serve the 'Sache'. The analysis of the 'Green' side reveals a preacher who is 'diaconal'—subservient to the text. The 'Yellow' side maintains a respectful eye-level relationship with the congregation, though it occasionally leans into a 'Depressive' harmony that might soften the 'apocalyptic' blow mentioned earlier. The 'Red' side is the sermon's greatest strength, offering a 'Zuspruch' that demands a response of faith without falling into the trap of moralistic legalism. The preacher correctly identifies that forgiveness is 'hard work', thus honoring the gravity of the Cross.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a slight risk of psychologizing the 'Father' image through the lens of Saint Joseph and childhood experience, potentially making God an object of human psychology rather than the Wholly Other. However, the preacher anchors this in the 'business' of the Son, mitigating the risk.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Excellent balance of Law and Gospel (Zuspruch/Anspruch).",
      "Effective use of narrative to illustrate the 'cost' of forgiveness.",
      "Congruent tone that matches the liturgical occasion."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Deepen the dogmatic 'Blue' side regarding the cosmic effects of the Atonement.",
      "Increase the 'prophetic' distance to avoid over-reliance on 'we-solidarity'.",
      "Clarify the transition from 'cosmic battle' to 'nurturing father' to avoid a fractured image of God."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, ample satisfactory sermon that achieves communicative integrity by placing psychological sensitivity at the service of the Gospel promise."
