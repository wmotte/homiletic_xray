It reinforces a Drama Triangle where the congregation is a helpless Victim and Jesus is an invasive Rescuer/Persecutor.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Invite the congregation into an Adult ego state by asking reflective questions rather than making 'magisterial' assertions. Offer the 'sending' as a response to grace rather than a condition for it, thereby avoiding the 'Bait & Switch' game."
