    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates a high level of exegetical competence, particularly in the narrative arc of Acts 3-4. The 'Sache' (theological core) is the Resurrection as an 'inscrutable power for life.' He avoids dry dogmatism by framing the factual content within a conflict between two worldviews: the 'frozen' status quo and the 'surging' power of God. The exegesis of the Greek 'annoyance' (Acts 4:2) is used effectively to explain the psychological and political resistance to the Gospel. However, the 'blue' side remains somewhat abstract regarding the mechanics of the Resurrection itself, choosing to focus on its effects rather than its nature, which aligns with a Barthian emphasis on God as the Acting Subject.",
      "quotes": [
        "The book of Acts... is a hard meeting between the church and worldly authorities.",
        "They were 'much annoyed,' because they were preaching that in Jesus there is the resurrection of the dead.",
        "The God of the Bible is an inscrutable power for life released in the world."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear narrative structure following the text of Acts.",
        "Strong connection between Old Testament (Psalm 98) and New Testament (Acts)."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could benefit from more specific historical context of the Sadducees' 'annoyance'.",
        "The transition between the 'frozen assets' metaphor and the biblical text is rapid."
      ],
      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The language is accessible, using modern metaphors (frozen assets, tea party) to explain complex theological shifts."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as a social critic and a 'dangerous dreamer.' There is an involuntary 'leak' of impatience with the status quo and institutional lethargy. He positions himself not as a distant scholar, but as a witness to a 'minority opinion.' The self-revelation is largely diaconal; he uses his own perspective to champion the text's disruptive nature. However, there is a slight 'hysterical' tendency in the sense of seeking the stage for a grand, dramatic vision of world-change, though it is tempered by a focus on the 'lame man' rather than the preacher's own ego.",
      "quotes": [
        "I announce to you, is unloosed in the world.",
        "We are threatened, because we do not want our tea party upset.",
        "Easter is enough to get sent to prison."

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Schizoid-Hysterical mix. He maintains a certain intellectual distance (Schizoid) while using highly evocative, dramatic language to challenge the audience (Hysterical).",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher/Prophet to Congregation.' There is a palpable tension here. By using 'we' and 'us,' the preacher attempts solidarity, but the 'yellow' signal is often one of confrontation. He assumes the congregation is 'complacent' or 'in despair.' This 'You-message' (you are frozen/annoyed) risks creating relationship noise where the hearer feels judged rather than invited. The 'We-definition' feels slightly forced—the preacher seems to be standing slightly above the 'frozen' world he describes, calling the congregation to join him in the 'newness.'",
      "quotes": [
        "People like us are placed in crisis by Easter.",
        "We are threatened, because we do not want our tea party upset.",
        "The Easter question for us is not whether you can get your mind around the resurrection... but whether you can permit... new healing power."

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The appeal is the strongest side, yet it is complex. The preacher avoids simple moralism (Law) by framing the appeal as an 'invitation' to a 'generous offer' (Gospel/Zuspruch). The 'red' side demands a change in perception: 'notice the dangerous restlessness.' The ratio of Zuspruch (God's power is unloosed) to Anspruch (you must permit it) is well-balanced. He preaches the Resurrection as an indicative (it has happened) that necessitates an imperative (live accordingly). The risk of moralism is low because the 'power' is clearly attributed to God, not human effort.",
      "quotes": [
        "This power, I announce to you, is unloosed in the world.",
        "You can be on the side of the newness that God is now working.",
        "The question is whether you can permit in your horizon new healing power."
      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Strong. The 'Promise' (God shatters categories) is clearly the foundation for the 'Demand' (stop being annoyed/frozen).",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Low. He emphasizes that the power is 'given' and 'unimaginable,' not manufactured by the believer.",
      "strengths": [
        "The appeal is for 'faith/trust' rather than mere 'behavioral change'.",
        "Powerful use of the 'alternative' imagery."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'public matter' of economics/politics could use one concrete example to ground the appeal.",

    "dominant_side": "Red (Appeal) / Blue (Factual Content)",
    "disruptions": "The main disruption is the 'Yellow' side: the preacher's provocative stance may cause some listeners to close their 'Relationship Ear' due to feeling stereotyped as 'complacent.'",
    "healing_disruption": "Yes. The sermon intentionally disrupts the 'frozen' peace of the congregation to make room for the 'restless' Spirit. This is a theological necessity in the Barthian tradition."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a robust, theologically dense sermon that successfully avoids the trap of 'private spirituality.' By applying the Four-Sides-Model, we see a preacher who uses the 'Blue' (Factual) and 'Red' (Appeal) sides with great force. The sermon is Barthian in its insistence that God is the 'Acting Subject' (Immink) whose power 'unsettles and revamps.' The psychological 'Green' side reveals a preacher of the 'Schizoid-Hysterical' type—intellectually sharp yet dramatically expressive. The 'Yellow' (Relational) side is the most vulnerable; the preacher risks alienating the congregation by assuming their 'annoyance' or 'complacency' too readily. However, this 'Relationship Noise' is likely a conscious homiletical choice (Bohren’s 'Healing Disruption') to prevent the Gospel from being domesticated. The balance between 'Zuspruch' (the power is unloosed) and 'Anspruch' (permit this power) is exemplary, ensuring the sermon remains a proclamation of Grace rather than a lecture on morality.",
    "barthian_warning": "Minimal psychologization. The preacher does not focus on 'human experience' as the source of truth, but on the 'Word' (the event of the Resurrection) as the disruptor of experience.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological depth and socio-political relevance.",
      "Strong, evocative metaphors (frozen assets vs. surging power).",
      "Excellent integration of the Acts narrative with the sermon's theme."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Soften the 'Yellow' signals to avoid paternalism.",
      "Provide one concrete 'public' example of the power at work (e.g., a specific peace movement or economic shift).",
      "Clarify the 'Self-revelation' by acknowledging personal struggle with the 'frozen' world."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, communicative act of integrity that prioritizes the 'Sache' of the Gospel over the comfort of the listener."
