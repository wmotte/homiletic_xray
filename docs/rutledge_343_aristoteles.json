    "logos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon exhibits a strong rational architecture built on grammatical and theological distinctions. The preacher utilizes the 'triple passive' in the Greek text to argue for divine agency, moving logically from the text's linguistic details to a broader cosmic framework. The central argument hinges on the 'Two Ages' theology, which is clearly defined and contrasted. The transition from the physical earthquake to the metaphysical 'wrenching' of history is logically traceable. However, the connection between the saints rising at the moment of death versus appearing after the resurrection (a notorious difficulty in Matthew) is glossed over rather than explained, which slightly weakens the exegetical coherence.",
      "quotes": [
        "In Greek there is a triple passive it has even been called 'the great triple passive' the rocks were split, the graves were opened, and the bodies of the dead were raised.",
        "Fundamental to understanding the New Testament is the concept of the two ages, the Old Age and the Age to Come.",

    "pathos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The emotional resonance is achieved through vivid imagery and a direct appeal to common human anxieties. The description of the 'Old Age' uses a litany of mundane and stressful realities (taxes, strikes, Internet) to create a sense of the 'weight' of the world. The preacher successfully pivots from cosmic 'earthshaking' events to the 'prison doors' of the individual heart. While the tone is appropriately somber for Good Friday, it avoids sentimentality. The pathos is effective but somewhat 'clean'; it describes the 'pigsty' of the human condition intellectually without always making the reader feel the 'smell' of it.",
      "quotes": [
        "The universe is wrenched off its axis and sent spinning in another direction.",
        "Is it a loss of love, a sense of abandonment and disappointment, a feeling of being undervalued and uncherished?",

    "ethos": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher's ethos is that of an authoritative teacher and scholar. By citing Paul Minear and T.S. Eliot, the speaker establishes intellectual credibility. However, there is a distinct lack of personal vulnerability. The preacher speaks *to* the congregation about their prisons ('What is your prison door?') but does not explicitly stand *with* them in those prisons. The authority is derived from the office and the text ('The evangelist is telling us') rather than from the witness of a fellow traveler. It is a 'master' ethos rather than a 'witness' ethos.",
      "quotes": [
        "A new book by the noted New Testament scholar Paul Minear makes this point.",
        "One of the worst things that can be said about a preacher is, 'She's not in touch with the real world.'",
        "I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified."

        "High intellectual credibility through the use of scholarly and literary references.",

  "rhetorical_balance_analysis": {
    "dominant_mode": "Logos",
    "suppressed_mode": "Ethos",
    "balance_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward Logos, using theological categories (the Two Ages) to interpret the biblical text. Pathos is used as a secondary bridge to apply these categories to the hearer's life. Ethos remains the most underdeveloped, as the preacher remains a distant, though credible, commentator. The balance is that of a high-quality teaching sermon; it informs the mind and encourages the heart but keeps the person of the preacher largely behind the pulpit.",
    "consequences_of_imbalance": [
      "The hearer may feel instructed but not necessarily 'known' by the speaker.",
      "Intellectual hearers will be highly engaged, but those seeking deep emotional connection may find it slightly academic.",
      "The lack of personal ethos risks making the message feel like a theological lecture rather than a life-and-death proclamation."
    ],
    "recommendation_for_balance": "The preacher should bridge the gap between the 'Two Ages' and their own life, showing how the 'invasion of the future' has specifically impacted their own 'prisons'."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_rhetorical_score": 6,
    "summary": "This is a structurally sound and intellectually stimulating Good Friday sermon. Its primary strength lies in its ability to take a 'bizarre' and often ignored passage of Scripture and give it profound theological weight through the lens of apocalyptic eschatology. The use of the 'Two Ages' framework provides a clear thread that carries the listener from the earthquake at Golgotha to the anxieties of modern life. However, the sermon suffers from a degree of detachment. The preacher functions as an expert guide through a theological landscape rather than a witness to a transformative encounter. While the application is direct, it feels somewhat 'templated'—listing common problems without the grit of personal testimony. The rhetorical quality is high in terms of clarity and argument, but it lacks the 'heart-pathos' and 'vulnerable-ethos' that often characterize the most transformative preaching.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Theological clarity regarding the 'Two Ages' and the 'Triple Passive'.",
      "Effective modernization of the 'Old Age' through recognizable contemporary lists.",
      "Strong thematic consistency centered on the 'reversal' of history."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase personal vulnerability to strengthen Ethos.",
      "Deepen sensory and narrative Pathos in the description of the biblical events.",
      "Address the exegetical difficulties of the text more transparently."
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Rational-Declarative",
    "audience_analysis": "Educated congregants who appreciate theological depth and clear, logical transitions will be most reached.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Include a personal narrative where the 'Age to Come' broke into a personal 'prison'.",
      "Use more 'show, don't tell' imagery in the biblical exposition.",
      "Experiment with varying the vocal tone to match the 'agonized last breaths' of the text."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an effective piece of homiletical teaching that successfully communicates the 'Orthodoxy' of the cross. It scores well on Logos due to its coherent structure and theological depth. It achieves a moderate score in Pathos by identifying human struggles, though it remains somewhat cognitive. Its lowest score is in Ethos, as the preacher's personal presence is obscured by scholarly authority. Overall, it is a 'good' sermon (6/10) that fulfills its liturgical purpose but stops short of being a compelling 'witness' event."
