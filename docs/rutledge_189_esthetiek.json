    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating concrete human analogies to explain abstract theological concepts. The opening imagery of a parent's desperation (mortgaging the house, going without sleep) effectively 'shows' the weight of Paul's apostolic concern. The use of the 'watchman' metaphor from Psalm 130 is handled with poetic sensitivity, moving from the 'depths' to the 'dawn.' While it occasionally leans on traditional metaphors (lost sheep, light/radiance), the preacher revitalizes them by grounding them in visceral human experience. The 'stench' of the situation is felt in the description of the 'crabbed, tumultuous' letter to Corinth. However, some sections remain conceptually dense without a corresponding visual anchor, particularly when discussing the internal relations of the Trinity.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and demonstrates high stewardship. The preacher avoids 'Canaanite' jargon by defining terms through context (e.g., explaining 'fear of the Lord' as respect for majesty rather than terror). There is a sophisticated engagement with liturgical history (the BCP changes), showing that words matter. The choice of adjectives—'crabbed,' 'tumultuous,' 'perfunctory'—reveals a writer who weighs the sound and meaning of every term. The distinction between 'Something' and 'Someone' is a sharp, precise rhetorical move. The sermon avoids the 'sloppy thinking' Grözinger warns against by being honest about the 'vast primordial catastrophe' of sin without resorting to platitudes.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is crabbed, tumultuous, disjointed, wildly uneven.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a rhythmic cadence, particularly in its use of litany-like repetitions ('without restraint, without measure, without calculation'). This creates a liturgical 'flow' that suits the oral nature of preaching. There is a clear variation in sentence length—short, punchy sentences for emphasis ('You are desperate.') followed by longer, flowing clauses for theological reflection. The use of parallelism in the description of the parent's actions provides a driving momentum. However, the second half (Psalm 130) feels slightly more 'academic' and 'paper-like' due to the block quotes from the Prayer Book, which interrupts the natural rhythmic pulse of the preacher's own voice.",

    "summary_language": "The poetics of language in this sermon are robust and intentional. The preacher demonstrates a high degree of 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre), using precise, evocative adjectives to bring the biblical text to life. The imagery is grounded in universal human experiences—parental anxiety and the watchman’s wait—which prevents the theology from becoming abstract. While the rhythm is generally strong, particularly in the use of rhetorical repetition, the sermon occasionally slows down during liturgical critiques. Overall, the language is 'sober-beautiful,' avoiding excess while maintaining a high aesthetic and intellectual standard."

      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon employs a 'Lowry-esque' upsetting of the equilibrium by starting with a crisis (the self-destructing child). This creates immediate tension. The movement from Paul's 'desperation' to the 'fullness' of the Trinitarian blessing is a clear dramaturgical path. However, the sermon is structured as two separate reflections rather than one unified arc. The second segment on Psalm 130 follows its own mini-arc from 'the depths' to 'redemption,' but the connection between the two halves is thematic rather than narrative. The 'turning point' in the first half is the realization that the blessing is for the 'church that was breaking his heart,' which is a strong, surprising move.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength. The preacher 'reframes' (Cilliers) the Trinity not as a mathematical puzzle but as the 'desperate' love of a parent. This synthesis of the ancient text (2 Cor 13) and the modern experience of parental angst is organic and illuminating. The context of the 'messed-up lives' of the congregation is brought into direct conversation with the 'crabbed' nature of Paul's letter. The sermon respects the 'strangeness' of the biblical world while making it urgently relevant. It avoids the pitfall of using the text as a mere springboard; instead, the text's specific liturgical placement (the longest blessing for the worst church) drives the application.",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is somewhat 'monovalent' in its theological conclusions, though it leaves 'space' for the hearer's own experience. By inviting the hearer to 'Reflect on your own life' and 'Think about those people,' the preacher creates an 'open work' (Stark) where the hearer fills in the blanks with their own history. However, the theological 'answers' regarding sin and grace are presented with a high degree of certainty and authority. While this provides 'consolatio,' it leaves less room for the 'ambivalence of existence' that Stark advocates for. The ending is a 'renewed confidence,' which is a 'happy ending' that, while grounded in the text, feels slightly 'sealed shut.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Reflect on your own life. Think about those people who have borne with you.",
        "For many of us, this was our parents, but not for all of us; some of us will have had parents who failed us.",

    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics of the sermon are characterized by a strong 'reframing' of traditional dogmas. The preacher successfully moves the Trinity and the concept of Sin from the realm of 'dry scholarly doctrine' into the 'last ditch' of human experience. The narrative arc is most effective in the first segment, where the tension of a failing relationship drives the movement. While the two segments are somewhat disconnected structurally, they share a consistent 'dramaturgy of grace' that moves from the 'depths' of human failure to the 'radiance' of divine mercy. It is a journey of 'perception' (Cilliers)."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It explicitly rejects 'vague, romanticized versions of human love' and 'cheerful, domestic ideas of God.' By describing Paul's letter as 'crabbed' and 'too painful to read,' and by insisting on the 'vast primordial catastrophe' of sin, the preacher avoids the 'happy ending' cliché. The emotion feels authentic because it is rooted in the 'agonized' and 'desperate' reality of human relationships. It does not offer 'immediate comfort' but forces the hearer to stand in the 'depths' before looking for the 'dawn.' The refusal to smooth over the 'strangeness' of the text is a strong anti-kitsch marker.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'glimmer of full radiance' imagery is slightly conventional, but saved by the context.",

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a textbook example of 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers). It creates space by first acknowledging the 'depths' where there is 'no health in us.' By deconstructing the 'petty record keeping' of moralism, it opens a vast horizon for the 'inexhaustible' love of God. The 'Space' is not a vacuum but a 'dynamic interrelatedness.' The preacher successfully sustains the tension between human 'self-destruction' and divine 'resurrection power' without resolving it through human effort (moralism). Grace is presented as an 'operative reality' (Immink) that 'pursues us even beyond the grave.'",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between the 'messed-up lives' and the 'full Trinitarian blessing' is held beautifully.",
    "mystery_respected": "While the Trinity is explained, it is described as 'humanly incomprehensible majesty,' respecting the mystery.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails entirely; moralism is explicitly 'repudiated.'",
    "recommendation": "To increase space further, allow the 'silence' of the 'depths' to linger longer before introducing the 'forgiveness' of verse 4."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high level of homiletic aesthetics, particularly within the Reformed/Anglican tradition of 'sober beauty.' Its greatest strength lies in its ability to 'reframe' (Cilliers) abstract dogmatic categories—the Trinity and Original Sin—into visceral, relational realities. The preacher avoids the 'kitsch' of easy comfort by insisting on the 'crabbed' and 'agonized' nature of both the biblical text and human existence. The language is precise, demonstrating a 'stewardship of words' (McEntyre) that makes every adjective count. While the structure is somewhat bifurcated due to the two distinct liturgical focuses, the thematic consistency of 'grace in the depths' provides a coherent aesthetic experience. The sermon 'shows' more than it 'tells' in its best moments, particularly in the opening parental analogy. It creates a 'space for grace' by systematically dismantling the hearer's impulse toward 'petty record keeping' and moralism, replacing it with a vision of a 'Someone' who pursues the 'messed-up' with 'inexhaustible' love.",

      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the tension of the 'watchman' unresolved.",
      "Integrate liturgical history more narratively to avoid the 'paper language' feel.",
      "Use more sensory language related to 'smell' or 'touch' to complement the 'visual' imagery."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically strong sermon that honors the 'aesthetic turn' by making the form (the 'agonized' parent) the content (the 'self-giving' God). It avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch and moralism, creating a wide 'space for grace' that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally authentic. It is a model of how to handle 'difficult' doctrines with 'poetic power.'"
