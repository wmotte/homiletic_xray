    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful piece of rhetoric that successfully connects personal lifestyle to global ethics. However, from a TA perspective, it relies heavily on a Parent-Child dynamic. It creates a binary where 'Beef = Hate/Strife' and 'Herbs = Love/Peace.' This oversimplification can trigger Adapted Child guilt rather than Adult reflection. The preacher oscillates between a Nurturing Parent offering a vision of peace and a Critical Parent judging the 'extravagance' of the listeners.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Avoid the 'Ain't It Awful' trap by moving beyond collective complaining about 'modernity.' Instead of using 'must' or 'should' (even implicitly), ask Adult-level questions that invite the listener to evaluate their own reality without pre-packaged moral binaries."
