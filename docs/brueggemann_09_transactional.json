    "summary": "The sermon is a masterclass in imaginative homiletics but contains a significant psychological 'sting.' It begins by liberating the listener's Free Child with vivid, non-domesticated imagery (Sea Monster, Banquet). However, it executes a classic TA 'Switch' in the second half. By justifying the expulsion of the guest in the Matthew text, the preacher moves from a Rescuer/Nurturing Parent to a Persecutor/Critical Parent. The psychological impact is a 'double bind': the listener is told grace is free, but then told they 'must' perform joy and 'cannot' whimper, which actually suppresses authentic Child feelings in favor of an Adapted Child mask.",
    "strengths": [
      "High Free Child energy in the use of metaphor.",
      "Strong Nurturing Parent empathy for the poor and marginalized.",
      "Effective Adult analysis of social power structures."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The shift from 'gift' to 'insistence' creates a coercive atmosphere.",
      "The dismissal of the guest's 'speechlessness' ignores the reality of trauma/depression (where one cannot simply 'put on' joy)."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Avoid using the 'Buster' persona to enforce emotional responses. Instead of saying 'you must,' try 'What would it look like if...?' This invites the listener's Adult to explore the metaphor without the threat of the 'outer darkness.'"
