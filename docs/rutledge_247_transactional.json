  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This is a psychologically robust sermon that operates primarily from the Adult ego state. It avoids the common homiletical trap of using the Critical Parent to demand political or religious compliance. Instead, it empowers the listener through the concept of 'discernment,' promoting autonomy and personal responsibility. The use of historical 'Free Child' examples (Tutu, Moses) provides an aspirational model of psychological health—maintaining internal freedom regardless of external constraints.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of Adult-to-Adult transaction.",
      "Avoidance of the Drama Triangle despite a high-stress political context.",
      "Promotion of autonomy through the 'gift of discernment.'"
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "A slight tendency toward 'Nurturing Parent' sentimentality regarding the Harvard legacy could be tightened to maintain Adult objectivity.",
      "The 'Free Child' element could be even more pronounced to balance the heavy intellectual 'Adult' content."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'as though' (theology of provisionality) to prevent the sermon from hardening into a 'Critical Parent' dogma. Keep inviting the listener to 'discern' rather than 'obey.'"
