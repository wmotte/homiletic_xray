[...] Take that to the center of your life until money become just money. Scatter your gifts, and wait until you see how he works through that. Let us pray.",

  "aristotelian_modes_analysis": {
    "logos": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The rational architecture is exceptionally strong and serves as the sermon's backbone. The preacher explicitly outlines a three-point structure (power of money, why it has power, how to break it) and adheres to it strictly. The use of 'nuggets' from Proverbs is not random but categorized logically. The argument regarding the 'righteous' vs. 'wicked' is built on linguistic exegesis (Bruce Waltke) rather than sentiment, providing a stable intellectual foundation. Transitions are clear, and the internal logic—moving from the sociological effect of money to the psychological 'why' and finally the theological solution—is highly traceable.",
      "quotes": [
        "In a sense, we’re going to learn three things here. We’re going to learn that money exercises great power over us, why it exercises great power over us, and how to break that power over us.",
        "The problem is money never exists in itself. It always exists in somebody’s life, and there it magnifies and amplifies whatever is in the heart.",
        "The Old Testament says you reap what you sow... but think about the agricultural metaphor. When you sow seed, do you go out later on in your harvest and reap seed? No, you reap fruit."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear, explicit three-part deductive structure.",
        "Precise definitions of biblical terms (righteous/wicked) that challenge modern assumptions.",
        "Effective use of contrast (scattering vs. gathering) to build a logical paradox."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition between the 'day of wrath' and 'hollowing out character' could benefit from more explicit causal links.",
        "The jump from Old Testament tithing to New Testament sacrifice is logically fast and could use more textual support.",
        "The distinction between 'money as a god' and 'money showing your god' is subtle and could be clarified further."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "The sermon excels in 'Rational Architecture' by transforming a fragmented book (Proverbs) into a coherent, logical system."
    },
    "pathos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Pathos is present but functions primarily as 'head-pathos'—an intellectual description of emotion rather than a visceral evocation of it. The preacher uses 'slices of life' (buying books, clothes, the 'day of wrath' news) that are highly recognizable, creating a sense of resonance. However, the tone remains largely didactic. The description of the cross at the end significantly raises the affective power, moving from the abstract to the concrete suffering of Christ. While it avoids manipulation, it occasionally lacks the 'heart-warmth' that would make the conviction feel more like comfort and less like a lecture.",
      "emotional_tone": "Serious, convicting, and analytical.",
      "quotes": [
        "It’s the day you find somebody you thought was your best friend or a trusted companion has betrayed you in a major way.",
        "It’s an effort for me to give money away... it always takes your breath away a little bit.",
        "They whipped him with 39 lashes. They pulled the very flesh off his body. They broke him, speared him, and nailed him."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Relatable 'slices of life' regarding consumer habits (books vs. clothes).",
        "Vivid, sensory description of the crucifixion to ground the theological point.",
        "Honest acknowledgment of the 'breath-taking' difficulty of generosity."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'day of wrath' section is described clinically; more evocative language could deepen the emotional stakes.",
        "The tone is somewhat repetitive in its intensity; more variation in warmth or joy could balance the conviction.",
        "The appeal to the community's needs is abstract; a concrete story of a 'righteous' business owner would increase resonance."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Pathos is effective through recognition and identification but remains secondary to the logical argument."
    },
    "ethos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher establishes strong Ethos through vulnerability and the 'witness' role. Rather than speaking from a position of moral superiority, he includes himself in the struggle ('every single person in this room, including me'). The self-deprecating example of buying expensive academic books serves to humanize the speaker and demonstrates that he is subject to the same 'idolatries' he diagnoses in the congregation. Authority is derived from the text ('Don’t shoot the messenger') and scholarly expertise (referencing Waltke), creating a balance of humility and competence.",
      "authenticity": "High degree of personal vulnerability regarding intellectual pride and spending habits.",
      "quotes": [
        "I’m just here to tell you. Don’t shoot the messenger. It’s true.",
        "Let me give you an embarrassing example. It’s an effort for me to give money away.",
        "My primary identity is who I am in Jesus Christ... but I get a lot of significance out of knowing things."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Use of personal struggle as a primary illustration of the sermon's core thesis.",
        "Avoidance of moralizing; the preacher stands 'under' the word with the audience.",
        "Transparent admission of the difficulty of the biblical standard."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'expert' persona (referencing Hebrew scholars) is effective but could occasionally feel like 'authority as master' if overused.",
        "More emphasis on the preacher's own 'joy' in generosity (if applicable) would balance the 'struggle' narrative.",
        "The conclusion's direct challenge on tithing could be softened by more explicit 'we' language to maintain the witness role."
      ],
      "specific_diagnosis": "Strong Ethos built on the 'good man speaking well' who is honest about his own heart's complexity."

    "dominant_mode": "Logos",
    "suppressed_mode": "Pathos",
    "balance_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a high-functioning example of the 'Rational-Declarative' style. Logos provides the framework, Ethos provides the accessibility, and Pathos provides the closing punch. The balance is effective because the logical clarity earns the right to make the emotional and personal demands found in the final third. However, the intellectual weight of the first half is so significant that it may leave less-analytical hearers behind before the emotional resonance of the cross is introduced.",
    "consequences_of_imbalance": [
      "Analytical hearers will be highly engaged, but those seeking immediate comfort may find the first 20 minutes 'cold'.",
      "The heavy Logos might make the sermon feel more like a classroom lecture than a worship service for some.",
      "The high Ethos prevents the Logos from becoming arrogant, but doesn't fully compensate for the lack of early Pathos."
    ],
    "recommendation_for_balance": "Introduce the 'Pathos' of the broken heart or the 'day of wrath' earlier and with more narrative depth to soften the heavy exegetical opening."

    "orthopathy_pathos": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon successfully awakens conviction and a sense of need, but could further develop the 'God-fearing joy' associated with the Gospel."

    "orthopraxy_ethos": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher models the 'righteous' person by being transparent about his own heart, though the application is more about 'heart-change' than specific 'hand-actions'."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_rhetorical_score": 7,
    "summary": "This is a rhetorically sophisticated sermon that excels in logical clarity and personal credibility. The preacher successfully navigates the difficult terrain of Proverbs by creating a thematic 'mine' of verses that support a singular, powerful argument: money is a god-substitute that can only be dethroned by the cross. The sermon's greatest strength is its ability to redefine 'righteousness' and 'wickedness' in a way that bypasses modern political categories and strikes at the heart of the hearer's identity. While the sermon is intellectually dense, it is saved from being a mere lecture by the preacher's willingness to use his own life as a laboratory for his theology. The final movement toward the cross provides a necessary emotional climax, though the path to get there is primarily cognitive. It is a 'sober' sermon—direct, honest, and demanding.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional logical structure and thematic synthesis of Proverbs.",
      "High Ethos through the use of self-deprecating and relatable personal examples.",
      "Powerful Christological climax that grounds ethics in the substitutionary work of Christ."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase the use of sensory and narrative Pathos in the first half of the sermon.",
      "Clarify the logical transition between 'character hollowing' and 'making money'.",
      "Ensure the 'expert' references (commentaries/Hebrew) don't create a distance between the pulpit and the pew."
    ],
    "primary_rhetorical_style": "Rational-Declarative with a Witnessing-Visionary conclusion.",
    "audience_analysis": "Most appealing to urban, educated, and 'skeptical' or 'intellectual' believers who value logical consistency and authenticity over emotionalism.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a narrative opening to engage Pathos immediately.",
      "Use more 'we' language in the diagnostic sections to reinforce the witness role.",
      "Provide one concrete 'success story' of generosity to balance the 'struggle' narrative."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a strong 7/10. It is a model of how to preach 'wisdom literature' through a Gospel lens. It avoids the common pitfalls of moralism and emotional manipulation, relying instead on the 'compelling logic of the cross'. While it could benefit from more affective warmth, its rhetorical integrity and logical force make it a highly effective piece of homiletic communication."
