    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in visual evocation, particularly through the ekphrasis of Holman Hunt’s 'The Light of the World'. The preacher follows Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' by describing the 'tall weeds' and 'neglected cottage' rather than just stating the heart is messy. The imagery of the door without a handle is a classic homiletical trope that functions as a powerful 'living metaphor'. However, the sermon occasionally leans on traditional metaphors that border on 'dead' (e.g., 'winds of eternity', 'balm in Gilead'), which prevents a higher score. The sensory details of 'shaking with laughter' and 'shivering in nameless grief' effectively ground abstract grace in human physiology.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Lord Jesus stands in the painting at the door of a neglected cottage which shows signs of falling into ruin.",
        "In front of the cottage, tall weeds grow and long grass waves on the pathway leading to the door.",
        "I am the shadow of a great rock in a weary land."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong use of ekphrasis (describing a work of art) to anchor the biblical text.",

        "Incorporate more auditory or olfactory images to complement the visual dominance."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strongly 'showing' in the first half through the painting; more 'telling' in the middle section regarding social duties."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is dignified and pastoral, showing a clear 'stewardship of language' as McEntyre advocates. The preacher avoids overly technical jargon, though 'unsearchable riches' and 'communion' are used without much fresh definition. There is a slight tendency toward rhetorical inflation ('supreme texts', 'grand pilgrimage', 'vibrates with endless love'). While the precision in describing human relationships (husband/wife, parent/child) is strong, the theological language remains somewhat conventional. The use of 'worthies' to describe heart and mind is a clever, precise rhetorical touch that avoids dry psychology.",
      "quotes": [
        "I wonder if we have allowed frequent repetition here as worship begins to dull the cutting edge of these words.",
        "You will be, I hope, in the wrong church this morning if you want the preacher to get at your feelings while you mind is excused.",
        "Don't snicker at this clothing exchange across the street. Don't turn up your nose at community efforts."

        "Clear distinction between sentiment and integrated 'heart and mind' thinking.",

        "Avoid repetitive fillers like 'I daresay' or 'Well, you say'."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Moderate; uses traditional liturgical language ('paradise', 'holiness', 'righteousness') but grounds it in the 'exchange' metaphor."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a highly oral text. The rhythm is established through deliberate parallelisms and the use of hymn fragments and spirituals. The cadence of the 'You say... He says' litany at the end creates a powerful staccato effect that builds toward a liturgical climax. The preacher understands the 'musicality' of the sermon as an event in time, using repetition ('That knock sounds and that voice calls') to create a resonant, almost hypnotic effect. It avoids 'paper language' entirely, feeling like a spoken performance even on the page.",
      "quotes": [
        "In all our days and years, in all our comings and goings, in all our risings and fallings.",
        "Hush, somebody is calling my name. Hush, somebody is calling my name, O my Lord, what shall I do?",

        "Some of the longer sentences in the introduction could be broken up for better breath control.",
        "The repetition of 'Don't...' in the social section feels slightly monotonous compared to the rest."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Purely oral language; clearly written for the ear with strong rhetorical cadences."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high level of micro-aesthetic quality, particularly through its rhythmic structure and visual imagery. By utilizing the Holman Hunt painting as a central 'image-base,' the preacher successfully 'shows' the theological concept of Revelation 3:20. The language is pastoral and evocative, though it occasionally relies on traditional homiletical flourishes that lack contemporary sharpness. The integration of music and liturgical repetition creates a 'musical' experience that transcends mere information delivery, making the sermon a performative event rather than a dry lecture."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry), moving from the 'familiarity' of the text (the equilibrium) to the 'risk' of the 'if' (the upsetting). The turning point is the realization that the door has no handle on the outside. However, the middle section on social programs (nursing homes, clothing exchanges) feels like a 'thematic detour' that slows the narrative momentum. The arc recovers in the final 'exchange' dialogue, but the energy dips in the middle due to a shift from narrative to moral exhortation. It is more of a 'dynamic journey' than a three-point sermon, but the path is somewhat winding.",
      "quotes": [
        "I wonder if we have allowed frequent repetition here... to dull the cutting edge of these words.",
        "That is not a mistake... that door has no handle on the outside. It opens only from within.",
        "Now the awesome risk, the terrible option, the fateful choice!"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong opening that challenges the 'boredom' of the congregation.",
        "The 'handle' revelation serves as a genuine 'aha!' moment in the plot.",
        "The concluding dialogue provides a satisfying emotional and theological resolution."

        "Tighten the connection between the 'risk of choice' and the specific social ministries mentioned.",
        "Ensure the 'upsetting' of the equilibrium (the risk) is sustained throughout the middle section.",

      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey that suffers from a slight 'sag' in the middle section."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon achieves 'reframing' (Cilliers) by taking a well-known, almost 'kitsch' text and painting, and re-presenting it as a 'terrible risk'. It connects the biblical 'knocking' to the mundane (nursing homes, family tensions, breakfast programs). This synthesis of the 'grand pilgrimage' of worship with the 'bruising life' of the street is effective. The preacher respects the 'strangeness' of God's desire to 'sup' with humans, framing it as an exchange of our poverty for His riches. However, the application to 'governments' and 'astrology' feels slightly dated and less organically connected to the text than the family/social examples.",
      "quotes": [
        "Don't dismiss with some smart-aleck remark this breakfast program for children each morning.",
        "A husband calls out for encouragement, but the wife does not hear.",
        "The Lord is saying that he will take of what we have and he will give us what he has."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Successful 'reframing' of Revelation 3:20 from a 'sweet' image to a 'risky' choice.",
        "Honest integration of local congregational life (the death of William Clapp, local ministries).",
        "The 'exchange' metaphor bridges the gap between ancient text and contemporary need."

        "Deepen the context: how does the 'if' apply to the specific 'bruising' of modern life beyond general social work?",
        "Make the transition from the painting to the 'governments' section more fluid.",
        "Address the 'resistance' to the knock more specifically—why do we keep the door shut?"
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes; it reframes the 'knocking Jesus' from a passive image into a radical call for human agency and social response."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "While the sermon speaks of 'risk' and 'choice', the structure is relatively 'closed' (Stark). The preacher provides the answers and the interpretations quite definitively. The final dialogue, while moving, is a closed loop: 'You say... He says.' There is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or for the hearer who might *not* want to open the door. It leans toward a 'coercive schema' of grace—beautifully presented, but leaving little space for the hearer's own struggle with the 'if'. The ending is a 'happy ending' that resolves the tension perhaps too neatly.",
      "quotes": [
        "You will be, I hope, in the wrong church this morning if you want the preacher to get at your feelings while you mind is excused.",
        "Never mind what the house is like; he will see about that.",
        "Good, give me that. That's just what I need."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The 'if' acknowledges human freedom as a real factor.",
        "The invitation is warm and inclusive of 'broken hearts'.",
        "The preacher as 'witness' (Long) is clear in the final exchange."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Leave more 'open space' at the end for the hearer to contemplate the 'risk' without immediate resolution.",
        "Acknowledge the difficulty of hearing the knock amidst the 'noises of selfish striving' more deeply.",
        "Allow for the possibility of 'resistance' (Stark) within the sermon's own logic."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent; the preacher guides the interpretation toward a single, albeit beautiful, conclusion."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is characterized by a strong narrative impulse that occasionally falters into moralizing lists. The use of the 'Homiletical Plot' creates a sense of movement, and the 'reframing' of a familiar text is largely successful. However, the sermon lacks the 'openness' of a true 'opera aperta,' as the preacher maintains tight control over the meaning and resolution. The dramaturgy is effective for a traditional congregation, providing a clear path from the 'upsetting' of familiarity to the 'resolution' of grace, but it avoids the deeper 'inter-esse' of unresolved tension."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon narrowly avoids religious kitsch by acknowledging 'bruising life' and 'nameless grief'. However, the use of the Holman Hunt painting—a staple of religious kitsch—is a risky aesthetic choice. The preacher redeems it by focusing on the 'missing handle' (theology of choice) rather than just the 'lovelight in his eyes' (sentiment). The final litany of 'give me your weakness' borders on the 'happy ending' cliché but is saved by the rhythmic, almost liturgical depth of the language. It flirts with sentimentality but usually anchors it in the 'cutting edge' of the 'if'.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The description of 'lovelight of Calvary in his eyes' is classic sentimental kitsch.",
      "The 'balm in Gilead' and 'shadow of a great rock' are used as pre-chewed emotional triggers."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The mention of the 'stench' of the 'bruising life' and the specific local social needs.",
      "The intellectual demand that the 'mind' not be excused while the 'feelings' are engaged."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To increase depth, spend more time in the 'darkness' of the closed door before moving to the 'light' of the sup. Avoid the 'lovelight' adjectives in favor of more rugged descriptions of grace."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace through the 'reframing' of the human heart as a place where God *wants* to be, despite its ruin. Cilliers' 'Space for Grace' is evident in the 'exchange' section, where human poverty is not a barrier but an invitation. However, the space is slightly 'closed' by the moralistic list of social duties in the middle, which feels more like 'law' than 'grace'. The 'mystery' of the knocking is respected, but the 'mystery' of the human 'no' is largely ignored.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained regarding the 'risk' of the 'if', but resolved quite quickly in the final dialogue.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the 'unsearchable riches' is proclaimed, though the preacher attempts to 'detail' the knocking perhaps too much.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the end, but moralization takes a significant 'middle page' in the sermon.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'if' to remain a haunting question for the hearer even after the sermon ends. Don't resolve the 'risk' so completely."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of mid-to-late 20th-century 'New Homiletic' preaching, characterized by a high degree of imagery and a clear narrative arc. Aesthetically, it succeeds in 'reframing' a familiar, potentially clichéd text into a dramatic encounter with the 'risk' of faith. The use of the Holman Hunt painting provides a visual 'center' that allows the congregation to 'see' the theology. The language is rhythmic and oral, making it an effective 'event' in the sense of Immink. However, it falls short of the highest aesthetic scores due to a somewhat 'closed' structure that doesn't allow for much hearer-interpretation (Stark) and a middle section that feels more like a social report than a continuation of the poetic arc. The 'Space for Grace' is clearly articulated through the beautiful 'exchange' litany at the end, which serves as the aesthetic and theological climax.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful use of visual imagery (the painting) to anchor abstract theology.",
      "Strong rhythmic and musical quality, especially in the concluding dialogue.",
      "Effective 'reframing' of a familiar text as a 'terrible risk' rather than a cozy sentiment."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Reduce the 'closedness' of the sermon by leaving more room for the hearer's own struggle with the 'if'.",
      "Better integrate the social application so it doesn't feel like a dramaturgical detour.",
      "Prune sentimental 'pulpit' adjectives to avoid the trap of religious kitsch."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Imagistic with a Reformed-Social emphasis.",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Paul Scott Wilson's 'Four Pages' (Trouble/Grace balance) and Thomas Long's 'Preacher as Witness'.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals most to a traditional, literate congregation that values both 'heart and mind' and appreciates classic religious art and hymnody.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the congregation in the 'space' of the text.",
      "Use more contemporary, 'secular' imagery to ground the 'knocking' in 21st-century life.",
      "Read the text aloud during drafting to identify and remove 'paper language' in the application sections."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically effective 'performance' that honors the 'sober beauty' of the Reformed tradition while embracing the narrative power of the New Homiletic. It avoids the 'vertical' coldness of dialectical theology by focusing on the 'human factor' and the 'aesthetics of perception'. While it flirts with kitsch, its rhythmic integrity and intellectual rigor (the 'mind' requirement) keep it grounded. It is a 'good' (7/10) sermon that serves as a strong example of how to use imagery to open a space for grace, even if it keeps that space under fairly tight homiletical control."
