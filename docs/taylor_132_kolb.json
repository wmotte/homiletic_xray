    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is exceptionally strong in facilitating concrete experience. It begins with a specific, relatable narrative about 'Tom' on a golf course, which grounds the message in the everyday world. The preacher uses vivid imagery—traffic moving fast, lights burning late, horses running—to create an emotional 'hook'. By identifying with the 'slick' Jacob or the 'ordinary' Isaac, the hearer is invited to see their own life reflected in the biblical narrative. The emotional connection is maintained through empathetic descriptions of human failure and longing.",

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "Reflective observation is present but less developed than the experience phase. The preacher pauses to ask why people feel they outgrow God or why they feel their talents are too small. There is a cultural critique of 'living it up' and the 'complex problem of race'. However, the sermon often moves quickly from the observation of a problem to the theological solution without fully exploring the 'why' of the human condition or the complexity of the struggle.",
      "quotes": [
        "But something is haunting Tom... an awareness, a sense, a feeling, a belief that, though stricken of conscience, he has a part in God's love.",

    },
    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "Theological depth is somewhat sacrificed for narrative flow. While the 'big idea'—that God is the God of all types—is clear, the exegesis of Matthew 22 is minimal. The preacher uses the text as a springboard for character studies rather than exploring the original context of the Sadducees' question about the resurrection. The theological framework is primarily one of universal divine concern rather than a rigorous dogmatic exploration of the nature of the living God.",

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase of the sermon. While the preacher offers encouragement, there are few concrete action steps. The call to 'work for the better, fairer world' and the mention of voting are the most specific applications, but they are not integrated into a clear 'how-to' for the hearer's daily life. The sermon ends on an emotional and visionary note rather than a pragmatic one, leaving the 'Active Experimentation' largely to the hearer's own initiative.",
      "quotes": [

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of narrative-visionary preaching that prioritizes emotional resonance and imaginative engagement. It falls short in the areas of theological depth (Abstract Conceptualization) and practical application (Active Experimentation). The preacher effectively uses the 'Concrete Experience' of both contemporary and biblical characters to lower the threshold for the hearer, making the grace of God feel accessible. However, the lack of rigorous exegesis and concrete action steps means the sermon functions more as an inspirational 'mood piece' than a transformative learning cycle. It addresses the 'Diverging' and 'Accommodating' learning styles well but leaves the 'Assimilating' and 'Converging' learners with little substance to grasp.",

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a highly effective piece of visionary rhetoric that succeeds in making the hearer feel the 'weight' of God's love. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'half-cycle' sermon: it excels at bringing the hearer into an experience and reflecting on it, but it stops short of providing the conceptual framework or the practical tools for sustained change. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'vision' of God's love and the 'practice' of living it out, ensuring that the 'hands' are as engaged as the 'heart'."
