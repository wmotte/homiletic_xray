  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 7,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically supportive, leaning heavily on the Nurturing Parent ego state to soothe the listener's Adapted Child. It avoids the toxic 'shame-cycles' common in many sermons. However, it risks creating a 'Rescue' dynamic where the listener is encouraged to remain in a Child state, dependent on a powerful external figure to 'hush' the storms, rather than developing Adult coping mechanisms. The use of Free Child imagery is a strength, as it invites the listener into a space of wonder and authentic emotion.",

      "Strong use of Free Child imagery to engage the listener's imagination.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward Adult-Adult communication, ask the congregation more reflective questions that require them to process their own 'storms' rather than just providing the poetic solution. Be careful with 'prescriptions' for mental health (like sleep) that oversimplify complex Adult realities."
