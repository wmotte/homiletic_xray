      "analysis": "The sermon is highly Adult-oriented. It uses 'we' language, processes historical data (Mandela, Havel), and analyzes the mechanics of injustice (economic distribution) logically. It invites the listener to 'consider' and 'imagine.'",

        "presence": "High",
        "analysis": "The 'Free Child' is present in the poetic descriptions of 'stumps' turning green and 'kids playing over the hole of the asp.' It is an appeal to the creative imagination rather than the moralistic will.",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a rare example of psychologically healthy homiletics. It avoids the traditional Parent-Child trap of 'preaching at' people. Instead, it uses Adult-Adult transactions to invite reflection. By validating the listener's fear and inertia, the preacher bypasses the Adapted Child's resistance. The use of poetic imagery (Free Child) serves to bypass the Critical Parent's defenses, allowing for a genuine 'Aha!' moment regarding social justice and peace.",
    "strengths": [
      "High degree of transparency and lack of coercion.",
      "Strong identification between preacher and listener (Adult-Adult).",
      "Validation of the listener's psychological reality (fear, normalcy)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to 'baptismal promises' could be softened to ensure it doesn't land as a 'Parental' guilt-trip.",
      "More concrete 'Adult' examples of the 'little acts' could further ground the poetic vision."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'invitational' language. To maintain this high health score, ensure that the 'Spirit' is always described as an empowering force for the listener's autonomy, rather than a mystical Parent that the listener must 'let in' (which can trigger the Adapted Child)."
