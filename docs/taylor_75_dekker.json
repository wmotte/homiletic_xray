  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses the text as a thematic anchor but fails to identify what is unique to this specific passage. It treats 'temptation' as a general biblical concept rather than exploring the specific Corinthian context of idolatry and overconfidence. It relies heavily on external passages (the temptation of Jesus, Abraham, Moses) rather than mining the specific depth of 1 Corinthians 10.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Scriptures doubtlessly intend to lump under that word all that puts faithfulness to God under test.",
        "Scripturally, temptation usually is that which tests our faithfulness to God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify what 1 Corinthians 10:13 says that cannot be found in the Lord's Prayer or the wilderness temptation. Focus on the 'way of escape' as a specific promise to a community tempted by social and religious compromise."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of Greek/Hebrew study or historical-critical engagement. The preacher ignores the immediate context of Paul's warning against the examples of Israel in the wilderness. The exegesis is replaced by personal anecdotes and general biblical cross-referencing.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Scriptures, however, use the word temptation in a different way.",
        "Luke's account of the temptation then says a surprising thing..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Research the Greek term 'peirasmos' and the specific historical situation of the Corinthian church regarding 'common' human trials versus their specific cultural pressures."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding church life (gossip, slander), which Dekker values. However, it often veers into general psychological categories (weariness, pride) without sharp cultural analysis of the 'zeitgeist'. The 'haunted house' metaphor is evocative but remains somewhat abstract.",
      "quotes": [
        "I name you now, you talebearers, you gossipmongers, you slander merchants — partners of hell...",
        "The temptation of spiritual weariness, the temptation of pride, the temptation of spiritual laziness..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond general lists of sins to analyze how the current cultural moment specifically pressures the believer to abandon faithfulness."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exposition and application are not so much interwoven as they are both subordinated to a thematic essay. The 'hearer' is addressed, but the 'text' is not being unfolded simultaneously with the life of the hearer; rather, the text provides a 'motto' for the preacher's own reflections.",
      "quotes": [
        "Think of your life as a house, and reflect on how many tenants live in that residence.",
        "The Lord advises us through the apostle Paul to look upon temptations with due seriousness..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Structure the sermon so that the movement of the text (the warning, the limit, the promise) dictates the movement of the application."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon strongly addresses 'misery' (the haunted house, the threat of falling) and 'redemption' (God's faithfulness). It concludes with 'gratitude' (praising and serving). However, the 'misery' is often portrayed as external attacks rather than the internal 'misery before God' that Dekker emphasizes.",
      "quotes": [
        "That we live out our days close to death is perhaps too obvious...",
        "God's deliverances do not come before the moment of need.",
        "So in it all, God makes us able to praise him..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by addressing the heart's inclination to fall, rather than just external 'hellhounds'."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is a strong point. The preacher takes the possibility of 'falling' and being an 'ally of hell' very seriously. There is a clear sense that human choices matter and that one can be 'lost' in their conduct within the church.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.",
        "If and when you join in damaging a brother's reputation... you are an ally of hell."

      "improvement_point": "Clarify the 'destination' of these ways more explicitly—is the loss temporal or eternal in the context of this specific text?"

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned and his temptation is used as a model, but he is not strictly the 'telos' (goal) of the sermon. The sermon ends more on God's general faithfulness and the human ability to 'bear it' rather than the person of Christ as the sole life of the believer.",
      "quotes": [
        "Anything which tries to pull you away from your loyalty to your God as you have known him in Jesus Christ...",
        "Jesus faced the temptation of physical welfare..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Show how Christ *is* the 'way of escape' mentioned in the text, rather than just an example of one who escaped."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1350 words, the sermon likely lasts 13-14 minutes. According to Dekker, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for true homiletical 'depth'. It remains at the level of an address or meditation.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical and cultural-philosophical analysis to reach the 20-minute threshold, allowing the text to breathe."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short primarily in its formal requirements: it lacks rigorous exegesis of the original Greek context and is significantly too short (approx. 14 minutes). It functions more as a thematic speech on 'temptation' than an exposition of 1 Corinthians 10. However, it succeeds in taking the 'two ways' seriously and provides concrete, sharp application regarding congregational conduct.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application regarding church gossip and the ethical responsibility of members.",
      "Serious tone regarding the possibility of 'falling', avoiding a 'safe' or liberal trivialization of sin.",
      "Effective use of the 'misery' category through the 'haunted house' metaphor."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specific exegesis; the preacher does not explain the text but uses it as a springboard.",
      "Insufficient length to achieve the 'depth' Dekker demands.",
      "Christ is used as an example (moralism) rather than being the theological telos and source of grace."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate hortatory speech, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict sense of Dekker’s theses. It lacks the necessary breadth of study (Hebrew/Greek) and the specific focus on what makes *this* text unique. It is a bicycle wheel improperly mounted."
