    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. While it uses the language of 'love' and 'grace,' it functions to reinforce a Parent-Child dependency. It utilizes guilt and the 'miserable offender' archetype to bypass the Adult ego, making the listener's sense of worth entirely dependent on the religious institution's definitions. The 'Bait & Switch' from unconditional love to the requirement of self-loathing is a classic manipulative tactic in homiletics.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation from the Adult ego position. Instead of telling them they have 'no health,' ask them to objectively observe the 'depths' of their experience. Move from being a 'Rescuer' of 'miserable offenders' to a 'Witness' of human complexity. Allow the 'Free Child' to experience joy without first requiring a ritual of self-abasement."
