    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a rare example of psychologically healthy homiletics. It uses the Adult ego state to dismantle the dysfunctional Parent-Child dynamics often found in church settings. By identifying as a 'sinner' alongside the congregation, the preacher prevents the formation of a Drama Triangle. The transition to the capital campaign is handled with Adult transparency rather than Parent-driven guilt.",
    "strengths": [
      "Dismantling of religious hierarchy and clerical idealization.",
      "High degree of transparency and shared vulnerability.",
      "Use of objective linguistic analysis to provide a 'reality check' for the listeners."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The connection between 'unconditional grace' and the 'capital fund drive' is a delicate pivot that could be misinterpreted as a subtle 'Gimmick' for those prone to guilt."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'Adult' ego state to explain the 'Parent' (Law) and 'Child' (Grace) dynamics. Ensure that the call to action (building fund) remains an invitation for the 'Free Child' to respond in joy rather than an 'Adapted Child' responding to a perceived 'Parental' expectation."
