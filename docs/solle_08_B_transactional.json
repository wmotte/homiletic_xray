    "psychological_health_score": 7,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically robust because it avoids the standard 'Critical Parent' to 'Adapted Child' dynamic common in religious texts. Instead, it uses the preacher's own vulnerability (Adult/Child) to invite the listener into a shared reality. While it flirts with the 'Ain't It Awful' game regarding church structures, it ultimately seeks to empower the 'Free Child' through the 'Adult' recognition of social truth. The impact is one of mobilization rather than shaming.",
