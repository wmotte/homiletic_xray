When I drive down to visit my mother in Virginia, I always stop there. They used to have a decent number of people in attendance, but last week [...] There is no one who does not play a part, and the mighty works of God continue apace, and each person may at any time be called out of his or her place to give assistance to God’s great enterprise, and the angels rejoice to see the little churches in the wilderness — because he watching over Israel slumbers not nor sleeps. Praised be the living God! AMEN.",

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a strong concrete experience by describing a specific visit to a church in Maryland. It grounds the biblical narrative in the physical reality of 'two women of a certain age' and later uses vivid imagery to describe Elijah as an 'action figure.' However, the experience of the widow herself is mediated through a 19th-century commentary rather than direct narrative immersion, which slightly distances the hearer from her immediate struggle.",
      "quotes": [
        "When I drive down to visit my mother in Virginia, I always stop there... last week there were only two — two women 'of a certain age.'",

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. The preacher pauses to analyze the 'why' behind Elijah's journey, specifically the necessity of humility. There is a sophisticated cultural and ecclesiastical critique of the 'mainline' vs. 'evangelical' divide, asking why certain churches are failing. It moves beyond the story to observe the underlying spiritual patterns of power and vulnerability.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is the Lord’s hard way of teaching us our place before him. Beware of the doctor who has never been sick...",

      "analysis": "The theological core is the concept of the 'Living God' (Theos) versus human-centered activity. The sermon formulates a clear 'big idea': the church exists only in its standing before God. While the exegesis is solid, it relies heavily on Krummacher’s 19th-century framework rather than developing a fresh systematic theological argument for the 21st century.",

While the sermon calls the congregation to be a 'little church in the wilderness' and to 'tell truth to power,' these remain largely abstract or corporate calls. There are few concrete, individual action steps for the hearer to implement on Monday morning. The application is more about the 'identity' of the church than the 'action' of the believer.",

The preacher successfully moves the hearer from a personal anecdote to a broad theological vision, but the 'Active Experimentation' phase remains largely metaphorical. The reliance on Krummacher provides historical depth but occasionally slows the narrative pace.

    "conclusion": "This is a high-quality sermon for a university-town congregation, demonstrating 'priestly listening' and 'prophetic discernment.' From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon that prioritizes reflection and conceptualization over concrete experience and experimentation. While it successfully challenges the 'human-centered' engine of the mainline church, it risks becoming the very thing it critiques—an intellectual exercise—if it does not ground its 'Living God' theology in the 'hands' of the congregation. The priority for improvement is to close the learning cycle by translating the 'vision' of the wilderness church into the 'practice' of the wilderness church."
