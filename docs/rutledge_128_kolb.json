    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively grounds the theological claims in concrete human experiences of grief and the physical reality of death. It avoids abstract 'feel-good' sentimentality by confronting the visceral 'look and feel' of a corpse. The preacher connects with the specific audience (visitors, skeptics, the grieving) by naming their likely motivations and current emotional states. However, it lacks a sustained narrative arc where the hearer 'walks' through a single story; it relies more on a series of sharp, recognizable vignettes.",

        "I have never become immune to the shock of watching the appalling change in the look and feel of the body.",

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength of the sermon. The preacher engages in a robust cultural critique, analyzing why modern people (and the 'Jesus Seminar') struggle with the Resurrection. He pauses to ask 'Why are you here?' and 'Why is this so?', deconstructing the common 'spring festival' interpretation. He forces the hearer to observe the inadequacy of secular or liberal-religious responses to real tragedy. The reflection is deep, intellectual, and culturally situated.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a clear theological 'Big Idea': the Resurrection is a radically discontinuous, anti-natural act of God, not a metaphor for nature. The exegesis of 1 Corinthians 15 and Luke 24 is solid, though it functions more as a 'proclamation of truth' than a 'logical build.' The conceptual framework is dogmatic and orthodox, emphasizing the physical empty tomb and the faithfulness of God. It lacks, however, a nuanced exploration of the *mechanics* of how this truth integrates with other doctrines.",

      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the sermon ends with a powerful vision of hope, it offers few concrete 'action steps' or ethical calls for the 'Monday morning.' The application remains largely internal/dispositional: having 'hope and strength and courage.' It tells the hearer *what to believe* and *how to feel* about death, but not specifically *how to live* differently in the coming week, other than 'defiance.'",

    "overall_kolb_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a robust, intellectually rigorous defense of the orthodox Resurrection faith. It falls short primarily in the 'Active Experimentation' phase of Kolb’s cycle, offering little in the way of concrete, practical application for the daily life of the believer. It functions excellently as a 'Declarative' and 'Visionary' piece, successfully deconstructing modern secularized versions of Easter (Reflective Observation) and replacing them with a high Christology (Abstract Conceptualization). The preacher effectively uses his own intellectual journey and the visceral reality of death to create 'Concrete Experience,' though this is often quickly transitioned into polemic. The primary strength lies in its refusal to settle for 'innocuous sentiments,' forcing the hearer to confront the 'anti-natural' claim of the Gospel. However, the lack of a 'Pragmatic' dimension means the learning cycle is not fully closed; the hearer is left with a new 'belief' but not necessarily a new 'practice.'",
    "strengths_top_5": [
      "Intellectual honesty regarding the 'ugliness' of death.",
      "Effective deconstruction of 'nature-myth' interpretations of Easter.",

      "Converging learners are underserved due to the lack of practical utility and problem-solving application."

    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Strengthen the Pragmatic task by asking: 'If this is true, how does it change our approach to [specific local issue] this Tuesday?'",
      "Include a 'Narrative' that demonstrates the Resurrection power in a living person, not just a biblical character.",
      "Use more 'priestly listening' to identify the specific *struggles* of the congregation, not just their *intellectual doubts*."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a high-quality example of 'Advocacy' preaching. It scores well on the 'Reflective' and 'Conceptual' phases of Kolb’s cycle, providing the hearer with a solid intellectual and theological foundation. Its diagnosis of the cultural moment is sharp and its normative claims are clear. However, from a learning theory perspective, it is an incomplete cycle. By neglecting the 'Active Experimentation' and 'Pragmatic' tasks, it risks leaving the hearer in a state of 'abstract idealism'—convinced of a truth but unequipped to live it out. The priority for improvement is the integration of concrete, ethical, and practical handles that bridge the gap between the empty tomb and the Colorado Springs streets."
