        "analysis": "The preacher avoids 'must' and 'should' language, instead using personal confession to model behavior. There is a slight CP tone when critiquing 'cynical clergy' or 'successful people,' but it is directed at attitudes rather than the listener's personhood.",

      "analysis": "The sermon is highly Adult-oriented. It processes objective data (news clippings, novels, theology) and engages in self-correction (the anecdote about the atheist friend). It invites the listener to observe reality as it is, including the reality of pain and death.",

        "analysis": "The preacher does not speak from a place of needing to please a demanding God or a demanding congregation. He admits to his own 'vanity,' which is a Free Child move that bypasses the Adapted Child's need for a perfect mask.",

    "risk_explanation": "The only slight risk of an ulterior transaction is the 'conspiratorial' story about the successful couple, which could be seen as a subtle 'Parent -> Child' shaming of social ambition, but the preacher quickly crosses this by admitting he shares the same weakness."

    "absence_of_games_analysis": "The preacher explicitly deconstructs potential games like 'I'm Only Trying To Help You' (ITHY) by acknowledging that faith does not immediately remove 'wrenching pain.'

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exemplary model of psychologically healthy homiletics. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, utilizing self-disclosure not as a performance, but as a means to level the playing field between pulpit and pew. By explicitly rejecting manipulative 'carrots' (dangling heaven to convert), the preacher avoids the 'Bait & Switch' game. The use of the Federici family story serves as a powerful Adult-Adult observation of reality rather than a sentimental Rescuer narrative. The preacher successfully navigates the tension between the 'now' and the 'not-yet' without falling into the 'Ain't It Awful' trap of collective passivity.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of transparency and Adult-Adult engagement.",
      "Explicit rejection of manipulative conversion tactics.",
      "Integration of the Free Child (honesty about fashion/success) to build trust."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The critique of 'cynical clergy' borders on a Critical Parent 'NIGYSOB' moment.",
      "The transition from the fashion industry to 'being scared' could be more clearly processed as an Adult observation rather than a Child fear."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements to model the struggle of faith. Ensure that when critiquing 'the world' (Versace, etc.), it remains an Adult analysis of values rather than a Critical Parent dismissal of people."
