    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating visceral, human scenarios to ground abstract doctrines like the Trinity and Sin. By using the 'parent of a self-destructing child' as an entry point, the preacher employs sensory and emotional imagery that Paul Scott Wilson would categorize as effective 'showing.' The description of the child—hooked on drugs, anorexic, or a runaway—creates a sharp, cinematic mental image. However, the imagery becomes more conventional and less sensory when moving into the theological 'heart' of the Trinity, relying on light metaphors (radiance, glimmer) which, while classic, lack the gritty originality of the opening. The second half uses the 'watchman' image from the Psalm effectively, though it remains largely within the biblical metaphor rather than expanding it into new sensory territory.",

        "maybe she is anorexic and starving herself, maybe he has run away from home.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates a high degree of stewardship of language, particularly in the critique of liturgical changes. There is a clear effort to rescue words like 'miserable' and 'health' from modern misunderstanding. The language is precise, avoiding 'Canaanite' jargon while still honoring theological depth. The use of adjectives like 'crabbed, tumultuous, disjointed' to describe Paul’s letter shows a literary sensibility that avoids the 'beautifying' trap Grözinger warns against, opting instead for honesty. The distinction between 'Something' and 'Someone' regarding the Trinity is a mark of linguistic precision that clarifies the relational nature of God without becoming overly academic.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The rhythm is generally steady and professional, but it occasionally leans toward 'paper language,' particularly in the middle section discussing the Book of Common Prayer. The opening paragraph has a strong, urgent cadence created by the repetition of 'you would...' which builds tension effectively. However, the second half of the sermon (on Psalm 130) becomes more didactic, losing the rhythmic drive of the introduction. There are moments of staccato impact ('This is honesty leading to deliverance'), but the overall flow is more akin to a high-quality essay than a poetic performance. It lacks the 'musical' peaks that characterize the most aesthetically advanced preaching.",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' and intellectual precision. It avoids religious kitsch by grounding high doctrine (Trinity, Sin) in visceral human experiences (parental desperation). The preacher exercises excellent stewardship of language, particularly in reclaiming 'lost' liturgical terms. While the imagery is strong in the introduction, it becomes more conventional later. The rhythm is effective for a teaching-style sermon but lacks the lyrical intensity of a truly poetic 'event.' It is a text that respects the hearer's intelligence and the gravity of the subject matter."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Lowry-esque' plot, beginning with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium' through the image of a self-destructing child. This creates immediate tension. The preacher then links this tension to Paul’s 'agonized' state, moving from human desperation to divine self-giving. The second half (Psalm 130) follows a similar movement from the 'depths' to the 'dawn.' However, because the text seems to be two combined meditations, the overall arc feels somewhat fragmented. The 'turning point'—the discovery of forgiveness as the source of fear—is intellectually satisfying but could be dramaturgically sharper. The energy remains high because the stakes (life, death, self-destruction) are consistently kept in view.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Corinthian church has gone completely off the rails...",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong point. The preacher 'reframes' the Trinity not as a mathematical puzzle but as the 'desperate parent' of humanity. This is a classic Cilliers 'reframing'—taking a familiar, tired formula and placing it in a new, urgent frame. The integration of the 1976 prayer book controversy provides a specific ecclesiastical context that makes the biblical text feel relevant to the congregation's identity. The sermon respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the 'crabbed' nature of 2 Corinthians) rather than smoothing it over. It successfully bridges the 'then' of Paul and the 'now' of the hearer through the universal experience of relational brokenness.",
      "quotes": [
        "The church that was breaking his heart is the one that gets the full Trinitarian blessing.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is relatively 'closed' in its theological conclusions, though it leaves room for the hearer's personal reflection. By asking the hearer to 'Reflect on your own life' and 'Think about those people,' the preacher creates an 'open work' where the hearer provides the content. However, the theological resolution is quite traditional and 'sealed.' The preacher provides the answers to the 'depths' fairly quickly. While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (parents who fail us), it ultimately moves toward a very certain, prescriptive ending. It is more of a 'witness' (Long) than an 'open work of art' (Stark), which fits the Reformed-Anglican tradition but limits polyvalence.",

        "Reflect on your own life. Think about those people who have borne with you.",

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily monovalent, but with 'windows' for personal appropriation."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The sermon exhibits a strong, purposeful dramaturgy. It moves effectively from human crisis to divine resolution, utilizing the 'reframing' technique to make ancient texts feel urgent. The integration of liturgical history adds a layer of intellectual weight. While the structure is somewhat fragmented due to the combination of two texts, each section has a clear internal movement. It functions as a 'witness' to the Gospel, providing a clear path for the hearer, though it leans more toward theological certainty than aesthetic openness."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids the 'happy ending' trap by describing Paul’s letter as 'crabbed' and 'painful.' It explicitly warns against a 'vague, romanticized version of human love.' By acknowledging that some parents fail their children, it avoids the sentimentalism often found in family-based analogies. The preacher sustains the 'pain of suffering' by listing prisoners and the incurably ill. The emotion feels authentic because it is rooted in the 'vast primordial catastrophe' rather than easy sentiment. It is a 'sober' aesthetic that takes sin seriously.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None significant, though the 'glimmer of radiance' metaphor flirts with conventional religious imagery.",
      "The 'straining forward to the dawn' is a standard trope, but here it is grounded in the 'depths'."

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space for grace is opened by the radical insistence on human helplessness ('no health in us'). By shutting the door on human merit ('petty record keeping'), the preacher forces the hearer to look toward the 'vertical' dimension of God's self-giving love. The 'Space for Grace' is found in the 'inter-esse' between the 'depths' and the 'dawn.' However, the space is slightly crowded by the preacher's strong polemic against liturgical changes, which shifts the focus from the 'mystery of God' to 'ecclesiastical debate.' Nevertheless, the emphasis on God as the 'Someone' who pursues us beyond the grave creates a genuine opening for the Holy.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between human failure and divine love are sustained well until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "The Trinity is treated as a relational mystery rather than a logical problem.",

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of 'Sober-Reformed' aesthetics with a literary-Anglican sensibility. Its primary aesthetic power lies in its honesty and its ability to 'reframe' traditional doctrines through the lens of intense human relationality. It avoids the pitfalls of kitsch by refusing to sentimentalize love or minimize sin. The language is precise and carefully stewarded, showing a deep respect for the weight of words. While it lacks the rhythmic 'performance' of a more charismatic or poetic style, it gains authority through its intellectual and emotional integrity. The 'show, don't tell' principle is applied effectively in the introduction, creating a cinematic entry point that sustains the hearer's attention through the more didactic sections. The sermon successfully creates a 'Space for Grace' by systematically dismantling the hearer's reliance on their own 'merit,' leaving them in the 'depths' where only the 'Someone' of the Trinity can reach them.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Authentic, non-sentimental reframing of the Trinity through parental love.",
      "High level of language stewardship and precision in reclaiming theological terms.",

      "Incorporate more sensory details (sound, smell) to balance the visual/conceptual imagery.",
      "Read the text aloud specifically to identify and break up 'paper language' in the middle sections."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically 'good' to 'strong' sermon (7/10) that excels in integrity and reframing. It avoids the 'kitsch' of modern therapeutic preaching by insisting on the 'vast primordial catastrophe' of sin, thereby making the 'Space for Grace' truly expansive. It is a model of how to handle high doctrine with human pathos."
