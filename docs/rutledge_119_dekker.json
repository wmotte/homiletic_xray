Why, we might ask, should Paul be ashamed? What is there about the gospel to be ashamed of? [...] For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. (1 Cor. 15:17-22) AMEN."

      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's primary formal requirement: it is not an exposition of ONE specific passage. It functions as a thematic speech on 'the curse' and 'sin' using a collage of texts (Romans, Galatians, 2 Corinthians, 1 Peter, 1 Corinthians). It lacks the specificity of what *this* text says that can be found nowhere else.",

      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is a basic awareness of the historical shame of the cross (Roman context), but it remains at the level of general theological knowledge. There is no evidence of deep engagement with the original languages or the specific theological argument of the biblical books cited.",
      "quotes": [

      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon avoids the 'block' structure (first theory, then practice). It moves between the biblical concept of sin/curse and modern reality. However, because there is no single text being 'expounded', the hearer is drawn into a *theme* rather than being 'expounded' together with a specific Scripture.",

      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "The sermon excels here. It takes 'misery' (sin as a condition/curse) with extreme seriousness. It does not sentimentalize man. Redemption is clearly 'outside' the self (Christ becoming a curse). Gratitude is implied in the shift to 'living to righteousness'.",

      "findings": "The sermon addresses the reality of being 'lost' (temporal and eternal) through the imagery of the 'God-damned' and the 'curse'. It takes the perpetrator's soul seriously, acknowledging the possibility of 'rotting in hell' without turning it into a cheap threat.",
      "quotes": [
        "They jeered, 'Bye, bye, King!' and 'Rot in hell!'... Projecting our own fears and hatreds onto a person like King is easy.",

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is the clear telos. The sermon is grounded in the substitutionary atonement (becoming a curse). It avoids moralism by pointing to salvation outside the self. However, the use of multiple texts makes the Christology feel more like a dogmatic summary than a textual discovery.",
      "quotes": [
        "In the Cross of Jesus, we see the God-forsakenness of sin.",

      "findings": "At approximately 16.5 minutes (1650 words), the sermon falls short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. While it has thematic depth, it lacks the 'breadth' that comes from sustained exegetical drilling into a single passage.",

    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon fails the most fundamental formal criterion of Dekker: it is a thematic address based on a collection of verses rather than an exposition of one specific Bible passage. Consequently, it lacks the 'specificity' of what can be found 'nowhere else'. However, it is substantively strong in its refusal to sentimentalize sin (misery) and its insistence on the substitutionary nature of the cross (redemption).",
    "strengths": [
      "Radical seriousness regarding human sin as a condition rather than mere misdeeds.",
      "Excellent use of concrete, non-sentimental contemporary examples (Jasper, Will Campbell).",
      "Clear Christocentric focus on the 'curse' and substitution."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of a single underlying pericope (Thematic 'keyword' preaching).",
      "Insufficient duration to achieve the 'breadth' required for true homiletic depth.",
      "Exegesis is secondary to the preacher's thematic narrative."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "According to Dekker’s definition, this is an 'adequate speech about the gospel' but not a 'sermon' in the strict sense, because it lacks the recreation of a specific Bible passage into a new, current word. It is a 5/10: theologically sound but formally deficient."
