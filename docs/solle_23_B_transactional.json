By redefining God as a changing, repenting, and 'motherly' being, it invites the listener into a mature, bilateral relationship (Covenant) rather than a submissive one. It identifies 'Resignation' as a psychological and spiritual sickness and uses 'Free Child' imagery (Rainbow, Dance) to provide an emotional counter-weight to 'Adult' political analysis.",

      "The 'we' identification could occasionally mask the preacher's own authority.",
      "The final absolution moves quickly from 'Adult' analysis to 'Nurturing Parent' comfort, which might bypass the listener's own processing."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name the 'Gimmicks' (fear, powerlessness) of the world as you did, as this prevents them from being used in psychological games within the church."
