    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the manipulative 'games' often found in homiletics. By integrating a strong Adult ego state (acknowledging the lack of evidence) with a Nurturing Parent (validating the pain of parents), the preacher creates a safe space for the listener's Free Child to hope without being forced into an Adapted Child's blind obedience. The use of the 'station-master's dog' metaphor provides a healthy, non-coercive way to conceptualize faith.",

      "The 'soldier' imagery, while traditional, carries a slight risk of triggering a Critical Parent/Adapted Child dynamic if not carefully contextualized."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements when discussing belief ('These are some of the reasons I believe') as it models Adult responsibility and prevents the preacher from slipping into a dogmatic Critical Parent position."
