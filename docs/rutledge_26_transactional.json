    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exceptional example of psychologically healthy homiletics. It operates primarily from the Adult ego state, processing the tension between personal well-being and communal suffering without resorting to guilt-based manipulation (Critical Parent) or simplistic rescue fantasies (Nurturing Parent/Rescuer). By admitting her own 'up' mood and lack of easy answers, the preacher models transparency and invites the listener into a mature, non-defensive faith. The use of the 'communal lament' prevents the 'Ain't It Awful' game by grounding the darkness in a historical and theological framework that leads to agency rather than passivity.",
    "strengths": [

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'we' pronoun to maintain solidarity and prevent the 'Switch' to Persecutor. Keep acknowledging the limits of your own knowledge to prevent the 'ITHY' game."
