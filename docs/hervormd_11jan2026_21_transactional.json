    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of Parent-Child communication. While it aims to be 'liberating' (theologically), it psychologically reinforces dependency. It uses emotional hooks (the Putten razzia) to bypass Adult critical thinking and move the listener into a state of 'brokenness' (Adapted Child) to receive the 'payoff' of grace.",

      "The 'Adult' ego state is often suppressed in favor of emotional manipulation."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as 'Adults' who can make their own choices, rather than 'Children' who are either 'betitched' or 'broken'. Use more 'I-statements' regarding your own struggles with the text rather than 'You-statements' that judge the listener."
