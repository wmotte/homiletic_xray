    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in 'painting the picture' of the Resurrection and the Crucifixion. It moves beyond abstract atonement theories to sensory descriptions of the Shepherd’s lacerated feet and the 'blushing' sky of Easter morning. The preacher uses the 'cinematic' quality advocated by Paul Scott Wilson, particularly in the third section where the grave of Adam and Moses is depicted as shivering under the movement of the 'strong Son of God.' However, some images border on the archaic or overly sentimental, occasionally slipping into 'telling' the emotion rather than letting the image speak for itself. The contrast between the 'gold plates' of Caiaphas and the 'gaudy capes' of modern religionists provides a sharp, visual critique.",
      "quotes": [
        "The sky begins to blush shyly at the love song of the dawning as morning comes.",
        "Until... not until briers cut the Shepherd's hands. But until... not until thorns cut and lacerate the feet.",

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strong 'showing' in the description of the Resurrection; however, the 'telling' dominates the section on atonement theories."

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The language is grand and oratorical but lacks the 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre) regarding precision. It leans heavily on 'Canaanite' dialect and traditional evangelical jargon ('manumitted the slave', 'celestial plains'). While the preacher lists theologians (Anselm, Aquinas, etc.), the treatment of their ideas is superficial, serving more as 'name-dropping' for authority than precise theological engagement. The use of 'perspiring, no, sweating' shows a momentary attempt at precision, but it is quickly lost in a sea of alliteration and repetitive synonyms. The language is designed for emotional impact rather than intellectual or descriptive exactness.",

        "He manumitted the slave's bondage, brought the exile back to his native land.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. It is clearly written for the ear, utilizing the 'musicality' Immink emphasizes. The use of anaphora ('That grave which...') and the rhythmic repetition of 'Christ lives!' creates a liturgical cadence that builds toward a classic 'whooping' or 'climaxing' finish. The sentence structure varies effectively between long, flowing descriptions and staccato declarations. The preacher understands the 'dramaturgy of the voice,' using rhythm to sustain interest even when the content becomes predictable. It avoids 'paper language' entirely, sounding like a living performance.",
      "quotes": [
        "That grave which somewhere in the lonely lost summit of Nebo held Moses begins to shiver.",
        "When I stand on the shores of everlasting deliverance, I shall repeat those words, Christ lives!",

      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The rhythm occasionally becomes so predictable (the 'preacher's cadence') that it risks lulling the hearer into a trance rather than sparking thought.",
        "The final section is perhaps too long in its rhythmic build, bordering on repetitive exhaustion.",
        "Use more 'silence' or pauses in the text to break the relentless flow of the crescendo."

    },
    "average_score_language": 6.67,
    "summary_language": "The sermon's poetics are rooted in the 'Grand Style' of mid-century oratory. It prioritizes musicality and rhythmic impact over linguistic precision. While the imagery is often vivid and 'cinematic'—particularly regarding the Resurrection—it frequently relies on traditional religious metaphors that lack contemporary 'reframing.' The stewardship of language is secondary to the emotional 'event' of the preaching. It is an aesthetically 'loud' sermon that uses language as a percussive instrument to drive home the central kerygma."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear, albeit traditional, chronological plot: Friday, Saturday, Sunday. It begins with a 'homiletical plot' (Lowry) by identifying a problem: the 'chilled' nature of the church and the 'Satanic achievement' of preaching the Resurrection only once a year. This creates an 'upsetting of the equilibrium.' However, the movement through the 'Three Days' is somewhat static. The transition to the 'Second Day' is hesitant and lacks development, while the 'Third Day' is less a narrative progression and more a prolonged rhetorical celebration. The 'turning point' is the Resurrection, but it is presented as a foregone conclusion rather than a dramatic rescue.",
      "quotes": [
        "I want to talk this evening about 'Three Days That Changed the World.'",
        "I leave the second day.",
        "The third day should be in all our preaching all of the time."

      "strengths": [

        "Clear structural markers (First Day, Second Day, Third Day) help the listener follow the journey.",
        "The conclusion successfully brings the 'plot' to a personal, eschatological climax."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'Second Day' section feels like a 'dead end' dramaturgically; it needs more integration or a bolder stance.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The integration of text and context is the sermon's weakest structural point. While it mentions 'Stemmons Freeway' and 'offices,' these are 'pasted on' rather than truly 'reframed' (Cilliers). The biblical world and the modern world remain largely separate blocks. The preacher uses the text as a 'witness' (Long), but the 'reframing' of the hearer's reality is limited to a call for emotional assurance rather than a new way of seeing the world's complexities. The historical examples (Quebec, Texas) are used as illustrations of 'importance' rather than deep contextual synthesis.",
      "quotes": [
        "As you travel along Stemmons Freeway here in Dallas, Christ lives!",

      "reframing_present": "The sermon confirms the old frame (traditional Resurrection faith) rather than offering a surprising new frame for reality."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is a 'closed work of art' (Stark). It is monovalent, driving toward a single, predetermined emotional and dogmatic conclusion. There is little room for the 'ambivalence of existence' or the 'resistance' of the hearer. The preacher even explicitly shuts down exploration of the 'Second Day' ('I shall not [preach a second probation]'). While this provides certainty, it leaves no space for the hearer to 'step into' the text as a participant; they are instead 'overwhelmed' by the preacher's certainty. It is a 'sealed' system of truth.",
      "quotes": [
        "I do not know the meaning of this cryptic passage... and I shall not [preach it].",

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Monovalent and closed; the hearer is a spectator to the preacher's victory march."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 5.0,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is a classic 'Homiletical Plot' that moves from the 'trouble' of Friday to the 'grace' of Sunday. However, it lacks the 'openness' required for a modern aesthetic encounter. The dramaturgy is effective in building emotional energy but fails to achieve a deep synthesis between the ancient text and the contemporary context. It is a 'triumphalist' structure that prioritizes the 'event' of the Resurrection over the 'process' of appropriation."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 4,
    "analysis": "The sermon contains significant elements of religious kitsch. Cilliers defines kitsch as 'pre-chewed emotions' and 'cheap solutions.' The rapid move from the 'crimes I have done' to 'amazing pity' without exploring the weight of those crimes, and the romanticized imagery of the 'blushing sky,' are hallmarks of homiletical kitsch. The 'happy ending' is guaranteed from the first paragraph, which prevents a true encounter with the 'pain of suffering.' However, the preacher’s mention of his own surgery and the 'testing time' provides a brief moment of authentic depth that saves the sermon from being pure sentiment.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'blushing sky' and 'love song of the dawning'—overly sentimentalized nature imagery.",
      "The 'happy ending' of the 'crossing password' which resolves the terror of death too cleanly."

      "The admission of 'strange sadness' for lost kin, though quickly suppressed."

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 5,
    "analysis": "Space is 'opened' for grace in the sense that the Resurrection is presented as a gift, not a task. However, space is 'closed' by the preacher's rhetorical dominance and the moralistic rejection of theological mystery (the 'Second Day'). The 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) requires room for the 'not yet' and the 'despair,' but this sermon is so focused on the 'already' that the tension of the human condition is largely dissolved. It offers 'grace' as a finished product rather than an 'opening' into the mystery of God's presence.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are cheaply resolved; the 'trouble' of Friday is immediately swallowed by the 'forgiving tree'.",
    "mystery_respected": "Mystery is acknowledged but then quickly 'left behind' in favor of dogmatic certainty.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails over moralization (the sermon is not 'legalistic'), but it is a 'triumphalist' grace that leaves little room for the 'praying person' in distress.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'Friday' of the sermon to be truly dark, without the 'Sunday' light shining through too early. This creates a larger 'space' for the grace of the Resurrection to act."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 5.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a prime example of the 'Aesthetic of the Event' (Immink) and the 'Grand Oratorical Style.' Its strength lies in its performative musicality and its ability to create a sense of 'happening' through rhythm and repetition. Aesthetically, it functions as a 'monument'—solid, imposing, and certain. However, from the perspective of the 'Aesthetic Turn,' it suffers from being a 'closed work.' It relies on traditional imagery that, while vivid, often slips into kitsch by avoiding the raw 'Inter-esse' (Cilliers) of human suffering and doubt. The preacher acts as a 'narrator' rather than a 'witness' (Long), leading the congregation through a pre-packaged emotional journey. While it is a powerful rhetorical performance, it lacks the 'sober beauty' and 'openness' that characterizes the best of contemporary homiletic aesthetics.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rhetorical rhythm and musicality (Domain A3).",
      "Vivid, cinematic imagery of the Resurrection (Domain A1).",

    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals most to traditional believers seeking emotional assurance and 'sober-yet-grand' liturgical celebration.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with 'Show, Don't Tell' in the theological sections—don't just name 'atonement theories,' describe the human need they meet.",
      "Incorporate more 'silence' and 'open questions' into the structure to allow the 'Holy' to happen in the hearer's mind.",
      "Avoid 'Canaanite' jargon in favor of 'Stewardship of Language'—use words that are fresh and 'un-pre-chewed'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically 'competent' example of traditional evangelical oratory (Score: 5.8). It succeeds as a performance and a rhythmic event but fails as an 'open work of art.' It prioritizes the 'beauty of certainty' over the 'beauty of the cross' (which includes the ugly and the unresolved). To move toward a 7 or 8, the preacher would need to sacrifice some rhetorical polish for the sake of authentic 'reframing' and 'space for grace.'"
