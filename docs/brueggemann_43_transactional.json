    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely game-free. It avoids the common trap of the Critical Parent (moralizing) and instead uses the Adult ego state to validate the Child's fears. By acknowledging that prayer can be 'manipulative' and 'bold,' the preacher grants the listener permission to be authentic rather than 'adapted' (polite). The movement from nightmare to dancing promotes emotional fluidity and autonomy.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'morning joy' resolution could be seen as a 'Con' if not carefully balanced with the reality of chronic suffering.",
      "Slight risk of 'Ain't It Awful' in the section on national nightmares."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize that the 'morning' is a gift of God and not a guaranteed result of the 'technique' of shrill prayer to avoid falling into a 'Magic Shop' game."
