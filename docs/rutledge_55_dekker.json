  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon focuses on the pericope of the widow of Zarephath. However, it spends significant time on the general persona of Elijah (v. 1) and the Transfiguration, which are outside the specific text. It identifies the 'uniqueness' of the passage in the audacity of Elijah's prayer, but leans heavily on general Pauline theology to explain the widow's reaction.",
      "quotes": [
        "Elijah’s way of announcing himself was, 'As the Lord the God of Israel lives, before whom I stand …' (1 Kings 17:1).",
        "Where does Elijah get the idea that he can rage against God and then demand that God roll back his own decision?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more exclusively on the specific interaction between the widow and Elijah in this house. What is in *this* specific miracle that is not in the raising of the son of the Shunammite (2 Kings 4)?"
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher understands the historical context (Ahab/Jezebel/Baalism) but the exegesis is largely narrative-driven rather than philological. There is no mention of the Hebrew nuances or the specific cultural weight of a widow's status in the Ancient Near East beyond 'destitute'.",
      "quotes": [
        "God was sending Elijah to a district where Jezebel had been raised, where the name of YHWH was not honored.",
        "The boy’s death in the presence of God’s servant Elijah causes the woman to surmise that the prophet came to her for judgment."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate deeper linguistic or historical-critical insights into the 'word of the Lord' (v. 24) to justify the claim of 'exposition' as defined by Dekker."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The application remains somewhat abstract or historical. While it mentions Idi Amin and Nelson Mandela, these serve more as illustrations of 'great men' than as concrete applications for the specific congregation in New York. The application of 'sin and death' is dogmatic rather than psychologically concrete.",
      "quotes": [
        "In South Africa today, it is Nelson Mandela. In America, black families display portraits of Martin Luther King.",
        "We are under sentence of death, all of us."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'misery' of the modern hearer more concrete. How does the 'judgment' of God's presence manifest in a 1983 New York context specifically?"
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon successfully avoids the 'block' structure. It moves between the narrative of 1 Kings and the human experience of feeling judged by holiness. The hearer is drawn into the widow's hut.",
      "quotes": [
        "Often, this is an irritant, and we want to get away from that person... In a similar way, Elijah... was not an easy person to be with."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'application' doesn't just jump to Paul's letters, but stays within the movement of the text's own logic."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The three parts are present. Misery is identified as the 'sentence of death' and the 'remembrance of sin'. Redemption is the life-giving word. Gratitude is seen in the widow's confession. However, the 'misery' is treated more as a theological fact than a felt reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!",
        "Now I know that the word of the Lord from your mouth is truth."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by exploring the widow's anger as a legitimate psychological state before God, as Dekker suggests for Psalm 88."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The 'two ways' are present in the distinction between the 'dead idols' and the 'living God', and the choice between life and death. However, the 'seriousness of being lost' is softened by a focus on general human frailty.",
      "quotes": [
        "The promise that we may grasp and believe is that God’s judgment will for us be life, and not death; mercy, and not condemnation."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'temporal loss' more sharply. What does it mean for the hearer to 'perish' today if they do not stand before the living God?"
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "The sermon is strongly Christocentric. Christ is the telos. The preacher links the widow of Zarephath to the widow of Nain and the Transfiguration, making Christ the ultimate fulfillment of the 'life through death' pattern.",
      "quotes": [
        "Christ is the telos of the sermon... they saw no man, save Jesus only."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Be careful not to let Christology 'override' the specific Old Testament text too early; let the text's own witness to God's character speak before jumping to the New Testament."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "At over 2000 words, the sermon meets Dekker's requirement for 'breadth'. It allows the narrative to breathe and explores the theological implications of the text's drama.",
      "improvement_point": "Maintain this breadth but ensure it serves the 'specific' word of the text rather than general biblical themes."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a solid homiletical exercise that respects the narrative flow of Scripture and maintains a clear Christological focus. However, it falls short of Dekker's 'specific' requirement by relying on general Pauline categories (Sin/Death) to interpret the widow's grief rather than extracting the unique 'truth' found only in this passage. The application to the zeitgeist is present but lacks the 'sharpness' and 'concreteness' Dekker demands.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christological telos that connects the Old and New Testaments without being forced.",
      "Effective interwovenness of narrative exposition and theological reflection.",
      "Adequate length to allow for theological depth."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specific philological exegesis (Hebrew/Greek context).",
      "Application remains too general/historical (Mandela/Amin) rather than addressing the immediate congregation's spiritual reality.",
      "The 'misery' of the widow is quickly subsumed into a general dogmatic category of 'Sin'."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition, particularly in its formal structure and Christological aim. However, it requires more 'sober' and 'specific' attention to the unique voice of the 1 Kings text to reach the level of 'true truth' that Dekker envisions."
