  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a solid exegetical framework based on John 21. He correctly identifies the threefold restoration of Peter as a parallel to the threefold denial. A significant 'blue' contribution is the rejection of Alexander Maclaren’s comparative interpretation ('more than these' disciples) in favor of a material interpretation ('more than these' fishing tools). This moves the 'Sache' from a competition of piety to a question of vocational priority. However, the theological depth remains largely at the level of narrative retelling. While Barth would appreciate the focus on Christ as the initiator of the conversation, the sermon lacks a rigorous dogmatic exploration of the nature of 'Agape' versus 'Phileo', which is often a staple of this text. The factual side serves primarily as a springboard for the relational and personal narrative rather than an independent intellectual pillar.",
      "quotes": [
        "He was not pitting people, one against the other.",
        "Simon, do you love me more than all of this fishing gear...",
        "Jesus did not put this question to Simon until they had finished eating."

        "Lacks engagement with the Greek nuances of the text which would bolster the 'blue' side."

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The language is simple, and the metaphors (keys, fishing gear) are universally understood."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The green side is the sermon's strongest engine. The preacher reveals himself as a son, a pastor who has wrestled with legal systems, and a believer who has known deep grief. There is a high degree of transparency regarding his own 'scared ignorance' (the jar of keys) and his childhood vulnerability. The self-revelation is not 'image management' but a genuine 'Selbstenthüllung'. He admits to being 'tired and a little disgusted' in his past ministry, which builds immense credibility. The 'I' in this sermon is not an ego-monument but a witness to the 'Who' he preaches. It is a diaconal use of the self, though it borders on the 'hysterical' type in its dramatic narrative structure, yet it remains anchored in the service of the congregation's comfort.",

        "I have at my house a jar full of keys. I don't know what they fit. But I'm scared.",

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive/Hysterical hybrid. The preacher seeks harmony and closeness (Depressive) through the use of emotional, stage-aware storytelling (Hysterical) to bridge the gap between pulpit and pew.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is subservient; the personal stories are used as 'parables' of the Gospel rather than self-aggrandizement.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Solidary'. The preacher speaks as one who is 'in the storm' with the congregation. He uses 'we' and 'us' frequently, creating a communal space of shared struggle. However, there is a sharp 'yellow' moment where he confronts the congregation's excuses for leaving the church ('they give so many lies to us'). Here, the relationship shifts from 'comforter' to 'truth-teller'. He challenges the hearer's honesty, which creates a necessary tension. The tone is paternal yet brotherly. He defines the congregation not as 'objects of a lecture' but as 'sheep' in need of feeding, placing himself in the role of the under-shepherd who understands their 'despondency'.",
      "quotes": [
        "And you and I ought to be very careful about making comparisons.",
        "Tell the truth about it, for love is the crucial answer!",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily an invitation to 'Love' as the solution to life's locks. The 'red' side is interesting because it oscillates between a demand (Anspruch) to 'tell the truth' and a promise (Zuspruch) that 'the Lord will make a way'. Theologically, the sermon risks moralism by suggesting that 'if you can get that central matter [love] straight, everything else... will fall in place.' This can sound like a psychological demand: 'Love harder to fix your life.' However, the final third of the sermon shifts heavily toward the 'Zuspruch' of God's providence. The 'Who' (God's action) eventually eclipses the 'How' (human effort).",
      "quotes": [
        "Tell the truth about it, for love is the crucial answer!",
        "I've got a job for you to do... Feed my sheep.",

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Starts with a heavy 'Anspruch' (Love the Lord!) but ends with a dominant 'Zuspruch' (The Lord will make a way).",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Moderate. The idea that love is the 'key' we must turn can feel like a burden if the listener feels unable to produce that love.",
      "strengths": [
        "The appeal is rooted in a person (Christ) rather than a program.",
        "Strong call to social action (feeding the hungry)."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Clarify that the ability to love is also a gift from God, not just a human 'key'.",
        "Reduce the pressure of 'everything will work out if you love' to avoid prosperity-gospel undertones."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a powerful, rhetorically skilled sermon that exemplifies the 'Black Preaching' tradition's ability to fuse personal narrative with biblical truth. From a Schulz von Thun perspective, the preacher uses the 'Green' side (Self-revelation) as his primary communicative bridge, making the 'Blue' (Factual) content live through the lens of his own biography. Theologically, it follows the tradition of Gerrit Immink by emphasizing God as the 'Acting Subject' (the 'Who') in the face of human 'How'. While it flirts with psychologization by making 'love' the 'key' (suggesting a human psychological state unlocks divine favor), it redeems itself in the Barthian sense by pointing away from the preacher's own 'how' to the objective faithfulness of the Lord. The 'Yellow' (Relational) aspect is handled with a masterful mix of pastoral warmth and prophetic sharpness. The sermon's greatest strength is its congruence; the preacher does not hide behind the pulpit but stands before the congregation as a fellow traveler. Its slight weakness lies in a potential 'Appeal' overload where love is presented as a task before it is presented as a gift.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a risk of 'Erlebnis-theology' where the mother's faith and the preacher's feelings become the primary evidence for God, potentially overshadowing the 'Extra Nos' of the Word.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Masterful use of narrative and personal testimony.",
      "Effective 'Who vs. How' theological pivot.",
      "Strong integration of social gospel and spiritual restoration."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Deepen the 'Blue' side with more rigorous theological definitions of love.",
      "Soften the 'Red' appeal to avoid the 'Law of Love' becoming a new burden.",
      "Ensure the transition from 'scolding' to 'comforting' is more homiletically fluid."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, congruent sermon that successfully uses psychological intimacy to deliver a traditional message of divine providence."
