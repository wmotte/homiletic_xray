    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and promotes autonomy. It avoids the typical 'Parent-Child' trap of religious discourse by validating doubt and emphasizing the 'Adult' responsibility for social justice. By integrating the 'Free Child' (imagination/play) with the 'Adult' (reality testing), it creates a space for authentic faith that does not require the suppression of intellect or emotion.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I-messages' regarding faith and doubt. Maintain the 'Adult-Adult' invitation by acknowledging that your political interpretations are also 'interpretations' rather than absolute dogmas."
