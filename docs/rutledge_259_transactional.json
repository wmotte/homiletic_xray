    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a masterclass in 'Ain't It Awful' and 'Nurturing-but-Strict Parent' dynamics. While intellectually stimulating and 'theologically correct' in a traditional sense, it psychologically maneuvers the listener into a state of Adapted Child fear and dependency on the preacher's 'fearless inventory.' It creates an 'in-group' of those who can handle the dark versus the 'out-group' who need scented candles, which fosters spiritual pride (a common TA payoff). However, it scores points for its strong Adult appeal to reality and its final call to service.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to invite the congregation into the 'Darkness' as an Adult choice rather than a Parent-enforced requirement. Instead of shaming the desire for 'glitter,' explore it as a Free Child's natural response to fear, then offer the 'Armor of Light' as an Adult tool for the here-and-now."
