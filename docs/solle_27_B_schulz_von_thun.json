    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon provides a solid socio-historical exegesis of the Corinthian conflict. Schottroff correctly identifies the 'unworthy' participation not as a psychological state of sinfulness, but as a social transgression of class boundaries (Gerstenbrei vs. Fische). The theological 'Sache' is the 'Leib Christi' as a social reality. However, from a Barthian perspective, the 'blue' side is heavily tilted towards horizontal sociology. The vertical dimension of the Sacrament as God's sovereign action is largely replaced by the human action of 'sharing'. The exegesis serves the political agenda, risking a reduction of the Gospel to a social ethic. The clarity is high, but the dogmatic depth regarding the 'Real Presence' is sacrificed for social immanence.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preachers reveal themselves as 'grandmothers' of the movement, blending personal biography with political passion. There is a high degree of transparency regarding their own longings and frustrations (e.g., Schottroff's admission of loneliness as a single). The 'I' is prominent but largely diaconal, aiming to model a 'lived faith'. However, there is a certain 'Hysterical' (in the Riemann sense) tendency to use the pulpit as a stage for personal travelogues (California, Seattle) to validate theological points. The authenticity is palpable, yet the 'green' side occasionally overshadows the text by making the preachers' experiences the primary source of authority.",

        "Ich will eins meiner schönsten Kirchenerlebnisse hier erzählen",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'solidary' and 'at eye level'. The preachers position themselves as part of the 'we' (the searching, suffering church). However, there is a subtle 'paternalistic' (or maternalistic) undertone in the way they instruct the congregation on how to feel (e.g., 'should be joyful'). The 'yellow' side creates a warm, inclusive atmosphere, but the 'relationship noise' arises for those who do not share the specific political-theological milieu. The 'We-definition' is strong but potentially exclusive to those who find the 'politicization of mercy' jarring. The tone is inviting yet intellectually demanding in its moral expectations.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily appeal-driven. The ratio between 'Zuspruch' (Promise) and 'Anspruch' (Demand) is problematic. While they argue for joy, the joy is immediately tied to 'common work for justice'. The Gospel (Gift) is almost entirely translated into a Task (Law). The 'red' side dominates the conclusion with a specific political appeal (Jubilee 2000/Debt relief). While theologically grounded in the 'Erlassjahr', it risks moralism. The hearer is left with a 'to-do list' (City Hall, debt relief, ecological awareness) rather than the 'rest' of the Gospel. The 'healing' is something humans must 'do' for God to 'happen'.",

        "You have to go to City Hall!",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.2,
    "summary": "This dialogue sermon is a classic example of late 20th-century Political Theology. It succeeds in making the biblical text relevant by stripping away 'mystical' layers and revealing the social core of the Eucharist. The communication is authentic and courageous. However, from a homiletical standpoint, it suffers from an 'Appeal-overload'. The Barthian warning is acute here: God is at risk of becoming a predicate of human social action ('God happens where...'). The sacrament is instrumentalized for 'Erneuerung der Kirche' (Church renewal) through ethics. While the psychological 'Yellow' side is warm, the 'Red' side places a heavy burden on the listener. The 'Blue' side is intellectually stimulating but serves the 'Red' side too subserviently. It is a 'Satisfactory' to 'Ample Satisfactory' performance that lacks the 'Sabbath rest' of the Gospel, favoring the 'Workday' of activism.",
    "barthian_warning": "High risk of psychologization and sociologization. God is presented as the 'result' of human sharing rather than the 'Subject' who shares Himself.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Radical relevance to global issues.",
      "Deconstruction of religious fear.",
      "Authentic, vulnerable personal witness."

    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Restore the ontological priority of Grace over Action.",
      "Balance the political 'Anspruch' with more liturgical 'Zuspruch'.",
      "Reduce the 'Hysterical' reliance on personal travel anecdotes."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A powerful socio-political manifesto that functions well as a 'Bibelarbeit' but falls short of the full 'Gospel promise' by making the table of the Lord a table of political mobilization."
