  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a masterclass in existential confrontation. While it uses high-level Adult processing to engage the listener, it psychologically functions by stripping the listener of defenses (Critical Parent) and inducing a state of 'learned helplessness' (Adapted Child). This creates a vacuum that only the 'Rescuer' (Christ/The Church's Liturgy) can fill. While theologically orthodox in its focus on grace, the psychological delivery relies on a 'crushing' of the human ego to validate the divine intervention, which can create dependency rather than autonomous faith.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Heavy use of 'must' and 'should' regarding how one feels about death.",
      "The 'pathetic human' rhetoric may trigger shame rather than reflection.",
      "The 'No Choice' theology (Lazarus had no choice) reinforces a passive Victim role for the listener."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to invite the listener's 'Free Child' into the joy of the Resurrection earlier. Instead of using the Adult ego to 'trap' the listener into a corner of helplessness, use it to explore how the 'Adult' can live responsibly in the face of mortality without needing to be 'crushed' first."
