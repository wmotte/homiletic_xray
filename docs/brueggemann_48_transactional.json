    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of manipulative games. By operating primarily from the Adult ego state, the preacher respects the listener's autonomy. He uses the 'Drama' of the text (the Psalmist's envy) to mirror the listener's experience without falling into the Drama Triangle himself. The transition from 'Commodity' to 'Communion' is presented as an internal psychological and spiritual shift ('coming to oneself') rather than a result of external pressure.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The intellectual depth might occasionally bypass the 'Free Child's' need for simple, visceral imagery.",
      "The critique of 'Empire' could risk becoming 'Ain't It Awful' if not balanced by the personal 'Until' moment."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize the 'mystery' of the 'Until' moment, as this prevents the preacher from becoming a 'Rescuer' with a 'Gimmick' or a 'Con'."
