      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon lacks a singular, immersive 'slice of life' or a specific narrative hook. Instead of a concrete experience, it opens with an abstract theological concept from Paul Tillich. While it mentions global locations (Boston, Birmingham, Lagos), these function more as rhetorical markers than as sites for emotional identification. The 'feeling' level is addressed through the shared experience of social struggle, but it remains at a distance, described rather than felt.",

    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of the Declarative-Visionary style, characterized by intellectual depth and rhetorical power. It functions primarily in the 'Assimilating' quadrant of Kolb's cycle, excelling in Abstract Conceptualization and Reflective Observation. The preacher provides a masterful deconstruction of the logic of oppression and a robust biblical framework for freedom as a divine mandate. However, the sermon falls short in providing a Concrete Experience that allows for immediate emotional identification, and it lacks specific Active Experimentation. The 'how' of the Christian life is subsumed under the 'what' and the 'why'. It is a sermon that informs the mind and inspires the soul but leaves the hands largely idle. The language is sophisticated and the logic is sound, but the lack of practical handles and personal narrative makes it a 'top-heavy' learning experience.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "From a Kolb perspective, this sermon is a highly developed intellectual exercise that successfully moves the hearer through the 'Reflective' and 'Conceptual' phases of learning. It is a 'Sage' and 'Prophet' sermon that excels in interpreting the times and declaring God's norms. However, as a holistic learning event, it is incomplete. The absence of a concrete 'hook' and the lack of specific, actionable application means that while the hearer's worldview may be expanded, their behavior is not directly challenged or coached. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'sublime emancipation' of the cross and the 'blood and toil' of daily community building through more pragmatic and concrete homiletical moves."
