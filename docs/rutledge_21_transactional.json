    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of Parent-Child homiletics. While theologically orthodox in its emphasis on sovereignty, it psychologically functions by stripping the listener of Adult agency. It uses 'shame-baiting' (pointing out troubled marriages/careers) to force a 'switch' into a state of helplessness. The narrative of the grieving father is powerful but is used to reinforce a 'Victim' position that can only be solved by total surrender to an external 'King,' rather than fostering a mature, Adult faith that co-operates with the Divine.",

      "Over-reliance on Critical Parent judgments of 'modernity.'",
      "Manipulative use of personal failure (marriage/career) to score theological points.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult invitation for the listener to process the 'scandal' themselves."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as fellow Adults who can choose to follow the King out of Free Child joy rather than Adapted Child fear. Avoid using the listener's potential personal 'failures' as a Gimmick to prove a theological point."
