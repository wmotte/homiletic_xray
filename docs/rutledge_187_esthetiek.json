    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating 'cinematic' moments, particularly in the opening analogy of the desperate parent. This aligns with Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' principle. The imagery of the 'last ditch of our messed-up lives' and the 'watchman straining for the dawn' provides concrete anchors for abstract theological concepts like grace and hope. However, the imagery occasionally leans toward the familiar (lost sheep, light/radiance), which prevents a higher score. The strength lies in the visceral description of parental desperation—mortgaging the house, losing sleep—which 'paints the picture' of Paul’s apostolic agony and, by extension, God's pursuing love. It effectively avoids the 'dry scholarly' tone it critiques by grounding the Trinity in relational 'inter-esse' (Cilliers).",
      "quotes": [
        "You would spend huge amounts of money for professional help; you would fly across the country; you would pay a ransom, mortgage the house...",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise, reflecting McEntyre’s 'stewardship of language.' The preacher carefully distinguishes between 'Something' and 'Someone,' and 'sentiment' versus 'fear of the Lord.' There is a deliberate effort to rescue 'Canaanite' terms (sin, Trinity, redemption) from being clichés by re-contextualizing them within human experience and liturgical history. The critique of the Prayer Book's linguistic shifts demonstrates a high level of concern for how specific words ('no health in us') shape theological reality. The vocabulary is sophisticated yet accessible, avoiding academic obscurity while maintaining intellectual rigor. Every word feels weighted with intention, particularly in the description of God's 'uncalculating' love.",
      "quotes": [
        "This is no dry scholarly doctrine... Nor is this a vague, romanticized version of human love.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The text exhibits a clear rhetorical cadence, likely born from a deep immersion in the Book of Common Prayer. There is a rhythmic use of triads ('without restraint, without measure, without calculation') which aids in oral delivery and emphasis. The sentence structure varies effectively between long, descriptive sequences and short, punchy declarations. The use of alliteration ('devices and desires', 'bigots and thugs') and parallelism creates a sense of 'flow' that Immink associates with the 'happening' of the Word. It is clearly 'oral language' rather than 'paper language,' designed to be heard and felt in a liturgical space. The rhythm slows down appropriately during the reflective sections on human suffering.",

    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The sermon displays a high level of micro-aesthetic quality. It avoids the 'beautifying writing' trap by using language that is both aesthetically pleasing and theologically sharp. The imagery is grounded in human pathos, and the precision of word choice reflects a deep 'stewardship of language.' The musicality is rooted in the Anglican tradition, providing a dignified yet urgent rhythm. It successfully 'reframes' abstract dogmas (Trinity, Sin) into living realities through careful, sensory, and rhythmic prose."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes a 'Lowry-esque' upsetting of equilibrium by starting with a crisis (the self-destructing child). This creates immediate tension. The movement from Paul’s 'agonized' state to the 'full Trinitarian blessing' serves as a clear narrative arc. However, the second section (Psalm 130) follows a more traditional thematic structure. While it moves from 'depths' to 'dawn,' the progression feels more like a commentary than a journey. The 'turning point' in the first section is the realization that the blessing is for the 'heartbreaking' church, which is a strong dramaturgical move. The second section's arc is slightly flatter, relying on the inherent movement of the Psalm rather than a newly constructed homiletical plot.",
      "quotes": [
        "Imagine for a moment that you are the parent of a child... who appears to be on the verge of self-destruction.",
        "The church that was breaking his heart is the one that gets the full Trinitarian blessing.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a primary strength. The preacher 'reframes' (Cilliers) the biblical text by placing it in a surprising context—Paul's 'desperation' rather than a dry liturgical formula. The integration of the 1976 Prayer Book controversy provides a concrete contemporary 'context' that allows the hearer to see the theological stakes of language. The sermon respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the 'fear of the Lord') and refuses to smooth it over with modern psychological comfort. Instead, it forces a synthesis where the 'vast primordial catastrophe' of sin meets the 'inexhaustible' love of God. It avoids the 'springboard' trap by staying deeply tethered to the specific wording of the epistles and psalms.",
      "quotes": [
        "The last four chapters of 2 Corinthians form the most agonized portion of the New Testament.",
        "The removal of this line has robbed us of a powerful buttress to the biblical concept of sin...",

        "Ensure the 'reframing' of the Trinity doesn't become too 'domestic' despite the parental analogy."

      "reframing_present": "Yes; it successfully reframes the Trinity from a 'dry doctrine' to an 'act of desperation' and sin from 'rule-breaking' to 'catastrophe'."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is 'open' in its invitation to reflection ('Reflect on your own life'), but 'closed' in its theological certainty. While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (parents who fail, the 'messed-up' life), the conclusions are quite definitive. Following Ciska Stark, it functions as an 'open work' by allowing hearers to find their own 'someone' who loved them, but it leans toward a 'closed' system in its liturgical declarations. The ending is a traditional benediction, which provides resolution rather than leaving the hearer with a lingering question. It is more 'monovalent' in its proclamation of grace, though 'polyvalent' in its application to human suffering.",
      "quotes": [
        "Think of those who did not seem to have much self-regard as they poured all their resources into you...",
        "May God grant that not a single one of us today would think himself too good...",

        "Consider ending with a question or an image that lingers rather than a definitive 'And so...'.",
        "Allow more room for the 'resistance' (Stark) a hearer might feel toward the concept of being a 'miserable offender'."

      "open_work_diagnosis": "Moderately open; it invites participation but maintains a strong, authoritative 'witness' stance (Long)."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is solid, characterized by a strong 'witness' perspective. The integration of text and context is the structural highlight, providing a 'reframing' that makes old texts feel urgent. The narrative arc is strongest in the first half, while the second half settles into a more traditional (though profound) liturgical commentary. While it opens space for the hearer's experience, the sermon remains firmly rooted in a declarative, authoritative structure that prioritizes the 'proclamation of grace' over 'open-ended exploration'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It explicitly critiques 'vague, romanticized' versions of love and 'cheerful, domestic' ideas of God. By insisting on the 'crabbed' and 'agonized' nature of Paul's writing and the 'vast primordial catastrophe' of sin, it avoids the 'happy ending' cliché. Cilliers' warning against kitsch—pre-chewed emotions—is heeded here; the comfort offered is 'hard-won' because it first acknowledges the 'stench' of the 'last ditch.' The parental analogy is saved from kitsch by the inclusion of 'parents who failed us.' It prioritizes 'authentic emotion' (despair, majesty) over 'sentiment' (niceness).",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The phrase 'glimmer of the full radiance' is the closest the text comes to a cliché, but it is anchored in a discussion of 'fallen worlds'.",

      "The acknowledgment that for some, parents were the source of failure, not love.",

    "recommendation": "Maintain the 'sharpness' of the human predicament to ensure the 'sweetness' of grace never becomes saccharine."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is a textbook example of 'opening space for grace.' It does this by first 'clearing the ground' of moralism and 'petty record keeping.' By framing God's love as 'uncalculating' and 'without measure,' it removes the 'coercive schema' of worthiness. The tension between 'despair' and 'hope' is sustained—the 'depths' are not explained away but are the very location where grace appears. It respects the mystery of the Trinity by defining it as 'dynamic interrelatedness' rather than a mathematical puzzle, thus leaving room for the 'Holy to happen' (Immink).",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes; the tension between human 'self-destruction' and divine 'pursuit' is the engine of the sermon.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes; the Trinity is presented as an inexhaustible relational mystery.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails entirely; moralization is explicitly 'decisively repudiated'.",
    "recommendation": "To further open space, allow for a moment of 'silence' or 'unknowing' within the text regarding the 'how' of redemption."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a sophisticated aesthetic achievement within the Reformed/Anglican tradition. It avoids the 'aestheticism' of mere beauty by ensuring that every rhetorical flourish serves the radicality of the Gospel. The 'Poetics of Language' are strong, characterized by a 'sober beauty' and a high degree of linguistic stewardship. The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long), painting a vivid picture of the divine-human drama. The 'Dramaturgy' is effective, particularly in its ability to 'reframe' familiar liturgical elements as matters of life and death. While the structure is somewhat traditional and the 'openness' is tempered by a strong declarative theology, the sermon succeeds in creating a 'space for grace' that is both intellectually rigorous and emotionally authentic. It avoids kitsch by refusing to minimize the 'depths' of the human condition, making the subsequent proclamation of the Trinity and redemption feel earned and weighty. The aesthetic power lies in the 'tension of the between'—between the 'miserable offender' and the 'incomparable glory of God.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Reframing of the Trinitarian benediction as an act of apostolic desperation.",
      "Linguistic precision and the 'rescue' of traditional theological terms from cliché.",

      "Structural integration between the two distinct liturgical sections.",
      "Greater use of 'open' endings or lingering questions to increase polyvalence.",

    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Liturgical-Dramatic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Thomas Long's 'Witness' model and Johan Cilliers' 'Reframing' and 'Space for Grace' approach.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'mature' hearers who value intellectual honesty, liturgical tradition, and a refusal of 'cheap' comfort.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'narrative' structure for the entire length of the sermon.",
      "Incorporate more 'secular' imagery to bridge the gap for those outside the liturgical tradition.",
      "Use more 'staccato' rhythms in the theological sections to increase oral impact."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically 'strong' sermon (7.5) that serves as an excellent example of how to combine high-church liturgical sensitivity with the 'aesthetic turn's' emphasis on perception and reframing. It is a work of 'sober beauty' that directs attention away from the preacher's skill and toward the 'incomprehensible majesty' of God. It successfully avoids the pitfalls of both dry dogmatism and shallow sentimentality."
