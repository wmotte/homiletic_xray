    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of transactional games. It maintains an Adult-Adult posture by validating the listener's reality (doubt, grief, the 'dust' of existence) before presenting the theological claim. It avoids the 'Drama Triangle' by refusing to play the Rescuer with easy answers. The preacher’s self-disclosure of his own struggle further levels the playing field, promoting the listener's autonomy.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements regarding faith struggles to maintain the Adult-Adult connection and prevent the congregation from slipping into an 'Adapted Child' role of performative belief."
