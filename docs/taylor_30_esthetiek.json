    "sermon_start_end": "Do you not find it strange that the world cannot get over Calvary and the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth? There were other events in the life of Jesus, the tense and mighty drama of temptation, the calling of the Twelve, the healing miracles, the Sermon on the Mount... [...] Standing there at Calvary, musing upon it, bowing the head and opening the heart, we know something has been done for us that nobody but Jesus could do. We reach for figures and metaphors. There the old account is settled. There the separating veil is torn in two. There the prisoner's cell door swings wide. There is something about that lonely, lightless hill called Calvary which delivers us.",

    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes strong, evocative imagery that moves beyond abstract dogma into sensory reality. The preacher effectively 'paints' the scene of Calvary not through gore, but through the emotional and physical weight of the event. The use of the spiritual 'Were you there' serves as a primary auditory and emotional image. The contrast between the 'well-groomed' appearance of sin and the 'hideous quality' it reveals at the cross provides a sharp visual juxtaposition. However, some metaphors like 'last fatal plunge' or 'final thrust' border on the conventional, though they remain effective in context. The imagery of the 'prisoner's cell door' at the end provides a concrete closing visual for the abstract concept of deliverance.",

        "the spirituals of my own people have many haunting moods and tunes that touch the heart",

        "Some metaphors for God's action ('thrust', 'plunge') are slightly repetitive.",

        "Could benefit from more concrete imagery regarding the 'laughter and feasts' of Jesus' life to contrast the cross."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "The sermon leans toward 'showing' through the lens of the spirituals and the description of sin's social masks, though it 'tells' the theological significance of the incarnation quite directly in the middle section."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is remarkably precise and avoids the 'Canaanite jargon' that often plagues Passion sermons. The preacher redefines 'sin' using contemporary, recognizable terms ('go-getter', 'sharp dealer', 'stylish'), which demonstrates a high level of stewardship of language as defined by McEntyre. The phrasing is economical; there is a rhythmic 'terse leanness' that the preacher explicitly praises in the Gospel writers and then emulates. The choice of adjectives ('ponderous', 'flabby', 'purple') shows a self-conscious aesthetic rejection of oratorical excess in favor of clarity and truth-telling.",
      "quotes": [
        "no flabby phrases, any ponderous passages, any purple and florid oratory.",
        "this sinfulness as something annoying, maybe, but not really bad.",
        "the kind of cheap compromising with principle which you and I practice"

      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition to 'these last brief words' is a common homiletical trope that could be more creative.",
        "The term 'God-man' is a traditional dogmatic shorthand that feels slightly more 'paper-like' than the surrounding prose.",
        "The reference to 'spiritual reinforcement' is slightly clinical compared to the poetic 'legions of angels'."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "The sermon successfully deconstructs traditional jargon. 'Sin' is not left as a religious abstraction but is precisely mapped onto social and personal behaviors."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a natural cadence and oral rhythm. The use of repetition ('tremble, tremble, tremble', 'strong enough, brave enough, cared enough') creates a liturgical flow that aids the listener's engagement. There is a clear variation in sentence length—short, punchy sentences for emphasis ('He did save others because he would not save himself') and longer, flowing sentences for reflection. The rhythm of the final paragraph, with its repetitive 'There the...', creates a sense of resolution and 'legato' that mirrors the peace of the gospel described.",
      "quotes": [
        "Oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble.",
        "He saved others. Let him save himself.",

        "The middle section on the incarnation is slightly more dense and loses some of the rhythmic drive of the opening.",

    },
    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits high micro-aesthetic quality. It avoids the 'purple oratory' it critiques, opting instead for a 'terse leanness' that is both precise and evocative. By grounding the imagery in the African American spiritual tradition and contemporary social masks of sin, the preacher achieves a 'sober beauty'. The language is careful, avoiding religious clichés in favor of fresh, diagnostic descriptions of the human condition. The rhythm is particularly strong in the opening and closing, facilitating a deep emotional resonance without falling into sentimentality."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' as described by Lowry. It begins with an 'upsetting of the equilibrium'—the strange persistence of Calvary in a world that should have moved on. It moves through a series of 'looks' (reframing) that increase the tension by exposing the 'hideous' nature of sin. The turning point is found in the prayer of Jesus for his tormentors, shifting the energy from the 'ugly mystery' of sin to the 'triumphant assurance' of grace. The movement is dynamic, though the 'three looks' structure risks becoming a static list, it is saved by the cumulative emotional weight of the descriptions.",
      "quotes": [
        "Do you not find it strange that the world cannot get over Calvary...?",
        "Still another look at Calvary shows us the mystery of triumphant assurance.",
        "Now these last brief words. I cannot explain it all."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The opening creates immediate curiosity and existential tension.",
        "The transition from the 'ugly mystery' to the 'triumphant assurance' is well-timed.",
        "The conclusion provides a sense of arrival and release."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'three looks' structure is a bit traditional; a more integrated narrative flow could enhance the 'event' quality.",
        "The section on the incarnation feels like a theological detour that slows the narrative momentum toward the cross.",
        "The connection between the 'actor off Broadway' and the main theme could be more tightly integrated."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey that uses a 'reframing' technique to move the listener from curiosity to conviction to comfort."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a masterclass in Cilliers' 'reframing'. The preacher takes the ancient text of the crucifixion and frames it against the 'stylish' and 'sophisticated' sins of modern society (class, race, section). The integration is organic; the preacher doesn't just apply the text to the context but allows the text to 'expose' the context. The 'ignorant actor' and the 'spirituals' provide two different contemporary frames through which the cross is viewed, creating a synthesis that makes the 'then' of Calvary feel like the 'now' of the listener's life.",
      "quotes": [
        "A man all for himself we do not call a sinner. He is 'go-getter'...",
        "Sin, self-centeredness of class, section, race can destroy our land",
        "Jesus at Calvary made sin... expose itself for what it really is."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of sin into modern social and psychological categories.",
        "The use of the spiritual 'Were you there' collapses the distance between the biblical event and the present moment.",
        "The sermon addresses systemic issues (race, class) without losing the personal, existential focus."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'actor' anecdote feels slightly dated and could be replaced with a more universal contemporary 'frame'.",
        "The 'monument in Europe' illustration is the weakest point of integration.",
        "More explicit connection between the 'legions of angels' and modern concepts of power could strengthen the reframing."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "The sermon offers a powerful new frame: the cross is not a religious relic but a diagnostic mirror for modern society."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is theologically certain, it maintains a degree of 'openness' by acknowledging the 'mystery' and the 'strangeness' of the event. The preacher explicitly states, 'I cannot explain it all,' which invites the hearer into the 'space of the between'. However, the structure is somewhat 'sealed' by its traditional theological conclusions. It functions as an 'open work of art' primarily through the use of the spiritual and the invitation to 'look', which requires the listener's active participation. The ending is a mix of closed theological metaphors and an open invitation to 'muse' and 'bow the head'.",
      "quotes": [
        "I cannot explain it all.",
        "Still another look at Calvary...",
        "musing upon it, bowing the head and opening the heart"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The admission of mystery ('I cannot explain it all') creates space for the listener.",
        "The 'look' metaphor encourages active perception rather than passive reception.",
        "The use of the spiritual leaves an emotional 'open end' that lingers."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The final metaphors ('account settled', 'cell door swings') are quite traditional and 'close' the meaning somewhat.",
        "The sermon could benefit from more 'unresolved' questions to increase polyvalence.",
        "The moral categories of 'drunkard' and 'self-centered women' are somewhat monovalent and dated."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "A largely open work that invites 'musing', though it uses some 'closed' dogmatic metaphors in the finale."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is characterized by a series of 'reframing' movements. The preacher successfully moves the listener through different 'looks' at the cross, shifting from the social masks of sin to the 'triumphant assurance' of Christ's character. The narrative arc is effective, starting with an existential question and ending in a space of 'musing' and deliverance. While the 'three-point' nature is visible, the preacher's ability to integrate contemporary social critique with the biblical narrative prevents the structure from feeling static or bureaucratic."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'cheap grace' and 'happy endings' that do not take the 'quivering agony' of the cross or the 'hideous' nature of sin seriously. By describing sin as 'stylish' and 'well-groomed', the preacher deconstructs the kitsch-like masks we use to hide our rebellion. The emotion evoked by the spiritual is authentic ('tremble, tremble, tremble') rather than sentimental. The preacher refuses to 'elaborate and rhapsodize', explicitly rejecting 'purple and florid oratory' which is often the hallmark of homiletical kitsch.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'monument in Europe' story feels slightly like a 'pre-chewed' inspirational illustration.",
      "The 'happy ending' metaphors in the final paragraph ('cell door swings wide') border on the conventional."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The visceral description of sin as 'lying, screaming, plotting the death'.",
      "The admission of 'cheap compromising with principle which you and I practice'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain the 'terse leanness' and continue to avoid the 'purple oratory' that the preacher correctly identifies as a distraction from the truth."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon creates significant 'space for grace' by first creating a 'space for truth' about sin. By refusing to wink at wrong, the preacher makes the 'triumphant assurance' of the cross feel earned rather than forced. The 'space' is opened through the mystery of Christ's non-vengeance. The tension between Christ's power ('twelve legions of angels') and his choice to 'not save himself' is sustained, creating a profound aesthetic of grace that is 'unavailable' and 'surprising'.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between Christ's potential power and his actual suffering is the core of the sermon's aesthetic power.",
    "mystery_respected": "The preacher explicitly honors the 'ugly, stubborn mystery of sin' and the 'mystery of triumphant assurance'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails, though it is a 'costly grace' that follows a sharp diagnosis of human failure.",
    "recommendation": "Deepen the 'space' by allowing the silence of the 'lightless hill' to speak more before moving to the metaphors of deliverance."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.6,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'reframing' and 'stewardship of language'. It avoids the common pitfalls of Passion preaching—sentimentality and florid excess—by adopting a 'terse leanness' that mirrors the Gospel accounts themselves. The preacher effectively uses the African American spiritual tradition to provide an emotional and rhythmic backbone that feels authentic rather than manipulative. The primary aesthetic strength lies in the diagnostic precision with which the preacher strips away the 'stylish' masks of modern sin to reveal the 'hideous' reality that the cross exposes. This creates a genuine 'space for grace' because the 'trouble' (in Wilson's terms) is taken with absolute seriousness. While the structure follows a traditional 'three looks' pattern, the internal movement is dynamic and narrative, leading the hearer from the 'strange' persistence of Calvary to a personal encounter with the 'Savior who would not save himself'. The sermon successfully balances 'showing' (the spirituals, the social masks) and 'telling' (the theological meaning of the incarnation), resulting in a work that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "The 'reframing' of sin into contemporary social and psychological categories.",
      "The rhythmic and emotional use of the spiritual 'Were you there'.",
      "The rejection of 'purple oratory' in favor of a 'terse leanness' of language."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The 'monument' illustration is weak and lacks the sensory precision of the rest of the sermon.",
      "The 'three looks' structure could be further 'opened' to avoid the feel of a closed theological list.",
      "The final metaphors for deliverance are somewhat clichéd compared to the fresh language used earlier."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Poetic-Diagnostic (Sober-Reformed influence with Narrative-Dramatic elements)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Four Pages).",
    "audience_analysis": "Appeals to hearers who are weary of religious clichés and seek a faith that speaks to social reality and psychological depth.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'open' narrative structure that doesn't rely on numbered 'looks'.",
      "Incorporate more silence or 'empty space' in the text to mirror the 'lightless hill'.",
      "Continue to deconstruct religious jargon with the same precision used for 'sin' in this sermon."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically strong performance that honors the 'aesthetic turn' by making the 'how' of the message (the terse, rhythmic, reframing language) inseparable from the 'what' (the mystery of the cross). It avoids kitsch and creates a profound space for an encounter with the Holy through the lens of both personal and social reality. It serves as a model for how to preach the Passion with 'sober beauty' and contemporary relevance."
