      "analysis": "The sermon begins with a concrete geopolitical event (NATO bombing) to establish a sense of 'real world' relevance. It also touches on the 'rubbernecking syndrome' of human nature. However, it quickly moves into abstract territory. The connection to the hearer's immediate emotional life is somewhat distant, relying more on historical or global examples than personal, relatable 'slices of life' that facilitate deep empathy.",

There is a clear cultural critique of modern 'sentimental culture' and academic skepticism. It effectively explores the 'why' behind the shame of the cross rather than just the 'what'.",

The sermon is intellectually dense and provides deep comfort to the 'suffering heart,' but it provides little guidance for the 'active hand.' It functions more as a theological defense and a liturgical immersion than a call to practical ethical change.

    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong example of 'Theological Preaching' that prioritizes the Normative and Interpretive tasks of Osmer. It provides a clear, intellectually satisfying 'Big Idea' and uses evocative imagery to sustain interest. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon—rich in thought and reflection but lean on application. While appropriate for a Good Friday meditation where the goal is often 'contemplation' rather than 'action,' the sermon would be strengthened by completing the learning cycle with more concrete handles for the hearer. It is an effective 'Advocate' for the truth of the cross but a less effective 'Guide' for the practice of the cross."
