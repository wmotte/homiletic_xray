  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "While homiletically powerful and rhetorically skilled, the sermon is psychologically coercive. It relies heavily on the Critical Parent to induce guilt and shame. By comparing non-believers to dogs and questioning the sincerity of any 'respect' for Jesus that doesn't manifest as church-loyalty, the preacher creates a 'closed loop' where the listener cannot win. The final move to 'grace' is a 'Bait and Switch' because it follows a heavy dose of performance-based pressure ('Did I do my best?').",

      "Reliance on 'Formula G' games to create conviction.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult invitation for the listener to decide for themselves."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as Adult subjects capable of reflection rather than children needing a scolding. Replace shaming anecdotes (the dog story) with honest Adult observations about the difficulty of faith. Shift from 'Did I do my best?' (AC) to 'How shall we live in response to this?' (Adult)."
