    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically heavy, utilizing fear-based motivation and Critical Parent dynamics. While theologically orthodox in its tradition, it relies on 'Games' like NIGYSOB to maintain authority. It creates a high-pressure environment for the 'Adapted Child' but offers little space for 'Adult' reflection or 'Free Child' spontaneity.",

      "Clear, consistent internal logic within its theological framework."

      "High level of shaming and coercive language ('must', 'should').",
      "Over-reliance on the 'Deathbed' trope to induce compliance.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult transaction; the listener is treated as spiritually incompetent."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the congregation as 'Adults' who are capable of making choices based on values rather than fear. Reduce the use of 'NIGYSOB' anecdotes (like the sleeping youth) which serve to shame rather than enlighten. Move from 'I tell you that you are blind' to 'Let us examine our vision together'."
