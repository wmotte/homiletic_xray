    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The 'Sache' (factual content) is secondary to the commemorative purpose. The preacher provides biographical data (Tidewater origins, parents, academic/pulpit career) and a brief exegetical nod to the church at Smyrna. However, the theological 'Sache'—the living Christ—is often obscured by the monumentalization of the deceased. The exegesis of Revelation 2:10 is used more as a biographical template than a theological exploration of the resurrected Christ's address. The distinction between 'until' and 'unto' death provides a rare moment of linguistic precision, but overall, the 'blue' side serves the 'green' and 'yellow' sides rather than standing as an independent witness to the Word.",
      "quotes": [
        "He was born in the Tidewater...",
        "The Spirit spoke to me of what Jesus spoke to the church at Smyrna...",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as a peer of the deceased, yet one who feels 'rough gingham' in the presence of 'rich brocade.' There is a conscious 'Selbstdarstellung' of humility ('I was not competent'). The green side 'leaks' a deep sense of shared history and perhaps a subtle awareness of his own mortality ('mine is not yet'). The authenticity is high, but it borders on the 'Hysterical' type in the Riemann sense—not as a pejorative, but as a preacher who uses the stage for high emotional resonance and personal expression. The 'I' is prominent, yet it serves to validate the weight of the loss for the congregation.",
      "quotes": [
        "I knew then, as I know now, that I was not competent to do this.",
        "I will carry to my dying day the memory of Sam Proctor that evening...",
        "Mine is not yet, it seems..."

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Hysterical/Depressive. The preacher seeks emotional connection (Depressive) and utilizes grand, poetic imagery to command the space (Hysterical).",

    },
    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is one of 'Solidary Authority.' The preacher speaks as a representative of 'Christendom' and the 'republic,' placing himself both among the mourners and as their liturgical leader. There is a paternalistic warmth toward the family. The 'yellow' signals are highly respectful, almost courtly. However, there is a 'Relationship Noise' risk: the extreme elevation of Proctor ('there were no superiors') might make the average hearer ('the least of us') feel spiritually inadequate, despite the preacher's verbal assurances to the contrary.",
      "quotes": [
        "On behalf of Christendom and on behalf of a grateful republic, I want today to thank you...",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily 'Anspruch' (demand) disguised as 'Zuspruch' (promise). The core message is 'Be thou faithful.' While framed as a reward for Proctor, it functions as a moral imperative for the living. The ratio is skewed toward the 'Law' of faithfulness. The 'Zuspruch' is tied strictly to performance ('I will measure your service'). This creates a high risk of moralism: the hearer is told that faithfulness is 'within the grasp,' yet the example provided (Proctor) is so superhumanly 'driven' that the appeal may feel crushing rather than liberating.",
      "quotes": [
        "Be thou faithful unto death...",
        "Faithfulness is within the grasp of the least of us...",
        "I will measure your service. I will take account of what you have been."

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The promise (Crown of Life) is strictly conditional upon the demand (Faithfulness), leaning heavily toward Law.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "High. The sermon suggests that God's reward is a meritocratic 'accounting' of one's 'odyssey'.",
      "strengths": [
        "Clear, directional force.",
        "Inspiring call to social and racial 'inoculation'."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This is a masterclass in commemorative rhetoric, but it faces significant homiletical challenges from a Schulz von Thun and Barthian perspective. The 'Green' side is powerful; the preacher’s authenticity and grief are palpable. However, the 'Blue' side (theological substance) is subsumed by the 'Yellow' side (the relationship between the preacher, the deceased, and the 'republic'). Theologically, the sermon risks 'psychologizing' the resurrection into a mere 'arrival gate' reunion. The 'Red' side (appeal) is heavily meritocratic, focusing on Proctor’s 'service' and 'armor' as the basis for his reward, which may leave the 'Appeal Ear' feeling a sense of 'ready-to-jump' servility rather than the 'rest' of the Gospel. It is a 'Satisfactory' to 'Ample Satisfactory' sermon because it fulfills the funeral function with dignity, but it lacks the 'Healing Disruption' that would point away from the 'Mighty Oak' toward the 'Root of Jesse'.",
    "barthian_warning": "Significant psychologization. The deceased becomes the 'Acting Subject' of the sermon, while God is relegated to the 'Accountant' who rewards human faithfulness.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Exceptional use of metaphor and poetic cadence.",
      "Strong emotional resonance and authenticity.",
      "Effective cultural contextualization (Tidewater, racism inoculation)."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Shift focus from the faithfulness of the man to the faithfulness of God.",
      "De-escalate the meritocratic 'accounting' of the reward.",
      "Address the congregation's need for grace, not just the deceased's 'crown'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A rhetorically brilliant eulogy that struggles to remain a 'sermon' in the strict sense of proclaiming the Gospel as 'Gift' rather than 'Achievement'."
