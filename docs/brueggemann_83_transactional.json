    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and promotes high levels of autonomy. By intentionally deconstructing the 'Critical Parent' version of Lent (guilt/compliance), the preacher creates space for the 'Adult' to observe reality and the 'Free Child' to experience hope. The use of the 'Trust but Verify' framework moves the congregation from passive recipients of dogma to active investigators of grace in their own community.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The Reagan analogy might alienate those with a 'Critical Parent' reaction to that specific political figure.",
      "The list of verifications is quite long; a deeper dive into one might ground the 'Adult' processing even further."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to name and set aside the 'Critical Parent' expectations of the audience at the start of the sermon to ensure the 'Adult' is listening."
