    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The imagery is largely functional rather than evocative. While the text mentions the 'stench' of war or 'wooden toys', these are secondary to the abstract theological debate between Paul and James. The preacher relies on 'dead metaphors' or well-worn biblical tropes (vine and branches, the loom) without revitalizing them for the hearer's imagination. The 'glory' discussed remains a conceptual category rather than a sensory reality. There is a missed opportunity to 'paint' the Sermon on the Mount; instead, the text talks *about* the sermon's difficulty. The most vivid image—the Bruderhof community—is treated more as a sociological example than a poetic vision.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Sermon on the Mount is his tapestry of power woven together with love.",

        "Show the 'hunger and thirst' through physical descriptions of longing rather than just quoting the verse."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Predominantly 'telling'. The text explains the theological mechanics of the Sermon on the Mount rather than showing its impact through narrative or sensory detail."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise and academically rigorous. The preacher demonstrates high 'stewardship of language' by carefully distinguishing between 'prescriptive' and 'descriptive' modes of reading. There is a clear effort to avoid sloppy generalizations about grace. However, the precision is often academic ('logizomai', 'sola fidei'), which may create a barrier for a general congregation. The word choice is deliberate and nuanced, particularly when navigating the tension between James and Paul. It avoids 'Canaanite jargon' in favor of clear, albeit scholarly, theological definitions.",
      "quotes": [
        "The sermon can be read as prescriptive instead of descriptive.",
        "The symbiotic relationship of righteousness and mercy lies at the heart of the Beatitudes.",
        "There is something here of logizomai, that key word in the preaching of Saint Paul."

        "Soften the 'lecture' tone to better suit a liturgical 'proclamation'."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Significant use of theological and Latin jargon (sola gratia, logizomai). While explained, it maintains an academic distance."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The rhythm is that of a well-written essay rather than an oral performance. Sentences are often long and complex, containing multiple clauses that require visual reading to fully grasp. There is a lack of rhetorical 'breathing space'—staccato sentences or parallelisms that aid oral retention are rare. The cadence is steady and informative but lacks the 'crescendo' or 'diminuendo' associated with moving preaching. It sounds like 'paper language'—logical and structured, but lacking the melodic quality that characterizes the 'aesthetic turn'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Almost from its beginnings in the power of the resurrection of the crucified Lord, the church has recognized the Sermon on the Mount as the radical center of Jesus’ teaching.",
        "It is the sine qua non of Christian discipleship, a summons to be an embodied enactment of the Way of God.",
        "The way of life Jesus describes in the sermon is therefore that of his own body, the church."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The opening question creates a natural hook.",
        "The concluding sentence uses a rhythmic quote from a hymn to provide a sense of resolution.",
        "Logical transitions ('Therefore', 'It may be doubted, however') provide a clear, if academic, flow."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Vary sentence length more intentionally; use shorter sentences for emphasis.",
        "Incorporate more rhetorical repetition (anaphora) to emphasize the 'Way of Glory'.",
        "Read the text aloud to identify 'clunky' academic phrases that hinder oral delivery."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Strongly 'paper language'. The structure and vocabulary are designed for the eye and the intellect, not the ear and the heart."
    },
    "average_score_language": 5.67,
    "summary_language": "The language is intellectually robust and theologically precise, scoring well on 'stewardship of words' but falling short in sensory imagery and oral musicality. It functions more as a theological treatise than a poetic event. The preacher 'tells' the congregation about the beauty of the Sermon on the Mount without 'showing' it through vivid metaphors. While the use of academic terms provides clarity for the student of theology, it lacks the 'sober beauty' and rhythmic cadence required for a truly aesthetic homiletic experience."
  },
  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a logical 'teaching arc' rather than a 'homiletical plot' (Lowry). It begins with a conceptual conflict (Glory vs. Sermon on the Mount), moves through a theological 'knot' (Law vs. Gospel), and concludes with a concrete example (Bruderhof). While there is movement, the 'upsetting of equilibrium' is intellectual rather than existential. The tension is found in the 'interpretation' of the text rather than in the 'life' of the hearer. The turning point—the shift from the 'impossible' law to the 'gift' of the Beatitudes—is clear but feels more like a solved equation than a dramatic rescue.",
      "quotes": [
        "How does the theme of glory... fit with the large amount of space devoted to the Sermon on the Mount?",
        "Are we to understand the Sermon on the Mount as law, or as gospel?",
        "The Bruderhof is proof that the Sermon on the Mount can actually be lived."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The transition from the abstract debate to the concrete example of the Bruderhof provides a necessary 'landing'.",
        "The initial 'reframing' of glory (military vs. Christological) sets a good direction.",
        "The conclusion successfully ties back to the theme of Epiphany."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Introduce the 'problem' (the impossibility of the Sermon) through a human story rather than a theological question.",
        "Create more 'suspense' around the tension between Paul and James before offering the synthesis.",
        "Ensure the conclusion feels like a 'sending out' rather than just a 'summary of a case study'."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A 'didactic journey'. It moves from a question to an answer through logical steps, lacking the 'upset' of a true narrative plot."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels at 'reframing' (Cilliers). It takes the familiar 'glory' of Epiphany and reframes it through the 'humility' of the Sermon on the Mount. The integration of the biblical text with contemporary culture is handled through literary (O'Connor) and sociological (Bruderhof) lenses. It avoids the pitfall of 'smoothing over' the text by acknowledging its 'strange' and 'impossible' nature. The connection between the 1st-century 'Way' and the 21st-century 'Bruderhof' feels organic, though the 'context' of the actual congregation sitting in the pews is somewhat neglected in favor of broader cultural observations.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is the glory of a righteous cause... with the glory that belongs solely to Jesus Christ.",
        "Flannery O’Connor’s short story “Revelation” comes to mind.",
        "Unlike the Amish, they are at home on social media and make good use of it."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong 'reframing' of the concept of glory.",
        "Effective use of the Bruderhof as a 'living interpretation' of the text.",
        "Honors the 'strangeness' of the Sermon on the Mount without domesticating it."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Connect the 'context' more directly to the 'ordinary Christian' mentioned in the text—what does this look like in a 9-to-5 job?",
        "Deepen the 'reframing' by showing how the Sermon on the Mount disrupts specific modern 'pretensions'.",
        "Make the transition from the O'Connor story back to the text more seamless."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes. It successfully reframes 'glory' from power/success to 'perfected humanity' in sacrifice."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon leans toward 'closedness'. It functions as an 'expert witness' providing the 'correct' interpretation of the Law/Gospel tension. While it mentions that 'no individual has ever captured its definitive meaning', the sermon itself provides a very definitive, neatly synthesized Lutheran/Reformed answer. There is little room for the hearer's own struggle or ambivalence; the 'solution' (it's a gift, not a task) is presented as a fait accompli. The use of the Bruderhof, while inspiring, can feel prescriptive—'see, it can be done'—potentially closing the space for those who feel they cannot live such a life.",
      "quotes": [
        "Therefore the preaching should never sound prescriptive.",
        "The sermon is not a manifesto for the way that the world at large is supposed to work.",
        "It will therefore always be open to multiple misinterpretations by those who do not understand the giver."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The quote from Lischer about the 'pilgrim church' acknowledges the ongoing nature of interpretation.",
        "The ending invitation to 'hunger and thirst' leaves a small window for the hearer's desire.",
        "Explicitly warns against 'smug self-righteousness'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Leave some of the 'tensions' between James and Paul unresolved to allow the hearer to 'sit' in the mystery.",
        "Ask more rhetorical questions that invite the hearer to find their own place in the 'parade of saints'.",
        "Avoid 'answering' every theological difficulty; allow the 'strangeness' of Jesus to remain strange."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly monovalent. It seeks to establish a 'correct' theological framework rather than opening a space for polyvalent experience."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is logically sound and intellectually satisfying, moving from a conceptual problem to a concrete 'proof of concept'. It succeeds in 'reframing' the season's theme but does so through a didactic rather than a dramaturgical arc. The integration of text and context is a major strength, particularly through the use of the Bruderhof. However, the sermon feels 'sealed' by its own theological correctness, leaving little room for the hearer to navigate the 'ambivalence of existence' or the 'resistance' Stark describes."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It explicitly attacks 'facile demonization' and 'smug self-righteousness'. It refuses the 'happy ending' of immediate moral success, instead emphasizing the 'struggle' and the 'present evil age'. By acknowledging that the Sermon on the Mount is 'humanly impossible', it avoids the kitsch of 'easy discipleship'. The emotions evoked are sober and grounded in 'authentic' theological tension rather than 'sentimental' manipulation. The choice of the Bruderhof—a community that 'has its struggles'—further anchors the sermon in reality.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The potential kitsch of the 'Battle Hymn of the Republic' is identified and critiqued early on.",
      "The 'fake it till you make it' mentality is dismissed as cynical."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The admission that the sermon is 'strange teaching' and 'humanly impossible'.",
      "The description of the Bruderhof as 'not perfect' and having 'their struggles'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this sobriety but allow for more 'vulnerability' in the language to move from 'intellectual authenticity' to 'existential authenticity'."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon makes a concerted effort to 'open space for grace' by insisting that the Sermon on the Mount is a 'gift' and a 'result' of justification, not a 'cause'. It fights against the 'closing' effect of moralism. However, the 'space' is somewhat intellectualized. While it theoretically opens space for grace, the dense theological argumentation might 'close' the space for a hearer who is not academically inclined. The 'mystery' of the Godhead at the loom is mentioned but quickly explained through the lens of the 'New Adam' theology.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'already' and 'not yet' is sustained, particularly in the discussion of the Beatitudes.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery is acknowledged but often immediately categorized into systematic theological boxes (Justification/Sanctification).",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. The preacher explicitly warns against prescriptive moralization.",
    "recommendation": "Use more 'open endings' and 'silence' in the text to allow the 'Space for Grace' to be felt rather than just explained."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.2,
    "summary": "This sermon (or homiletic essay) is a work of high intellectual and theological integrity, but it sits on the threshold of the 'aesthetic turn'. Its strength lies in its 'stewardship of language' and its ability to 'reframe' complex theological concepts for a modern context. It avoids the 'kitsch' of easy answers and moralism, consistently pointing to the 'Space for Grace' found in Christ as the 'New Adam'. However, from an aesthetic perspective, it remains too 'academic-declarative'. It speaks *about* the beauty of the Way of Glory without fully *embodying* that beauty in its own form. The imagery is sparse, and the rhythm is more suited to the study than the sanctuary. It functions as an 'Open Work of Art' in theory (by quoting Lischer and O'Connor) but remains a 'Closed System of Truth' in its rhetorical execution. It is a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that values truth over sensory impact, which is a valid tradition, but it misses the 'cinematic' and 'performative' potential that modern homiletics advocates for.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Intellectual precision and 'stewardship of language' regarding Law and Gospel.",
      "Effective 'reframing' of the theme of Glory through the lens of the Sermon on the Mount.",
      "Strong anti-kitsch stance that honors the difficulty of the Christian life."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Transition from 'telling' theological facts to 'showing' through sensory imagery.",
      "Break the 'paper language' structure to create a more oral, rhythmic cadence.",
      "Increase 'openness' by allowing more room for the hearer's own interpretation and struggle."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Academic-Declarative / Sober-Reformed",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Thomas G. Long (Preacher as Witness to the text) and Gerrit Immink (focus on the 'divine actor'), but lacks the 'imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'intellectual seekers' and 'theologically literate' congregants who value clarity, logic, and doctrinal depth over emotional experience.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Start with a concrete, sensory image of 'hunger' or 'thirst' to ground the Beatitudes.",
      "Reduce the number of theological 'labels' and let the narrative of the Bruderhof speak for itself.",
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the congregation with a question rather than a summary."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a solid '6.2'. It is a 'good' sermon that meets the requirements of theological depth and contextual relevance. It excels in its 'anti-kitsch' sobriety and its 'reframing' of glory. However, it does not yet 'excel' aesthetically because the form remains subservient to the information. To move toward a '7' or '8', the preacher must allow the 'Poetics of Language' to catch up to the 'Precision of Doctrine', transforming the sermon from a lecture on glory into a glorious event in itself."
