    "sermon_start_end": "In 1 Corinthians 6:18, the blessed Apostle Paul writes: “All other sins a person commits are outside his body; but when he commits fornication, he sins in his own body.” [...] as soon as he’s free from the vice of fornication in the broad sense, his sins will be outside the body, for (as I’ve said several times) he himself will somehow be outside the body—a stranger to it.",
    "notes": "This is a modernized translation of a classic Augustinian sermon. It follows a highly dialectical and exegetical structure."

    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is notably weak in providing contemporary concrete experiences. It lacks a 'hook' that connects with the modern hearer's daily life or specific recognizable situations. The experience is primarily intellectual or focused on the internal psychological state of the sinner in a general sense, rather than specific 'slices of life'. The 'feeling' level is addressed through the description of passion, but it remains descriptive rather than evocative of a shared experience.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "This is a strong phase in the sermon. Augustine spends significant time pausing at the 'why' and 'how' of the human condition. He explores the problem of why Paul distinguishes between sins in and outside the body, using this as a springboard to analyze the nature of human obsession and the loss of mental freedom during sin.",
      "quotes": [
        "Can the question these words raise be answered perfectly? It’s so profound that I don’t know.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is most effective here. It provides a deep theological exposition of the Pauline text. Augustine moves from the specific sin of fornication to a 'broad sense' theological framework where fornication is defined as any attachment to the world over God. The logical connections between different scriptures (James, John, Psalms) are used to build a robust dogmatic definition.",

      "analysis": "This phase is almost entirely absent in terms of concrete action. While there is a call to 'shun sexual immorality' and 'use your body for the glory of God', these remain high-level imperatives. There are no specific steps, ethical 'how-tos', or practical guidance on how a hearer might begin to detach from the 'world' or 'mammon' in their daily routine.",

It succeeds in providing a profound theological framework for understanding the unique nature of sexual sin and its broader implications as 'attachment to the world.' However, it falls short of a complete learning cycle. The lack of Concrete Experience makes the entry point difficult for a modern hearer, and the absence of Active Experimentation leaves the hearer without a clear path forward. It is a 'Declarative' sermon that functions well as an intellectual defense of a doctrine but lacks the 'Pragmatic' and 'Narrative' elements necessary for holistic adult learning. The language is strong and evocative, yet the structure remains largely theoretical.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a strong example of classical, declarative preaching that focuses on the 'Normative' and 'Interpretive' tasks of theology. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'half-cycle' sermon: it excels at moving the hearer from a question to a deep theological insight, but it fails to move the hearer from that insight back into the world of action. It is intellectually stimulating but practically thin. To reach a broader range of learners and facilitate true transformation, the preacher must bridge the gap between the 'temple of the soul' and the 'streets of the city' through concrete application and narrative engagement."
