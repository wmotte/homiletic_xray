    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and health-promoting. It avoids the common homiletical trap of using the 'Critical Parent' to shame the 'Adapted Child' into obedience. Instead, it uses 'Adult' data (linguistics and social observation) to empower the 'Free Child' and 'Adult' in the listener. It successfully moves from a recognition of shared anxiety (Victim role in the Drama Triangle) to a state of spiritual and social agency (Autonomy).",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using the 'we' pronoun to maintain solidarity and ensure that the 'Adult' ego state remains the primary vehicle for interpreting the 'Free Child's' spiritual experiences."
