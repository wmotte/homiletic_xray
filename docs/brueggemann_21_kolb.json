I therefore had to include both the president and the governor (or alternatively, the president and the president-elect), knowing of course that we would indeed be “after” one of them. [...] Our insistence is that the city has been misunderstood because the Holy actor at its core has been unnoticed. And where God’s “therefore” is unnoticed, God’s “afterward” will not be received. But that future is indeed sure . . . and it is coming.",

It effectively uses the biblical text of Isaiah to frame the 'urban crisis' as a theological rather than merely political issue. However, it falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase of Kolb's cycle. While it provides a compelling 'Afterward' to hope for, it offers little in the way of a 'How-to' for the present. The language is sophisticated and poetic, which serves the Diverging and Assimilating learning styles well but may leave the Converging learner (who seeks practical utility) without clear direction. The 'Therefore/Afterward' structure is a brilliant conceptual tool, but the sermon would be more balanced if it translated the 'resolve' of the conclusion into specific, communal practices.",

    "conclusion": "This is a high-quality sermon that functions as a theological 'map' for understanding the city. It is effective in its prophetic task of 'dismantling' the current reality and 'energizing' the hope for a new one. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'top-heavy' sermon—strong on reflection and conceptualization but light on application. It succeeds in changing how the hearer *thinks* and *sees* the city, but it is less certain to change how the hearer *lives* in the city. The priority for improvement is the integration of the Pragmatic quadrant to ensure the 'Afterward' begins to take shape in the 'Now' through the actions of the faith community."
