      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon lacks a specific, contemporary 'slice of life' or a personal hook in the introduction. It begins with abstract assertions about Easter. While it vividly describes the biblical scene of the lame beggar, it relies on the hearer's ability to imagine a historical scene rather than connecting to the hearer's immediate, felt experience. The emotional connection is secondary to the thematic development.",

      "analysis": "The sermon effectively analyzes the 'problem' of the world—despair, chatter, and deathly structures. It pauses to consider the 'why' behind the beggar's condition and the societal reaction (shame, vanity). However, the reflection often shifts quickly into theological assertion rather than allowing the hearer to dwell in the tension of the human condition.",

While the exegesis of Acts 3 and the creative use of Psalm 4 are effective, the sermon remains somewhat detached from the immediate life-world of the listener. It addresses the 'Assimilating' learner with great clarity but may leave the 'Diverging' learner seeking more poetic inspiration. The transition from the cosmic victory of Easter to the specific social applications (minimum wage, etc.) is clear but could benefit from more personal, individual application steps.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong example of a Declarative homiletic that successfully bridges biblical narrative with social ethics. From a Kolb perspective, it is intellectually robust (Abstract Conceptualization) and provides clear categories for the church's mission. However, it is 'top-heavy,' prioritizing theological logic over the experiential and reflective phases of the learning cycle. To move from a 6.5 to an 8, the preacher should focus on the 'bottom half' of the Kolb cycle: creating a more visceral, contemporary connection to the human experience and providing more granular, personal applications. It is a well-crafted piece of theological advocacy that would benefit from more 'priestly listening' to the specific, everyday lives of the congregation."
