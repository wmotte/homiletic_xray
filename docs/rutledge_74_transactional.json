    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and remarkably game-free. It utilizes an Adult-Adult transaction to deconstruct the 'spirituality' industry, which often functions as a Parent-Child 'Self-Help' game. By emphasizing that the Holy Spirit is a 'verb' and an external power, the preacher relieves the listener of the burden of 'Adapted Child' performance (trying to be spiritual enough). The preacher's vulnerability regarding her own history and the church's failures prevents the sermon from becoming a Persecutor-led 'Ain't It Awful' session.",
    "strengths": [
      "High transparency and use of Adult ego.",
      "Avoidance of the Drama Triangle by refusing the Rescuer role.",
      "Healthy modeling of the Free Child through vulnerability."

      "The critique of 'spirituality' could be more precisely defined to ensure it isn't heard as a Critical Parent judgment on the listener's personal practices."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements when discussing failure and 'We' statements when discussing the need for the Spirit. This maintains a level playing field and prevents the congregation from slipping into a defensive Adapted Child state."
