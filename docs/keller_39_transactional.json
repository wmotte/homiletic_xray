  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy because it utilizes the Adult ego state to dismantle the listener's internal Critical Parent. By reframing 'Justice' as something for the believer rather than against them, the preacher reduces the 'Adapted Child' response of guilt-driven compliance. The use of personal vulnerability (Free Child) and intellectual rigor (Adult) creates a balanced, non-coercive environment. The only minor risk is the concluding pivot to 'Stop your self-centeredness,' which momentarily shifts into a Critical Parent tone, potentially triggering a brief 'I'm not OK' feeling in the listener.",
    "strengths": [
      "Engages the Adult ego through clear, logical teaching.",
      "Reduces shame by redefining God's justice as a defense attorney.",
      "Promotes autonomy by describing the Spirit as an internal 'Ultimate Friend'."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition to 'obey' could be more Adult-Adult (consequences) rather than Parent-Child (commands).",
      "The 'Better Homes and Gardens' illustration might inadvertently set a 'Critical Parent' standard for what a 'Spirit-filled' home looks like."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to emphasize the 'Adult' processing of the 'Advocate's' case. When calling for obedience, frame it as a logical response to reality (Adult) rather than a cessation of 'self-indulgence' (Critical Parent) to avoid the ITHY game."
