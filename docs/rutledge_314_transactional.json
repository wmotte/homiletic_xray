        "presence_of_coercion": "Low",
        "analysis": "While the preacher uses strong language regarding sin and shame, it is directed at a universal human condition rather than a finger-wagging 'you must'. The CP is present but serves a theological purpose rather than a personal power play.",

    "analysis": "The preacher primarily addresses the congregation as thinking subjects capable of historical reflection and self-examination. The shift to Parent -> Child at the end is Nurturing rather than Critical.",

      "rescuer": "Low. The preacher points to Jesus as the one who prays, rather than claiming to save the congregation themselves.",

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the typical 'guilt-tripping' games associated with Passion Sunday. By using the Adult ego state to deconstruct the 'religious' romanticism of the cross, the preacher prevents the listener from retreating into a defensive Adapted Child state. The move from historical data (Adult) to universal human shadow (Free Child vulnerability) to ultimate grace (Nurturing Parent) creates a healthy movement toward autonomy and integration.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of Adult ego state to ground the discourse.",
      "Avoidance of the Drama Triangle by including the self in the critique.",
      "Deconstruction of 'religious' masks that often facilitate psychological games."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The use of extreme examples (Saddam, Pol Pot) can sometimes trigger a 'Victim' or 'Persecutor' response in the listener before the pivot to the self occurs."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using the 'we' pronoun to maintain the Adult-Adult contract. Ensure the 'Nurturing Parent' conclusion remains an offer of autonomy rather than a demand for dependency."
