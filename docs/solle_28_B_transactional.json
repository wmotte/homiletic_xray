    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically vibrant, successfully activating the 'Free Child' through poetic language and imagery. It avoids the 'NIGYSOB' game common in religious texts by directing judgment outward rather than at the congregation. However, it heavily utilizes the 'Drama Triangle' by casting global economic forces as the Persecutor and the preacher/church as the Rescuer. The psychological impact is one of empowerment, though it relies on a 'Common Enemy' (Ain't It Awful) to build cohesion.",

      "Strong activation of the Free Child (creativity/joy).",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Heavy use of 'Ain't It Awful' can lead to collective passivity or rage.",
      "The 'Critical Parent' tone regarding political opponents can be alienating for 'Adult' reflection."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to address the 'Adult' of the listener more when discussing political solutions. Instead of 'Who taught you this nonsense?', ask 'What facts lead you to feel like an isolated individual?' to promote self-analysis."
