    "summary": "This sermon is a classic example of Critical Parent dominance. It utilizes a dualistic framework that pits the soul against the body, effectively shaming the listener's biological and emotional reality. By expanding the definition of 'fornication' to include any 'attachment to the world,' it creates a psychological trap where the listener is perpetually in the 'wrong,' fostering a state of Adapted Child compliance and dependency on the religious authority for 'rescue.'",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as Adult-to-Adult. Instead of 'instilling horror,' invite them to reflect on how their choices impact their relationships and self-worth in the 'here-and-now.' Reduce the use of loaded, shaming adjectives."
