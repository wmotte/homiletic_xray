    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Nurturing Parent' language being used to deliver 'Critical Parent' content. While it speaks of love and grace, it psychologically anchors these concepts in a requirement for the listener to adopt a 'Miserable Offender' (Adapted Child) identity. This creates a dependency loop where the listener must feel 'bad' to feel 'saved,' a hallmark of religious 'Games.'",

      "Clear Adult-level historical and liturgical analysis."

      "Over-reliance on shaming language ('no health in us') as a prerequisite for grace.",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult invitation for the listener to define their own relationship with the Divine."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as capable Adults who can experience God's love without first being labeled as 'miserable.' Shift from 'You must admit you are broken' (P->C) to 'Let's explore how this ancient text reflects our current reality' (A->A)."
