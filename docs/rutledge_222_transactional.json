    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exceptionally healthy example of Adult-to-Adult communication. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the Critical Parent (moralism) and the 'Bait and Switch' game. By identifying himself as a fellow 'bruised reed,' the preacher levels the psychological playing field, moving from a position of shared vulnerability to shared hope. The use of Tennessee Williams provides a 'reality test' (Adult) that grounds the theological abstractions in the 'here-and-now' of human suffering.",

      "High level of self-disclosure prevents the 'Holier than thou' game.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'aha moment' concept could be seen as slightly mystical/exclusive, potentially making those who don't feel it feel like 'Not-OK' outsiders."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' and 'us' language. Maintain the distinction between 'Sin' as a Power (which we are victims of) and 'sins' as choices, as this prevents the listener from retreating into a defensive Adapted Child state."
