    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. While it uses the language of love and grace, it structurally relies on shaming the listener into an Adapted Child position. By insisting on the phrase 'there is no health in us,' the preacher actively undermines the listener's Adult ego state and internal sense of agency. The 'love' described is paternalistic and conditional upon the listener's self-negation.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Address the congregation as Adults capable of moral choice and inherent worth. Instead of demanding a 'miserable' status to receive grace, present grace as a catalyst for Adult responsibility and Free Child spontaneity. Reduce the use of 'must' and 'total inability' language."
