    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively facilitates concrete experience through high-stakes emotional imagery. By utilizing the 'desperate parent' metaphor, the preacher bypasses intellectual distance and grounds the theological concept of the Trinity in universal human affect. The hearer is not asked to define God, but to feel the desperation of love. This phase is strong because it connects the 'full Trinitarian blessing' to the 'crabbed, tumultuous' reality of broken relationships.",

        "The transition from the parent metaphor to the Trinitarian formula is rapid; more space could be given to the 'feeling' of the Corinthian church's rejection.",

    },
    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Reflection is facilitated through a critical look at the human condition and liturgical shifts. The preacher pauses to ask 'why' the removal of certain phrases in the Prayer Book matters, leading the hearer to reflect on their own resistance to the concept of sin. It explores the 'problem' of the 'miserable offender' without offering a cheap psychological exit, forcing a pause at the 'depths' (De Profundis).",
      "quotes": [
        "The removal of this line has robbed us of a powerful buttress to the biblical concept of sin.",
        "Reflect on your own life. Think about those people who have borne with you.",

    "phase_3_abstract_conceptualization": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Theological depth is present, particularly in the definition of the Trinity as 'dynamic interrelatedness.' The preacher moves from the experience of love to the dogmatic formulation of God's inner being. The exegesis of Psalm 130 provides a 'big idea': that forgiveness is the root of holy fear. However, the exegesis is more thematic than technical, leaning on 'wisdom of the sage' rather than dense linguistic study.",
      "quotes": [
        "The inmost being of God is a dynamic interrelatedness that pours itself out for the other without ceasing.",

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "This is the weakest phase. While the sermon offers 'renewed confidence' and 'honesty leading to deliverance,' it lacks specific, concrete action steps. The application remains largely internal and dispositional. The hearer is invited to 'go forth' with knowledge, but the 'how' of practicing Trinitarian love or 'De Profundis' honesty in a specific Monday-morning context is missing.",

    "overall_kolb_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a strong example of visionary and narrative preaching that grounds high theology (the Trinity) in deep human emotion (parental love). It effectively utilizes Kolb's first three phases, creating a resonant 'Concrete Experience' and moving into a 'Reflective Observation' of both the self and the liturgy. The 'Abstract Conceptualization' is clear and avoids academic dryness. However, the sermon falls short in 'Active Experimentation.' It provides the hearer with a new way to *see* and *feel* God's grace, but offers very little in the way of how to *act* on that grace in a concrete, ethical, or practical sense. It is a 'Heart-Head' sermon that forgets the 'Hands.'",

      "Strengthen the 'Pragmatic' quadrant by asking: 'What is one specific thing a person can do this week to mirror God's non-calculating love?'",
      "Include a 'Converging' element: a case study or a 'how-to' for confession.",
      "Maintain the strong 'Concrete Experience' openings but ensure they lead to a clear 'Active Experimentation' close."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a rhetorically effective and theologically sound piece that succeeds in making the Trinity 'lovable' and sin 'real.' From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'Diverging-Assimilating' success but a 'Converging' failure. It takes the hearer on a journey of the heart and mind but leaves them at the church door without a map for the road. The priority for improvement is the development of the Pragmatic task: converting 'renewed confidence' into 'servant leadership' and concrete action."
