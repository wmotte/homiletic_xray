    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The 'Sache' is the sovereignty and performative nature of the Word of God. The preacher demonstrates high exegetical precision, particularly in the distinction between 'seeing' and 'hearing' in Ezekiel's vision. By referencing the 'appearance of the likeness of the glory,' she maintains the theological distance required by the transcendence of God. The inclusion of Karl Barth’s 'Doctrine of the Word of God' provides a robust dogmatic framework. The content is intellectually stimulating but avoids dry academicism by linking the 'blue' side directly to the 'performative' nature of God's speech—it does not just inform; it creates reality. The explanation of 'Mortal' vs. 'Son of Man' adds necessary clarity without being pedantic.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Word of God is performative — that is to say, it is actively at work making itself happen.",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals herself as an intellectual peer to her congregation, admitting that Freud 'shakes her faith every time.' This is a diaconal use of the 'I'; she is not performing her piety but sharing her struggle to make the gospel credible in a secular environment. There is a sense of professional vulnerability regarding her role as 'clergy' in a city that views religion as an evolutionary relic. However, she remains firmly in control of the narrative, using her personal interactions (the therapist, reading Freud) to serve the homiletical goal rather than for self-centered expression.",
      "quotes": [
        "It shakes my faith every time, and as a result I understand better the resistance to the gospel.",
        "I realize now as never before that the polite silence... is actually a mask.",

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Schizoid blend. The focus on 'correct' reading of the Bible and the reliance on massive dogmatic structures (Barth) suggests a need for order (Compulsive), while the intellectual distance and focus on the 'otherness' of God suggests a Schizoid preference for objective truth over emotional fusion.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'solidary'—the preacher and the congregation are together in the 'trenches' of New York City. She uses 'we' and 'us' frequently, positioning herself as a fellow traveler. However, there is a subtle 'teaching' authority (paternalistic/maternalistic) when she instructs the congregation on how to read the Bible (e.g., 'like a story'). The tone is one of encouragement but also of firm commissioning. She defines the congregation's identity as 'witnesses,' which places a specific expectation on the relationship.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The appeal is masterfully handled through the lens of 'Zuspruch' (Promise). The primary appeal is not 'do better,' but 'receive the Word' and 'stand on your feet.' The preacher avoids moralism by grounding the change of heart (Ezekiel 36) entirely in God's action ('I will do it'). The 'Anspruch' (Demand) is the call to witness, but it is presented as a 'determination of existence' rather than a legalistic burden. The sermon moves from the pressure of secular judgment to the freedom of divine promise.",

        "Mortal, stand upon your feet, and I will speak with you.",

  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.8,
    "summary": "This is a sophisticated, theologically dense sermon that successfully navigates the tension between secular intellectualism and biblical revelation. By utilizing the 'Evolutionary Ladder' as a psychological hook, the preacher addresses the 'Relationship Ear' of a congregation that feels culturally marginalized. The transition to the 'Blue' side (Barthian Dogmatics) is handled with authority, effectively shifting the focus from human 'experience' to God as the 'Acting Subject'. The sermon avoids the trap of psychologization by insisting that God speaks 'first' and 'peremptorily'. The 'Green' side is used diaconally to model how an intellectual person can yield to the 'sweetness' of the Word. While the tone is occasionally paternalistic, it fits the 'Teaching' role required for this specific audience. The 'Red' side is properly subordinated to the 'Zuspruch' of Ezekiel 36, ensuring the sermon remains Gospel-centered rather than Law-centered.",
    "barthian_warning": "Minimal psychologization. The preacher explicitly warns that we cannot 'imagine' God or build knowledge on impressions; revelation is an act of God alone.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Brilliant use of a cultural 'hook' (Evolutionary Ladder) to address relational anxiety.",
      "Rigorous Barthian focus on the 'Performative Word'.",
      "Strong theological distinction between 'seeing' and 'hearing'."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce the 'us vs. them' rhetoric regarding 'secular sophisticates'.",
      "More concrete application of 'witness' in the workplace.",
      "Tighter integration of the 'storytelling' metaphor with the 'dogmatic' claim."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, congruent sermon that serves the 'Sache' of the Gospel with psychological intelligence and theological integrity."
