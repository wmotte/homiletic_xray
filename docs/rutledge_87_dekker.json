    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon uses Daniel 5 as a narrative anchor but treats it more as a representative example of the 'apocalyptic thread' than as a unique word. It fails to identify what is in this specific passage that can be found nowhere else, instead merging it with general apocalyptic themes found in Mark 13 or Revelation.",
      "quotes": [
        "In 164 B.C. ... an unknown Hasidic author ... produced for the encouragement of his people the document known to subsequent generations as the book of Daniel.",
        "The author of the story sets up a parallel which his Hasidic audience would recognize immediately."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Isolate the specific theological weight of the 'writing on the wall' in its Babylonian context versus other apocalyptic visions to find the 'unique' word Dekker demands."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates strong knowledge of the historical-critical context, specifically the Maccabean revolt and Antiochus Epiphanes. The linguistic note on 'apocalypsis' is adequate. However, the exegesis is used more to explain the 'genre' than to dig into the Hebrew nuances of the text itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "The world of that time was like our own in certain interesting respects. The conquests of Alexander the Great had paved the way for the spread of Greek culture...",
        "this is the 'abomination of desolation' referred to in Daniel 11: and Mark 13:14"

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the 'zeitgeist' (Hellenism vs. modern assimilation), but it occasionally slips into generalities about 'marginalized people'. The connection to the Catholic Worker movement provides a specific social location, which Dekker would value.",
      "quotes": [
        "Just as today we travel the world around and see people wearing jeans, listening to rock music, and drinking Coca-Cola...",
        "The similarity to today’s American church is obvious; one may attend worship services in prosperous suburbs for years on end and never perceive any tension..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid the list of 'Nero or a Hitler or an Idi Amin' which becomes a general category of 'bad guys'; keep the application focused on the specific 'Belshazzar' moments in the hearers' immediate context."

    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a largely linear path: historical lecture on apocalypticism, then the story of Daniel 5, then modern application. The 'mixing' Dekker calls for is absent; the hearer is a student of history first and a participant in the text only much later.",
      "quotes": [
        "The apocalyptic thread of which I am speaking began to work its way... namely, about 160 years before the birth of Christ.",
        "Let’s pause a moment to let this sink in. Can you imagine the effect of this story when it was first told..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Integrate the modern 'handwriting on the wall' directly into the narrative of Belshazzar's feast rather than separating them by historical commentary."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Misery is well-defined as 'cultural assimilation' and 'apostasy'. Redemption is found in God's sovereignty. Gratitude is framed as 'witness' and 'faithfulness'. It leans heavily on the 'misery' of the political situation, which is permissible under Dekker's rule.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is in this world threatened with annihilation of various sorts that the recovery of apocalyptic is taking place.",
        "God’s invading grace that enables us to see in the dark, to become children of light."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is a strong point. The preacher emphasizes the 'costly and dangerous' choice between assimilation and faithfulness. The possibility of being 'lost' (temporal loss) is clearly articulated through the lens of the disappeared priests and the 'absorbed church'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Under the fearsome threats of Antiochus’s persecution, every Jew in the area of Jerusalem had to decide whether to deny his heritage and be Hellenized, or be killed.",

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is the 'telos' at the very end, but for the majority of the sermon, He is 'silenced' in favor of a general 'God of Israel' or 'Most High'. The doctrine of the two natures is not utilized to ground the authority of the Son of Man.",
      "quotes": [
        "It was this apocalyptic literature that made way for the time when Daniel’s vision would come true, and the disciples of Jesus of Nazareth... would read the book of Daniel...",
        "May we bear our witness to the Son of Man..."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "At approximately 22 minutes, the sermon meets Dekker's requirement for breadth to achieve depth. It takes the time to build a historical and theological framework.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "The length is adequate; the focus should remain on ensuring the 'breadth' serves the 'specific text' rather than general history."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon functions more as a theological lecture on the genre of apocalyptic than as a proclamatory word emerging from a specific text. It falls short of Dekker's '1.3' requirement by treating Daniel 5 as a vehicle for a 'brilliant new thread' (a biblical idea) rather than a unique revelation. While the historical exegesis is strong and the application to the 'zeitgeist' is concrete, the interwoveness of text and hearer is weak.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong historical-critical grounding regarding the Maccabean context.",
      "Clear articulation of the 'two ways' through the lens of cultural assimilation versus faithfulness.",
      "Adequate length allowing for theological development."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of interwoveness; exposition and application are largely sequential.",
      "The sermon is about 'Apocalypticism' as a concept rather than the specific, non-repeatable word of Daniel 5.",
      "Christ is a late addition (telos) rather than the active subject of the proclamation."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a strong speech about the Bible and its relevance, but according to Dekker's strict criteria, it struggles to be a 'sermon' because it prioritizes a 'biblical idea' (apocalypticism) over the 'specific Bible passage'. It is a bicycle with a well-made wheel that is not yet fully mounted to the frame of the specific text."
