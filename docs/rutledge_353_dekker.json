In two thousand years of Christian art, there have been many great paintings, mosaics, and frescoes of the event [...] those whose only claim to him is that of trust in his indestructible love and his transcendent power to bring us out of Death into life."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon takes Luke 24:5 as a thematic hook but quickly pivots to a general discourse on death and modern culture. It fails to identify what is unique to this specific Lukan passage compared to other resurrection accounts. It treats the text as a 'biblical keyword' for a speech about mortality rather than recreating the specific Word of God in this pericope.",
      "quotes": [
        "The angel's rebuke reverberates across the centuries. To this day we continue to seek for new life in all the wrong places"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify what Luke 24:5 says that cannot be found in Matthew, Mark, or John. Focus on the specific Lukan 'perplexity' of the women rather than using the verse as a springboard for cultural commentary."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is almost no formal exposition of the original context. The preacher does not engage with the Greek text, the historical setting of the women in first-century Judea, or the theological structure of Luke's Gospel. The 'exposition' is replaced by anecdotes and literary references.",
      "quotes": [
        "St. Luke gives us a clue about this mystery in the declaration of the angel at the door of the tomb"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the 'what did it mean then' aspect. Explain the significance of the 'living' (ton zonta) in the context of Lukan theology and the history of Israel's hope."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "This is the sermon's strongest point. The preacher demonstrates a broad knowledge of the humanities (Evelyn Waugh, Jessica Mitford, psychology) and the zeitgeist. The application is concrete, touching on cosmetic surgery, prison systems, and assisted suicide.",
      "quotes": [
        "cosmetic surgery in America has become a growth industry",
        "The NRA continues to hold America hostage to its worst instincts.",
        "I'm telling my children that when I am an old lady they had better not come at me with any plastic bag."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application flows from the text's specific logic rather than being a collection of 'favorite clippings' from a file on death."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward application (cultural analysis). Because the exposition is thin, the 'interwoveness' is lopsided. The hearer is drawn into the preacher's 'big fat file on death' more than into the biblical text itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "In my big fat file on death, I have numerous clippings about Elizabeth Kibler-Ross."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Use the text to 'expound' the hearer. The cultural observations should serve to illuminate the specific biblical word, not replace it."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The category of 'misery' is well-developed through the lens of mortality and the 'death industry.' Redemption is present as an external act of God. Gratitude is less explicit but implied in the closing trust.",
      "quotes": [
        "Death is ugly, bald, miserable....",
        "Faith in the Resurrection comes to us as a pure gift."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' from mere mortality to 'misery before God' (sin/alienation), as Dekker suggests, to avoid purely psychological categories."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon addresses the 'two ways' by contrasting the 'movement in the direction of death' (the broad way of culture) with the 'narrow way' of faith. It takes the hearer's destination seriously, especially regarding assisted suicide.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are looking for life, but we are investing in death.",
        "whereas death by fatal dosage... is not the way of the believer"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the 'eternal loss' aspect more explicit to complement the 'temporal loss' of a society obsessed with control."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as the one who overcomes death, but the sermon often feels like a lecture on the 'philosophy of death' where Christ is the final chapter rather than the telos throughout. The doctrine of the two natures is not clearly operative.",
      "quotes": [
        "What they saw was the risen Lord Jesus himself; and then they knew."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Center the sermon on Christ as God (the two natures) from the beginning, showing how His specific victory is the only ground for the application."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 18 minutes, the sermon falls just short of Dekker's 20-minute minimum. While it has 'breadth' in cultural references, it lacks the 'depth' of rigorous biblical exegesis.",
      "improvement_point": "Increase the length by deepening the exegetical treatment of the Greek text and the theological history of the resurrection."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's ideal primarily due to a lack of rigorous exegesis and a tendency to treat the Bible passage as a thematic springboard for cultural commentary. It functions more as a theological essay on the 'zeitgeist of death' than as an exposition of a specific Word of God. However, it succeeds in being concrete and avoiding 'general truths' by naming specific societal ills.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application to contemporary issues (NRA, cosmetic surgery, assisted suicide).",
      "Strong psychological awareness that 're-claims' space from secular psychology.",
      "Avoidance of 'saccharine' or 'feel-good' theology regarding death."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of original language engagement and historical-critical exegesis.",
      "The Bible text is used as a keyword rather than a specific, unique revelation.",
      "Duration is slightly under the required threshold for 'depth'."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'speech about the gospel and death' rather than a 'sermon' in Dekker's strict formal sense. It lacks the necessary foundation of specific exposition (Thesis 2) to justify its application."
