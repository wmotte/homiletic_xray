  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon centers on the text but treats it more as a thematic anchor for social justice than as a unique revelation. It fails to identify what is in this passage that can be found NOWHERE else. The focus on 'lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness' is treated as a general biblical concept rather than a specific word for the moment.",
      "quotes": [
        "For instance, this passage from Jeremiah...",
        "In Hebrew and Greek, justice and righteousness are the same word."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the specific prophetic tension in Jeremiah's context—why does God delight in these things specifically here, as opposed to the 'wisdom, might, and riches' of the Judean elite?"
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Exegesis is thin. While the preacher mentions Hebrew/Greek linguistic facts, there is almost no attention to the original context of Jeremiah (the Babylonian threat, the failure of the monarchy). The preacher uses the text to jump immediately to American civil rights history.",
      "quotes": [
        "In Hebrew and Greek, justice and righteousness are the same word. Two words in English, but one word in the biblical languages."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the historical-critical situation of the first readers in Jerusalem to explain why the 'wise, mighty, and rich' were being warned."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Application is the strongest suit. It is highly concrete, referencing specific local history (Richmond, the Byrd machine), current events (Obama's election, John Hope Franklin), and a detailed legal case (Earl Ruffin). It avoids vague generalities.",
      "quotes": [
        "The black man’s name was Julius Earl Ruffin. In 1982, when he was a young man working in maintenance at the Eastern Virginia Medical School...",
        "Who in Richmond is voiceless?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application flows from the text's specific logic rather than using the text as a mirror for existing social convictions."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a 'sandwich' structure: anecdote, text, linguistic lesson, long anecdote, return to text. The hearer is not so much 'drawn into the text' as the text is drawn into the preacher's narrative of social progress.",
      "quotes": [
        "Support for that view comes from an unlikely source: the famous atheist...",
        "As we listen to this story, let’s notice some things."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Allow the biblical text to 'expound' the contemporary situation more aggressively, rather than using contemporary stories to explain the text."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Misery is well-articulated through the Ruffin case (injustice/lies). Redemption is present but leans heavily toward human 'moral heroism' and legal reparations. Gratitude is mentioned via Ruffin's response, but the Trinitarian grounding is secondary to the social outcome.",
      "quotes": [
        "First of all, this story is about injustice and lies.",
        "At the hearing, he began by thanking God."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by showing how the 'wise, mighty, and rich' in the congregation are themselves under judgment, not just 'the system'."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon flirts with the 'two ways' by mentioning judgment and the 'sinful world,' but it ultimately feels safe. The 'lostness' is temporal (social injustice) rather than the ultimate possibility of being lost before God. The choice is presented as 'climbing on board a moving train.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The righteousness of God... is out there ahead of us because God is out there ahead of us.",
        "There’s judgment in this story."

      "improvement_point": "Address the 'glorying' in wisdom/might/riches as a path to destruction (the broad way) more sharply."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "Christ is largely absent as the telos. He is mentioned briefly as 'the Truth' and the source of the Kingdom, but the sermon's goal is social justice and moral witness. The doctrine of the two natures is not operative; Christ is a supporting figure for the 'verb' of justice.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wherever the truth prevails over lies, there is the presence of the One who said, 'I AM the Truth'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make Christ the specific 'telos' by showing how His cross is the ultimate 'exercise of judgment and righteousness' mentioned in Jeremiah."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At approximately 1450 words, the sermon likely clocks in under 15 minutes. According to Dekker, it lacks the 'breadth' required for 'depth.' It feels more like a topical speech with a biblical illustration.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical section and the theological connection between the Old Testament 'Lord' and the New Testament 'Christ' to reach the 20-minute threshold."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s definition by prioritizing social narrative over rigorous biblical exposition. It lacks sufficient length (under 20 minutes) and fails to engage the original Hebrew context of Jeremiah. While the application is admirably concrete and avoids generalities, it borders on a 'speech about refugees/social issues' which Dekker explicitly disqualifies as a sermon. Christ is a peripheral figure rather than the telos.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application: The use of the Earl Ruffin case provides a 'true truth' that is specific and local.",
      "Avoidance of 'soft' theology: The preacher correctly insists that God's love cannot be separated from judgment."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specific exegesis: The sermon does not explain what Jeremiah 9:23-24 says that cannot be found elsewhere.",
      "Insufficient duration: The sermon lacks the breadth required for theological depth.",
      "Low Christological focus: The sermon is more 'Theocentric/Social' than 'Christocentric'."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an effective social-ethical address, but it is not a 'sermon' in the strict Dekkerian sense. It lacks the necessary exegetical depth, the required length, and the essential Christological telos."
