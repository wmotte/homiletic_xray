It is somebody's attic room [...] This is the new fellowship begun by that cross.",

    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a vivid reconstruction of the Upper Room and the transition to Gethsemane/Calvary. The 'Sache' (theological core) is the movement from private devotion to public witness. While the exegetical depth regarding Mark 14:26 is limited—treating the verse more as a springboard than a text to be unpacked—the dogmatic connection to the 'new principle of judgment' is clear. The preacher successfully links the 'fides quae' (the historical event of the cross) with a contemporary political ethic. However, the Barthian 'Living Christ' is somewhat flattened into a 'principle' or 'pattern' rather than an acting Subject, leaning more toward an ethical-liberal interpretation of the Gospel's power.",
      "quotes": [
        "There is a new principle of judgment thrown against the skyline of the centuries at Calvary.",
        "The chronicle is honest in declaring the craven cowardice and base desertion.",
        "This nation with all its wealth and influence will live or die as it meets or fails to meet the purposes of God."

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The language is evocative and the logic of the contrast is easily followed by a lay congregation."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals himself as a 'pulpit-oriented' intellectual who values homiletical tradition (citing Paul Scherer). There is a palpable tension between a love for 'tender emotions' and a felt duty toward 'burning issues.' The preacher does not share personal anecdotes but reveals his 'state of faith' through his aesthetic appreciation of the Gospel's 'winsome aspects' and his subsequent moral urgency. The self-revelation is disciplined; the 'I' only appears to cite an authority or a personal 'pulpit idol,' suggesting a preacher who finds identity in the prophetic tradition rather than personal vulnerability.",
      "quotes": [
        "My old pulpit idol, the late Paul Scherer, once said in my hearing...",
        "This is the gospel as we like to think of it.",

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Depressive. Compulsive in the structured, rhythmic use of language and historical correctness; Depressive in the deep longing for 'mystic fellowship,' 'tender affection,' and 'harmony' which he then must heroically abandon for the 'noisy confrontation'.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' is diaconal; it serves the purpose of establishing the preacher as a credible witness within a specific homiletical lineage.",

    },
    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching' and 'Prophetic.' The preacher speaks from a position of moral authority, using the collective 'we' to include the congregation in both the comfort of the Upper Room and the guilt of 'pride of respectability.' There is a slight paternalistic tone when describing the 'humbler homes' and 'ordinary gathering,' which creates a distance between the 'refined' preacher/hearer and the 'crude' historical reality. The 'Yellow' side is stable but lacks the 'eye-level' solidarity that Gerrit Immink emphasizes; the preacher is the guide, the congregation is the led.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are quite content to let that note fill our worship if it is properly conducted behind appropriate stained-glass windows.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The appeal is directional: move from the 'Upper Room' to the 'Mount of Olives.' The ratio of Zuspruch (Promise) to Anspruch (Demand) is initially balanced, but the sermon culminates in a strong 'Anspruch' regarding human rights and national survival. Theologically, the cross is presented as a 'principle of judgment' (Law) and a 'pattern of humanity' (Example) more than a 'substitutionary gift' (Gospel). The 'Red' side is powerful but risks moralism by making the 'New Fellowship' dependent on our belief in 'healing' and 'deliverance' rather than God's unilateral act.",

        "This nation... will live or die as it meets or fails to meet the purposes of God.",

        "High relevance to social context.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a robust example of the 'prophetic-liberal' tradition. It masterfully uses the Schulz von Thun 'Blue' side to paint a narrative picture that serves as a foundation for a 'Red' appeal. Theologically, it aligns with the 'Bohren' emphasis on the aesthetic of the Spirit, yet it leans heavily toward 'Anspruch' (Demand). The preacher successfully avoids 'non-committal warmth' (Depressive type) by pivoting sharply to the 'noisy confrontation.' However, from a Barthian perspective, there is a risk of 'psychologizing' the cross into a 'principle' or a 'rallying place' for human hearts, potentially obscuring God as the primary Acting Subject. The communication is congruent, the language is elevated, and the challenge is clear, though it lacks the 'exceptional' theological depth required for a higher score.",
    "barthian_warning": "The cross is at risk of becoming a 'principle of judgment' (an object of human ethics) rather than the 'Event of Word and Spirit'.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Vivid narrative contrast.",
      "Homiletical authority and rhythm.",

      "Balance the 'Principle' with the 'Person' of Christ.",
      "Increase 'eye-level' relational signals.",
      "Strengthen the 'Zuspruch' in the final third."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A solid, professional, and challenging sermon that effectively uses psychological contrast to drive a theological and ethical point."
