  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is an exemplary model of psychologically healthy communication. It utilizes the Adult ego state to dismantle the 'Adapted Child' guilt-cycle common in religious settings. By shifting the focus from the listener's performance to God's action, the preacher removes the 'Gimmick' (guilt/fear) required for psychological games. The use of the Rosa Parks and the Virginia mother stories provides a 'Free Child' emotional resonance that supports the 'Adult' theological argument without being manipulative.",

      "Deconstruction of the 'Critical Parent' voice in traditional hymnody.",

    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The political references (Cheney/Rumsfeld) could potentially trigger a 'Crossed Transaction' for listeners in a different political ego-state, though here they serve as 'Adult' reality-testing."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use the 'therefore' logic to ground ethical demands in prior acceptance. This prevents the 'Bait & Switch' game where grace is promised but only law is delivered."
