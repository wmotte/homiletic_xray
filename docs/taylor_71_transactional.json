    "psychological_health_score": 6,
    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful mix of Nurturing Parent comfort and Adult social analysis. However, it reinforces a Parent-Child dynamic by framing the relationship with God as a 'contract' that can become 'null and void.' This creates a 'conditional' security that can foster Adapted Child anxiety (fear of not qualifying) rather than Free Child joy. The ending relies on 'postponed understanding' (by and by), which can keep the listener in a state of psychological dependency on the 'mysterious' Parent figure.",

      "The 'Contract' metaphor is highly legalistic (CP) and may undermine the message of grace.",
      "Over-reliance on the 'mystery' payoff can discourage present-day Adult problem solving."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to frame the 'Covenant' not as a legalistic contract that can be 'voided' (which triggers fear), but as a relationship that empowers the listener's Adult ego to act in the present. Reduce the use of 'must' and 'got to' to allow the listener to choose the path of faith autonomously."
