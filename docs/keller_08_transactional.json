It utilizes a 'scare tactic' by pathologizing normal human frustration ('grumbling') as a precursor to eternal damnation. While it offers comfort (NP), it first creates the anxiety it seeks to soothe. The impact is a high-dependency model where the listener is taught to distrust their own 'kardia' (heart).",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the listener's Adult ego regarding the *benefits* of patience rather than using the Critical Parent to threaten *condemnation* for impatience. Allow the Free Child more room to explore the 'joy' of patience without the shadow of the 'Judge at the door.'"
