It uses Transactional Analysis principles (unconsciously) to deconstruct the 'Critical Parent' voice often found in religious settings. By exposing the 'games' of self-righteousness and the 'Drama Triangle' of earning salvation, the preacher promotes authentic Adult-Adult communication between the pulpit and the pew.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I' statements to model the struggle with the Critical Parent, as this prevents the preacher from becoming a Persecutor of the self-righteous."
