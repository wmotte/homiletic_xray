In February of 1856, Charles Haddon Spurgeon on a Sunday morning in the New Park Street Church [...] When I kneel down at the lily-white throne and look at his nail-pierced feet, surrender my commission and thank him that he made me a preacher —a preacher down here —I shall cry once more, Christ lives!"

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon uses 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 as a springboard rather than a specific text to be unfolded. It quickly devolves into a general discourse on the Resurrection (the 'theme') rather than the specific logic of Paul's argument in this pericope. It fails to identify what is in THIS text that is nowhere else.",
      "quotes": [
        "I want to talk this evening about 'Three Days That Changed the World.'",
        "It was the preaching of the Resurrection... that first aroused the ire of the Council."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus on the specific vocabulary of the text: 'delivered', 'received', and especially the phrase 'according to the scriptures'. What does this specific apostolic traditioning mean that a general 'Christ lives' does not?"
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "There is almost no historical-critical or linguistic exegesis of the Corinthian context. The preacher spends more time on 19th-century church history (Spurgeon, Dale) and American history (Quebec, San Jacinto) than on the original setting of the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "In February of 1856, Charles Haddon Spurgeon...",
        "When you go to Quebec, they will carry you to the Plains of Abraham..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Investigate the 'paradosis' (tradition) Paul is quoting. Why did the Corinthian church need to hear this specific summary of the gospel?"
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The application is broad and rhetorical. While it mentions contemporary settings (Stemmons Freeway, offices), it remains at the level of a slogan ('Christ lives!') rather than a concrete ethical or spiritual direction for the hearer's life.",
      "quotes": [
        "As you travel along Stemmons Freeway here in Dallas, Christ lives!",
        "Let every faker in every high political office... know Christ lives!"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond the exclamation. How does the Resurrection specifically reorder the 'misery' of a Dallas office worker or a 'political faker'?"
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured as a thematic speech. It moves from historical anecdotes to a systematic review of atonement theories, then to a poetic meditation. The text is not 'expounded' and 'applied' in one movement; it is used as a motto.",
      "quotes": [
        "There are days... that alter the world.",
        "The first day—Friday... What did it all mean?"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Let the application arise directly from the grammatical structure of the Bible passage instead of imposing a 'Three Days' framework onto it."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon strongly emphasizes redemption and gratitude. Misery is present but somewhat individualized and 'softened' by poetic language. The preacher's personal testimony of surgery touches on misery but remains largely in the realm of victory.",
      "quotes": [
        "I know in some way... that he took a lick that was meant for me.",
        "I have just come through a great teaching and testing time... I have passed through surgery."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' aspect by connecting it to the 'lostness' mentioned in Thesis 6, rather than just personal 'testing'."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher explicitly mentions 'spirits in prison' and 'lost sheep,' but then retreats into agnosticism ('I do not know'). The 'two ways' are present as a concept but lack the sharp urgency Dekker demands regarding the possibility of being lost.",
      "quotes": [
        "I do not know the meaning of this cryptic passage that he went and preached to the spirits in prison...",
        "I have no warrant to preach a second probation, and I shall not."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "The preacher should take a clearer stance on the 'destination of man' as implied by the text's call to believe the gospel 'unless you believed in vain'."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "This is the sermon's strongest point. Christ is clearly the telos. The preacher maintains the divinity and lordship of Christ throughout, and the sermon culminates in a vision of Christ's eternal reign.",
      "quotes": [
        "Christ is the telos of the sermon... Christ lives!",
        "When I kneel down at the lily-white throne and look at his nail-pierced feet..."

      "improvement_point": "Ensure that 'Christ lives' is not just a psychological comfort but a theological reality that judges and saves."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 1850 words, the sermon likely clocks in just under the 20-minute threshold. While it has rhetorical 'breadth,' it lacks the 'depth' of exegetical labor Dekker requires.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Reduce historical anecdotes about Spurgeon and Quebec to make room for deeper engagement with the Greek text and its dogmatic implications."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker’s criteria primarily in its lack of specific exegetical depth and its tendency toward thematic oratory over textual exposition. It functions more as a rhetorical celebration of the Resurrection than a 'recreation' of the specific Word of God found in 1 Corinthians 15. While it is strongly Christocentric and avoids being purely objective, it relies too heavily on anecdotes and general truths.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christocentric focus where Christ is the clear telos of the message.",
      "Effective use of personal testimony to ground the 'gratitude' section.",
      "Avoids a purely intellectualized or 'objective' preaching style by involving the subject."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of specific exegesis; the original context and language are ignored.",
      "Thematic structure ('Three Days') overrides the specific logic of the Bible passage.",
      "Application remains largely rhetorical/slogan-based rather than concrete and contemporary."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "According to Dekker’s definition, this is an 'adequate' speech about the Gospel, but it struggles to be a 'sermon' because it fails to unfold what is unique to THIS specific text. It is a 5.5/10: it has the right goal (Christ) but lacks the necessary tools (exposition and specific application)."
