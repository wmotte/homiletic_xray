    "summary": "This is a remarkably healthy sermon from a TA perspective. It uses the Adult ego state to analyze real-world events and then invites the listener into an authentic, non-defensive posture. By defining sin as a theological rather than merely ethical concept, the preacher removes the 'Critical Parent' shame-cycle and replaces it with an 'Adult' reality-check followed by 'Free Child' relief. The preacher successfully avoids the 'Bait and Switch' game by ensuring grace is the foundation, not just the conclusion.",

      "Excellent use of Adult-Adult transactions through cultural examples.",

      "Slight risk of dismissing valid psychological trauma ('my father beat me') as mere 'squirming,' though the preacher qualifies this theologically."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue using 'we' language to maintain the Adult-Adult level. Ensure that when dismissing 'human reasons' for sin, you acknowledge their reality while maintaining their theological insufficiency to avoid sounding like a Persecutor."
