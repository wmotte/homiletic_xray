    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a clear, structural overview of Revelation 7, dividing it into three dramatic scenes. The exegetical 'Sache' is the transition from heavenly liturgy to the historical context of the 'great ordeal' (Roman persecution). The preacher correctly identifies the 'white robes' as baptismal imagery. However, the theological depth is somewhat flattened by a rapid transition from the eschatological vision to a specific socio-political critique. While the exegesis of the Greek 'thlipsis' (ordeal) is accurate, the 'blue' side becomes subservient to a very specific horizontal application. The Barthian 'Living Christ' is present as the Lamb, but primarily as a symbol for a specific ethical stance rather than the transcendent Subject of the Word.",

        "The text moves in three dramatic scenes.",

    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher begins with a high degree of self-revelation, framing the sermon as an 'act of great risk.' This creates an immediate sense of vulnerability and authenticity. There is a conscious effort to distance himself from 'religious nuts,' revealing a preference for intellectual and poetic interpretation over fundamentalist literalism. The 'green' side reveals a preacher who is deeply concerned with the current state of Western society and his own place within a 'privileged' demographic. The self-revelation is 'diaconal' in that it models the struggle of the listener, though it occasionally borders on a 'confession of the enlightened' rather than a confession of the sinner.",

        "I am about to commit an act of great risk.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined by a 'we-definition' that assumes a shared socio-economic and racial background ('those of us who have been white and male'). This creates a strong bond with a specific subset of the congregation but may unintentionally alienate those who do not fit that description. The tone is 'Teaching' and 'Solidary,' yet there is a subtle paternalism in the way the 'elder' is described as someone who 'makes sure nobody gets by with anything.' The preacher positions himself as a guide through the 'anguish,' speaking at eye level about shared losses, but the 'yellow' signal is heavily charged with a specific political frequency that could cause 'noise' for listeners with different views.",

        "I suspect there are a lot of Disciples of Christ there, because Disciples of Christ are among the best singers.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward 'Anspruch' (Demand). The 'Red' side dominates the second half, listing specific ethical imperatives: accepting regulation, welcoming immigrants, and ecological responsibility. While these are framed as 'baptismal identity,' they function as a moral checklist. The 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is relegated to the 'poetic fantasy' of the future, while the 'Law' is applied with concrete contemporary force. Theologically, this risks turning the Gospel into a new set of requirements for 'making it to the sing-fest.' The 'direction' is sender-to-receiver demand, putting significant pressure on the 'dutiful' listener to perform 'generative' actions to prove their baptism.",

        "Instead of refusing 'the other'... we take them as neighbors.",

    "overall_communication_score": 5.8,
    "summary": "This sermon is a professionally crafted piece of homiletical rhetoric that successfully bridges an ancient, difficult text with contemporary social anxieties. It excels in structure and clarity. However, from a Barthian and Schulz von Thun perspective, it suffers from an imbalance of the 'Four Sides.' The 'Red' side (Appeal) is so dominant and specific that it threatens to turn the 'Good News' into 'Good Advice.' Theologically, the sermon leans toward 'Synergism,' where the heavenly future is the result of 'courageous obedience' rather than the free gift of the Lamb. The 'Green' side is authentic, but the 'Yellow' side risks alienating those not already aligned with the preacher's socio-political presuppositions. It is a 'Satisfactory' sermon that fulfills the task of modern application but lacks the 'Theological Promise' (Zuspruch) that provides the 'Rest' Immink and Barth emphasize.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is significant psychologization of the 'ordeal.' The 'Great Tribulation' is transformed into the psychological 'anguish' of losing social privilege. God risks becoming an 'Object' that validates a specific ethical program.",

      "Excellent structural clarity.",
      "Effective use of baptismal imagery as a thread.",
      "Courageous engagement with difficult contemporary issues."

      "Increase the 'Zuspruch' (Promise) to ground the 'Anspruch' (Demand).",

      "Allow the 'Lamb' to be the Acting Subject of the sermon's climax."

    "conclusion": "A rhetorically strong but theologically 'legalistic' sermon that prioritizes ethical mobilization over the proclamation of the Gospel as a gift."
