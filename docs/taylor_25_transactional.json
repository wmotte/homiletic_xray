  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely avoids the manipulative traps of traditional homiletics. By starting in a Nurturing Parent position (comforting the listener), the preacher establishes a secure base before transitioning into a strong Adult-Adult dialogue regarding social justice and national ethics. The use of the 'Bait and Switch' is more of a rhetorical device than a psychological game, as it aims to expand the listener's awareness rather than exploit a weakness for a negative payoff. The preacher successfully avoids the 'Persecutor' role by using inclusive language ('we') and focusing on 'principles of judgment' rather than personal condemnation.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Adult-to-Adult engagement on difficult social issues.",
      "Avoidance of the 'Critical Parent' trap of shaming the congregation.",
      "High level of emotional intelligence in the opening 'tender' scenes."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The transition from the 'Upper Room' to 'Lyndon Johnson' is a sharp cognitive shift that could feel like a 'Con' to a sensitive listener.",
      "The 'Free Child' could be more present to offer a vision of the 'New Fellowship' that is not just ethical, but joyful."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' to maintain the Adult-Adult contract. Ensure the 'Bait' (the comfort) is presented as a preparation for the 'Confrontation' rather than a separate, disconnected reality, to minimize the feeling of a psychological 'Switch'."
