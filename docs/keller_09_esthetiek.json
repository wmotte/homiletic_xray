    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The imagery is functional and illustrative rather than evocative or poetic. Keller uses imagery primarily as a pedagogical tool to explain abstract concepts. He effectively employs the 'yoke' metaphor by grounding it in its historical and agricultural context, making the 'master/disciple' relationship concrete. However, the sermon lacks sensory richness; there is little 'painting' of the biblical scene. The imagery of the granddaughters ('Up! Up! Carry me') provides a warm, relatable human touch, but the overall language remains largely conceptual. It follows 'tell' more than 'show', using images to prove a point rather than to create an aesthetic experience of the text's world.",
      "quotes": [
        "A yoke was something you put on a beast of burden (a mule or an ox), and they carried wagons or plows.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Keller exhibits exceptional stewardship of language. He avoids 'Canaanite' jargon, or where he uses theological terms like 'justification' (implied) or 'sanctification', he translates them into the vernacular of 'self-censorship' and 'self-reproach'. His precision in defining the 'life lie' and the 'inner murmur' demonstrates a deep respect for the nuance of human psychology. The language is economical and hits the core of the urban listener's experience. There is a clear effort to do justice to the complexity of the hearer's secular framework while remaining tethered to the biblical text. This precision creates an aesthetic of 'intellectual honesty'.",
      "quotes": [
        "stilling the eternal inner murmur of self-reproach.",
        "I made the quality of my work the measure of my worth.",

      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Highly effective. Religious jargon is virtually absent; instead, secular 'jargon' (REM sleep, life lie, codependence) is used to bridge the gap to the gospel."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is clearly 'oral language', but it leans toward the didactic rather than the musical. The rhythm is that of a lecture or a persuasive argument—logical, staccato, and repetitive for emphasis. There is a lack of poetic cadence or rhetorical 'legato' that one might find in more liturgical or contemplative preaching. The use of hymns at the end provides a brief moment of lyrical beauty, but the body of the sermon is structurally 'flat' in terms of sound value. It is effective for communication but lacks the 'sober beauty' of rhythmic prose that sticks in the memory through its sound alone.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you’re living for your career, you are not a self-sufficient person. You’re yoked to your career.",

        "Avoid the repetitive 'You say... Jesus says...' structure which can become monotonous."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Oral language. It is clearly designed to be heard, not just read, though it sounds more like a talk than a proclamation."
    },
    "average_score_language": 6.33,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by 'clarity as beauty'. While it lacks the sensory richness of Wilson’s 'imagery' or the poetic rhythm of Grözinger, it excels in McEntyre’s 'stewardship of language'. Keller’s strength lies in his precise diagnosis of the human condition using contemporary metaphors. The language is sober, intellectual, and highly accessible, avoiding the kitsch of overly sentimental religious talk. It is an aesthetic of transparency, where the language aims to be a clear window into the logic of the gospel rather than a stained-glass window of sensory experience."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by upsetting the equilibrium—challenging the hearer's assumption of contentment. It moves through a 'complication' (we are all yoked to something) to a 'sudden shift' or turning point: the revelation of Jesus as the 'gentle Master' who was 'cosmically restless' on the cross. The movement from the 'life lie' to the 'rest of the soul' creates a palpable sense of progression. While it uses a 'three-point' structure, it functions more like a journey of discovery than a static list. The tension is maintained by the counter-intuitive nature of the 'yoke' until the resolution in the cross.",
      "quotes": [
        "We’re going to learn why we need rest, what rest is, and how to get rest.",
        "That’s so astounding in our culture, because our culture says...",
        "He had no rest on the cross. He was cosmically restless..."

      "strengths": [
        "Strong 'upsetting of the equilibrium' using secular poets and playwrights.",
        "The 'turning point' in the middle (the paradox of the yoke) is well-timed.",
        "The climax at the cross provides a satisfying theological and emotional resolution."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'three-point' announcement at the start is a bit 'academic' and can kill some narrative suspense.",

        "The conclusion could return more explicitly to the Horace/Ibsen opening to close the circle."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A dynamic journey disguised as a three-point structure. It moves from problem to solution with clear tension."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. Keller practices 'reframing' (Cilliers) by placing the ancient text of Matthew into the high-pressure context of Manhattan. He respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the yoke) while making it feel urgently relevant. The synthesis of Ibsen, Horace, and the New York Times with the words of Jesus creates a new 'optics' for the hearer. The hearer is forced to see their 'secular' workaholism as a 'religious' burden. This is a masterful example of 'the form of the sermon following the form of the text' as a witness to the contemporary world (Long).",
      "quotes": [
        "New York City was started as a trading post. It’s a place to make money.",
        "Judith Shulevitz wrote a great article in the New York Times Magazine...",
        "Jesus is not saying, “You’re independent; give up your independence and come to me.”"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of secular burnout as a 'yoke' of self-salvation.",
        "Seamless integration of high culture (Ibsen) and pop culture (Mr. Spock) with exegesis.",
        "The application flows naturally from the text's own logic rather than being 'tacked on'."

      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing. It offers a completely new lens through which to view urban ambition and restlessness."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is relatively 'closed' in its dogmatic structure, yet 'open' in its psychological invitation. Following Stark's 'Open Work of Art', the sermon is polyvalent in how it identifies various 'yokes' (career, children, morality), allowing different hearers to find themselves in the text. However, the conclusion is quite prescriptive and 'sealed' with a specific Reformed soteriology. While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' through the quotes of Stevens and Ibsen, it resolves these tensions perhaps a bit too neatly through the 'substitutionary' logic of the cross. It functions more as a 'persuasive witness' than an 'open exploration'.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus says, “I’m the only one who can actually give you a solution to that.”",
        "The minute you not only admit you’re helpless but also finally rest in his love...",
        "If you’re not a disciple, you’re not having this peace of God worked into every corner of your life."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The use of 'yoke' allows for multiple personal applications (polyvalence).",
        "Acknowledges the reality of doubt and the difficulty of believing in love.",
        "The ending invitation to 'discipleship' leaves the hearer with a path forward."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Allow the 'mystery' of the Father/Son relationship (v. 27) to breathe more without immediate explanation.",
        "Leave some questions for the hearer to ponder rather than answering every 'life lie' immediately.",
        "The ending could be more of an 'invitation to the table' rather than a 'summary of requirements'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Mostly closed/monovalent. It is a 'persuasive argument' that leads to a single, clear theological conclusion."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics of the sermon are robust and well-engineered. The 'dramaturgy of the soul' is central here, moving the hearer from the exhaustion of self-justification to the rest of grace. Keller’s use of 'reframing' is the structural engine, successfully bridging the gap between 1st-century Galilee and 21st-century New York. While the structure is somewhat traditional and 'closed' in its theological resolution, the narrative arc is dynamic and maintains tension by constantly challenging the hearer's cultural 'frames'."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by grounding 'rest' in the 'cosmic restlessness' of the cross. Keller does not offer 'immediate comfort'; he insists on the 'pain of the yoke' and the 'helplessness of the child'. The emotions evoked are authentic because they are tied to the 'shrunken or frozen soul' and the 'bloody sweat' of Gethsemane, rather than sentimental platitudes. By using Ibsen and Stevens, he acknowledges the 'morbid' reality of death and loss, refusing to 'smooth over' the human condition for a quick emotional fix.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None identified. The sermon actively deconstructs kitsch (the 'life lie')."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of Jesus' 'cosmic restlessness' on the cross as the source of our rest.",
      "The honest admission of the 'eternal inner murmur of self-reproach' that persists even in success."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this 'apologetic of the cross' which serves as a natural barrier against sentimentalism."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully 'opens space for grace' (Cilliers) by systematically closing off all other exits (the 'yokes' of career, family, and morality). By showing the 'heaviness' of human effort, the 'lightness' of Christ's yoke appears as true grace rather than a new law. The 'Space for Grace' is specifically created in the 'between' of our helplessness and Christ's finished work. While the sermon is highly structured, the emphasis on Jesus being 'gentle and humble in heart' prevents it from becoming a 'moralistic trap'. It invites the hearer into a 'Space' where they are seen as 'righteous and beautiful' in Christ.",
    "tension_sustained": "The tension between 'independence' and 'yoke' is sustained throughout until the very end.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of the cross is presented as the 'cosmic' solution, though the mechanics of substitution are explained quite logically.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. The 'must' of discipleship is framed as a response to the 'gift' of rest, not a condition for it.",
    "recommendation": "To increase the 'space', the preacher could spend more time on the 'revelation to little children' as an act of the Father's 'good pleasure' (v. 26), emphasizing the 'unavailability' of grace."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically strong example of 'Apologetic-Reframing'. Its beauty lies not in poetic flourish or sensory immersion, but in the 'sober beauty' of intellectual and spiritual precision. Keller functions as a 'steward of language', carefully choosing terms that resonate with a secular, urban audience while remaining faithful to the Reformed tradition. The structural arc is compelling, successfully moving from a phenomenological analysis of restlessness to a Christological proclamation of rest. The sermon avoids the 'kitsch' of easy answers by grounding its comfort in the 'cosmic' suffering of Christ. While it leans toward a 'closed' theological system, the 'space for grace' is effectively opened by the radical deconstruction of human self-justification. It is a 'witness' (Long) that uses the 'form of the culture' to reveal the 'form of the Gospel'.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the biblical 'yoke' within the context of modern urban burnout.",
      "High level of 'anti-kitsch' authenticity by grounding grace in the 'restlessness' of the cross.",
      "Precise stewardship of language that translates theological concepts into psychological reality."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase sensory imagery ('show, don't tell') to make the biblical scenes more vivid.",
      "Vary the rhetorical rhythm to move beyond the didactic 'lecture' style.",
      "Allow for more 'openness' and mystery in the conclusion, rather than a purely logical summary."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Apologetic-Reframing",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Anti-kitsch) and Thomas Long (Preacher as Witness).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'urban intellectuals', 'skeptics', and 'burned-out professionals' who value logic, psychological depth, and cultural relevance.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more narrative-driven structure that 'shows' a character's journey into rest.",
      "Use the 'musicality' of the text's own poetry (especially in the 'I praise you, Father' section) to create a more liturgical atmosphere.",
      "Incorporate more 'visual' metaphors from the arts or nature to balance the 'conceptual' metaphors."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a highly effective aesthetic event that achieves its purpose: making the 'rest' of Christ palpable to a 'restless' audience. It excels in the 'micro-aesthetics' of precision and the 'macro-aesthetics' of reframing. While it could benefit from more poetic 'imaging', its intellectual honesty and rejection of religious kitsch create a powerful 'Space for Grace'. It stands as a model for how the 'Aesthetic Turn' can be applied within a confessional Reformed framework without losing theological 'sharpness'."
