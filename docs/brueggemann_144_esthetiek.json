    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes strong, evocative imagery that contrasts the 'routine' with the 'outrageous.' It succeeds in 'painting the picture' of the slain yet ruling lamb and the transformation of clothing—from 'funeral cloths' to 'clothes of joy.' The imagery of the 'lid' on singing for the affluent provides a concrete visual for an abstract sociological point. However, some imagery remains slightly derivative of the biblical texts themselves rather than creating entirely new metaphors. The '7-11' praise hymn metaphor is a sharp, contemporary image that effectively 'shows' the vacuity of certain religious practices. The sensory transition from the 'stench' of Friday to the 'light' of Sunday is palpable.",

        "money and our learning have put the lid on our singing",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and avoids 'Canaanite' jargon by redefining theological terms through a socio-political lens. Words like 'doxology,' 'vulnerability,' and 'status quo' are used with surgical intent. The preacher practices 'stewardship of language' by naming specific denominations and their singing habits, avoiding vague generalities. The distinction between 'settled logic' and 'playful, imaginative, daring speech' shows a high level of linguistic awareness. The precision in describing Paul as an 'angry truth-squad' provides a fresh, non-jargonized entry into a familiar story. Every word feels weighted and intentional, serving the larger rhetorical goal of 'reframing' the act of singing.",

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon is highly musical, mirroring its subject matter. It employs classic rhetorical devices such as anaphora ('Such singing evokes...') and parallelism ('Sunday love where there is Friday hatred'). The rhythm varies effectively between short, punchy sentences and longer, flowing cadences. The use of the St. Francis prayer and the rhythmic listing of Paul's 'singing' moments creates a liturgical 'flow' that makes the text feel like a performance. It is clearly written for the ear, with a natural 'staccato' in the opening sociology and a 'legato' in the closing doxology. The repetition of 'myriads of myriads' mimics the very abundance it describes.",
      "quotes": [
        "Sunday love where there is Friday hatred; Sunday pardon where there is Friday injury",
        "Such singing evokes thanks... Such singing evokes praise... Such singing evokes freedom",

    "average_score_language": 7.67,
    "summary_language": "The language is rhetorically sophisticated, blending sociological observation with poetic biblical interpretation. It avoids the 'kitsch' it critiques by using sharp, precise metaphors and a rhythmic structure that demands to be heard rather than just read. The 'stewardship of language' is evident in the careful choice of verbs and the avoidance of religious platitudes. The imagery is vivid, particularly in the juxtaposition of the 'slain lamb' and the 'ruling lamb,' creating a 'cinematic' quality that allows the hearer to 'see' the transformation of reality through the act of singing."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot.' It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with a critique of routine, affluent singing. It then moves through three 'scenes': the cosmic end-time (Revelation), the historical transformation (Paul), and the personal/ordinary experience (Psalm 30). This movement from the 'macro' to the 'micro' creates a sense of narrowing focus that involves the hearer directly. The turning point is the 'Easter interruption' that shifts the sermon from a critique of sociology to a proclamation of grace. The energy remains high, though the three-point structure (Revelation, Acts, Psalm) risks feeling slightly static if not for the unifying theme of 'singing.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The thesis is this: the more affluent and sophisticated we are, the more feebly we sing.",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a hallmark of the sermon: 'reframing' the biblical text within the context of modern empire, greed, and social justice. The preacher connects the 'lamb' of Revelation to the vulnerability of civil rights workers and anti-apartheid resisters, making the ancient text an 'operative reality.' The 'strangeness' of the Easter claim is not smoothed over but highlighted as a 'violation of ordinary reason.' The synthesis between the 'routine' of an Episcopal service and the 'outrage' of the Gospel is masterfully handled. It doesn't just apply the text; it uses the text to provide a new 'optics' for viewing the act of congregational singing.",
      "quotes": [
        "Singing Easter is an act of defiance against every empire and every controlling regime.",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is rhetorically powerful, it leans toward a 'closed' structure in its didactic moments. The preacher tells the congregation exactly what their singing means and why they (the affluent) don't do it well. However, it remains an 'open work' in its use of poetry and song, inviting the hearer to 'imagine' a different world. The conclusion is an invitation ('imagine, the next time you open the hymnal'), which leaves the 'appropriation' to the hearer. There is room for the 'ambivalence of existence' in the discussion of 'Friday hatred' and 'funeral cloths,' but the resolution is quite firm. It is more of a 'witness' than a 'teacher,' which preserves some openness.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is an artistic presentation of a world other than the one that is in front of us.",
        "imagine, the next time you open the hymnal",

    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are characterized by a strong narrative arc that moves from a critique of the 'status quo' to a vision of 'new life.' The integration of text and context is superior, using the concept of 'reframing' to turn a routine liturgical act into a dangerous political and spiritual event. While the structure is clear and logical, it avoids being a dry three-point sermon by maintaining a 'dramaturgical' tension between the 'Friday' of the world and the 'Sunday' of God. It creates a 'space for grace' by insisting on the possibility of transformation."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon explicitly critiques kitsch ('7-11' songs, security-report-like clarity). It avoids religious kitsch by refusing 'cheap comfort.' It sustains the tension of 'Friday'—hatred, injury, doubt, and death—before moving to 'Sunday.' The emotion is authentic because it is rooted in the 'pain of suffering' (mentioning persecution, violence, and 'Sheol'). It does not offer a 'happy ending' as a cliché, but as a 'defiant act' that requires courage. The use of the St. Francis prayer and the Civil Rights examples grounds the emotion in historical reality rather than sentimentalism.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The mention of '7-11' praise hymns as a form of domesticated, repetitive kitsch.",
      "The critique of singing that sounds like a 'security report'—clear but devoid of passion."

      "The acknowledgment of 'market collapse or the fear of terror' as real sources of dismay.",
      "The description of the 'slain lamb' as a figure of ultimate vulnerability."

    "recommendation": "To maintain this high anti-kitsch level, continue to ground 'joy' in the specific 'mourning' it replaces, avoiding the temptation to let the 'Sunday' victory feel inevitable or easy."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace through the concept of 'interruption.' The Paul story is presented not as a moral achievement but as an 'abrupt appearance' of Jesus. The sermon emphasizes that grace is 'outrageous' and 'violates ordinary reason,' which protects it from being reduced to a human task. However, the sociological critique at the start slightly 'closes' the space for those who might feel judged for their 'feeble' singing. Overall, the sermon respects the mystery of the 'Lamb' and the 'unavailable' power of God that turns mourning into dancing.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between 'Friday' and 'Sunday' are sustained; the 'slain' nature of the lamb is never forgotten even in his 'ruling.'",
    "mystery_respected": "The sermon explicitly states that the news is 'too hidden for prose,' respecting the mystery of the resurrection.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails, though it is a 'dangerous' grace that demands a response of 'defiance.'",
    "recommendation": "Soften the sociological judgment to ensure that grace feels available even to the 'sophisticated' hearer who struggles to sing."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'Reframing' (Cilliers) and 'Imagery' (Wilson). It succeeds by taking a mundane liturgical reality—hymn singing—and placing it within a cosmic and political drama. The poetics of the language are sharp, rhythmic, and intentionally provocative, avoiding the 'kitsch' of easy religious sentiment. The structural dramaturgy effectively moves the hearer from a state of 'routine' to a state of 'imagination' and 'defiance.' It is a 'performance' of the very energy it describes, using the sound and rhythm of the words to evoke the 'outrage' of Easter. While the sociological opening is a bit prescriptive, the overall movement is toward an 'open' vision of God's transformative power. The sermon does not just 'tell' the congregation to sing; it 'shows' them a world where singing is the only logical response to a God who turns death to life.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of singing as a political and spiritual act of defiance.",
      "High linguistic precision and rhythmic musicality (stewardship of language).",
      "Strong anti-kitsch stance that honors the 'Friday' reality of suffering."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The sociological critique of denominations could be perceived as 'closed' or judgmental.",
      "The Trump reference, while 'vivid,' may distract from the timelessness of the 'Lamb' imagery.",
      "The transition between the three biblical 'scenes' could be more organic."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Prophetic-Poetic / Narrative-Dramatic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits the 'Reframing' and 'Space for Grace' model of Johan Cilliers, with the 'Imagery' focus of Paul Scott Wilson.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to hearers who are weary of 'routine' religion and are looking for a faith that engages with the 'real world' of politics and pain.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Explore more 'polyphonic' spaces where silence or soft singing also holds grace.",
      "Deepen the sensory imagery of the 'new world' being imagined.",
      "Experiment with a less linear 'three-point' structure to increase dramaturgical tension."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically successful 'event' that honors the Reformed tradition's focus on the Word while embracing the 'aesthetic turn.' It demonstrates that 'how' we speak of Easter—with rhythm, defiance, and imagination—is inseparable from the 'what' of the resurrection message. It avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by grounding its 'joy' in the 'mourning' of the world, ultimately opening a space for the 'outrageous' grace of God to be heard and felt."
