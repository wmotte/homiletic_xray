  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Grace-based Legalism.' It uses a high-functioning Adult ego state to build a logical case for spiritual growth, but psychologically relies on the Critical Parent to enforce 'diligence.' While it offers significant comfort (Nurturing Parent), it creates a psychological trap by stating that while works don't save you, a lack of visible growth ('ineffectiveness') calls your entire salvation into question. This can trigger 'Adapted Child' anxiety in the listener.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'No Excuses' rhetoric is a heavy Critical Parent move that can shut down the Free Child.",
      "The 'Investment' metaphor frames the relationship with God as a transactional business deal (A-A) rather than a relational one."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To avoid the 'Bait & Switch,' ensure that the 'effort' required is framed as a response of the Free Child's joy rather than the Adapted Child's fear of being 'ineffective' or 'blind'."
