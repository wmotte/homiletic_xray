Instead, it uses the 'Adult' to analyze the human condition and the 'Nurturing Parent' to offer a safe framework for the difficult work of repentance. By linking high theology to concrete family dynamics, it moves from abstract dogma to actionable, healthy relational change. The preacher successfully navigates the tension between the 'sternness' of the message and the 'autonomy' of the listener.",
    "strengths": [
      "High Adult engagement through psychological and historical data.",
      "Vulnerability of the preacher (admitting to 'domesticating Advent').",
      "Clear exit from the Drama Triangle by emphasizing personal responsibility over guilt."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Fall on your knees' refrain can occasionally trigger a regressive Child response if not balanced by the Adult context.",
      "The transition from the 'cut-and-fill' road metaphor to 'family breakdown' is a bit abrupt."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' and 'I' to ensure the preacher remains in the same boat as the congregation, preventing a shift into the Persecutor role."
