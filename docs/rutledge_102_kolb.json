      "analysis": "The sermon is notably weak in facilitating concrete, lived experience. It lacks a 'hook' that connects with the hearer's daily life or recognizable human situations. Instead of inviting the hearer to identify with the disciples' confusion or awe through sensory language, it approaches the text from a liturgical and historical distance. The experience is primarily intellectual rather than emotional or situational.",

However, it lacks a deep exploration of the hearer's internal resistance to glory or the 'why' behind our modern discomfort with 'holy fear.' It observes the problem of 'untrained readers' and 'moralistic preaching' rather than the existential condition of the congregation.",

It lacks a strong Concrete Experience, failing to ground the lofty concept of 'uncreated light' in the recognizable life-world of the hearer. While it offers a strong Reflective Observation regarding the state of modern homiletics, it does so from a critical distance. The Abstract Conceptualization is the sermon's peak, offering rich, scholarly exegesis and dogmatic clarity. However, the Active Experimentation is largely confined to the liturgical sphere, leaving the ethical and daily implications of the Transfiguration underdeveloped. It primarily serves the 'Assimilating' learner, while leaving the 'Accommodating' learner behind.",

    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong example of a 'Declarative' approach, characterized by intellectual rigor and prophetic concern for theological integrity. From a Kolb perspective, however, it is incomplete. It functions as an excellent theological essay but misses the 'Concrete Experience' necessary to hook the modern hearer and the 'Active Experimentation' required to transform daily life. It is a 'Head' sermon that needs more 'Heart' and 'Hands' to achieve holistic impact. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the 'uncreated light' of the mountaintop and the 'hard knocks' of the valley through specific, lived-out application."
