  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a clear exegetical frame centered on John 11. The 'Sache' is the reversal of the human proverb 'seeing is believing' into the divine 'believing is seeing'. There is a strong emphasis on the 'finality' of death (Kaput! Finis!) to highlight the theological weight of the miracle. However, the dogmatic depth remains somewhat on the surface; the preacher explains the context of the Lazarus story well but avoids the complex Christological tensions of the Johannine signs, focusing instead on the emotional and existential weight of the narrative. The 'blue' side serves as a stage for the existential encounter rather than an end in itself.",
      "quotes": [
        "The word death does not occur in the dictionary of eternity.",
        "In the country which was native to our Lord... there is no word for death.",

        "The transition from the 'second mile' to Lazarus is slightly abrupt."

      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The language is accessible, using relatable metaphors like 'Missouri' and 'Missouri' logic."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a soul that is deeply acquainted with the 'terrifyingly earnest' nature of Jesus. There is an authentic admission of the struggle of faith—that Jesus 'repels' as much as he 'attracts'. This is not a preacher performing piety, but one who admits that the Gospel 'cuts against the grain' of his own makeup. The mention of a late friend's funeral adds a layer of personal history and vulnerability without becoming self-indulgent. The 'I' is used to model the struggle of the 'We'.",
      "quotes": [
        "I think if we will look squarely at ourselves... we will discover... that the Lord Jesus both attracts and repels us.",
        "It takes a lot of grace for us to even begin to deal with what Jesus tells us.",
        "I had started to say severe, but that is not the right word."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive (in the psychological sense of seeking closeness/harmony). The preacher emphasizes the 'attraction' and 'repulsion' of relationship and focuses heavily on the 'tears of God' and 'friendship'.",
      "diaconal_quality": "The self-revelation is diaconal; it serves to validate the listener's own resistance to the demands of Christ.",
      "strengths": [

        "Avoidance of 'super-Christian' posturing."

    },
    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is one of a shared journey. The preacher uses 'we' and 'us' consistently, placing himself under the same Word as the congregation. There is a sense of 'solidary teaching'. However, there is a slight paternalistic tone in the way he explains 'human terms' versus 'divine terms', almost as if the congregation needs to be gently corrected for their 'shrewdness and slickness'. The tone is one of 'earnest invitation' rather than 'authoritative command'.",
      "quotes": [
        "If you will look at your own Christian life carefully enough...",
        "We, with our shrewdness and our slickness...",
        "This leaves us utterly defenseless."

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The appeal is subtle. It is not a call to moral action (Law), but a call to a shift in perception (Faith). The 'Anspruch' (demand) is to believe before seeing. The preacher successfully grounds the appeal in the 'Zuspruch' (promise) that God is 'final' and has 'access to capability'. However, the sermon ends on a somewhat generic 'conquerors' note, which might leave the 'appeal ear' wondering what specifically 'venturing forth' looks like in Monday-morning reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "The lesson for us is that we must never believe that there are circumstances... that lie beyond the authority... of the eternal God.",
        "So believing and so trusting and so venturing forth...",

      ],
      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Balanced, but the promise (God's passibility and power) is the stronger element.",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Low. The focus is on trust and the nature of God rather than human effort.",
      "strengths": [
        "The appeal is rooted in the character of God.",
        "Avoids 'to-do list' preaching."
      ],

        "The final appeal is a bit abstract ('venturing forth into our future')."

    "disruptions": "The transition from the 'second mile' ethics to the 'Lazarus' miracle is a slight cognitive leap that creates minor factual noise.",
    "healing_disruption": "The disruption occurs when the preacher claims Jesus 'repels' us. This shatters the 'sweet Jesus' image to make room for the 'imperious' Christ."

    "the_appeal_ear_hears": "I must trust God even when things look 'kaput' and decomposed.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a solid example of existential homiletics. It successfully bridges the psychological gap between the listener's 'natural grain' and the 'supernatural logic' of the Gospel. The preacher uses the Schulz von Thun 'Green' side effectively by admitting the 'repulsion' of Christ, which builds a bridge of authenticity to the listener. Theologically, it follows a Barthian trajectory by emphasizing that God is the 'Acting Subject' who is not limited by human finality. The 'Yellow' side is warm and inclusive, though it occasionally leans into a teaching authority that borders on the paternal. The 'Red' side (Appeal) is the weakest, as it dissolves into a somewhat vague triumphant conclusion. However, the core message—that believing is the prerequisite for seeing—is communicated with clarity and emotional weight.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a slight risk of psychologizing the 'tears of God' as a human-like emotional response, though the preacher saves this by calling it the 'passibility of the Eternal'.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Authentic admission of the 'repulsion' of Christ.",
      "Strong linguistic imagery regarding the 'dictionary of eternity'.",
      "Effective use of the 'we' perspective."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Sharpen the transition between the ethical examples and the miracle narrative.",
      "Provide more concrete 'venturing' examples for the appeal.",
      "Deepen the Christological 'why' of the glory of God."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively honest and theologically sound sermon that respects the 'four ears' of the congregation while maintaining the 'Sache' of the Gospel."
