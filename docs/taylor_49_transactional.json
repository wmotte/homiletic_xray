    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of using high-level intellectual 'Adult' content as a 'Con' to lead the listener into a 'Child' state of emotional dependency. While the social commentary is astute, it is used to build a sense of 'Ain't It Awful' despair that only the preacher's theological solution can fix. The use of shaming language ('brutish') to elicit an emotional response to the crucifixion is a hallmark of the Critical Parent.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [

      "Promotion of passivity and 'Victim' status in the face of grief."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try to maintain the Adult-Adult transaction when discussing the cross. Instead of asking if the listener is 'brutish' for not feeling a certain way, invite them to reflect on how the 'mind of Christ' can be practically applied to their own agency and choices."
