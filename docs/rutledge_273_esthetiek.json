      "analysis": "The sermon excels in creating a vivid 'optics' as advocated by Cilliers. It avoids abstract theological jargon in favor of concrete, sensory details that bridge the gap between the 1st-century text and 20th-century experience. The preacher 'paints the picture' of the wedding not just as a religious event, but as a social catastrophe involving 'taste buds' and 'filet mignon.' The use of the New York Review of Books personal ad provides a sharp, poignant image of human longing that functions as a modern metaphor for the 'empty jars.' The imagery of the 'bottomless glass' and the calculation of 2,160 glasses of wine makes the miracle tactile and overwhelming, moving from 'telling' about grace to 'showing' its abundance through mathematical and sensory scale.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is characterized by what McEntyre calls 'stewardship.' There is a clear avoidance of 'Canaanite' jargon until the very end. The preacher uses precise, evocative vocabulary ('ruefully,' 'foibles,' 'pedestrian,' 'conspicuous consumption'). The analysis of the word 'Woman' in Jesus' address to Mary shows a commitment to linguistic nuance, explaining the distance without falling into defensive sentimentality. However, the precision wavers slightly in the conclusion, where the language becomes more conventional and less 'carved' than the opening sections. The use of the personal ad is a masterclass in selecting a precise cultural 'text' to illuminate a spiritual reality.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a sophisticated cadence, likely reflecting the preacher's familiarity with the Book of Common Prayer's rhythmic prose. There is a conscious variation in sentence length—short, punchy sentences ('It was a catastrophe.') are followed by longer, reflective periods. The use of parallelism ('She insists on nothing. She suggests nothing. She demands nothing.') creates a liturgical rhythm that reinforces the characterization of Mary. The 'flow' is natural for oral delivery, avoiding the 'paper language' of academic lectures. The repetition of the phrase 'There should have been more to it all' acts as a rhythmic refrain that anchors the sermon's movement.",

    "summary_language": "The language is aesthetically sophisticated, characterized by a 'sober beauty' that avoids religious kitsch. The preacher demonstrates excellent stewardship of words, selecting cultural touchstones (Piaf, Eliot, NYRB) that resonate with an educated, perhaps slightly cynical, audience. The imagery is concrete and sensory, successfully 'showing' the abundance of grace through the metaphor of wine. While the conclusion drifts toward more conventional homiletic prose, the overall micro-aesthetics are high, prioritizing precision and evocative power over abstract dogmatism."

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Following Lowry’s 'Homiletical Plot,' the sermon begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' through the theme of regret and the 'creeping chill' of unfulfilled dreams. It introduces a conflict: the human 'thirst' versus the 'empty jars' of ritual and secular escape. The movement from the secular memorial service to the wedding at Cana is seamless. The 'turning point' is the realization of the sheer volume of wine—the move from 'not enough' to 'more than enough.' The tension is sustained by delaying the 'solution' until the preacher has fully explored the 'catastrophe' of the empty wine skin. The conclusion offers a resolution that links the biblical event to the hearer's present 'regret.'",
      "quotes": [
        "I wondered aloud; isn’t regret a part of life?",

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a prime example of Cilliers' 'reframing.' The preacher uses the context of affluent, mid-life American dissatisfaction ('means and mien') to reframe the miracle at Cana. The biblical 'jars of purification' are not just ancient artifacts but are integrated as metaphors for modern 'religious attempts' and 'self-help' that fail to satisfy. The 'strangeness' of Jesus' response to Mary is respected and used to highlight the 'otherness' of God's timing. The synthesis is organic; the 'bottomless glass' of the gospel is presented as the only answer to the 'empty glass' of the secular personals. It avoids the 'springboard' trap by staying deeply rooted in the Johannine text while speaking directly to the 1998 context.",
      "quotes": [
        "Doesn’t this illustrate the paradox of affluent America today? — amidst our obsessive piling up of possessions... we suffer from a sense that we are still hungry.",

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon begins as a very 'open work of art' (Stark), inviting the hearer into the shared human experience of regret and longing. It acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' through the personal ads and the secular memorial. However, as the sermon progresses toward the conclusion, it becomes more 'closed.' The theological interpretation of the wine as 'Jesus' gift of himself' is presented with traditional authority, leaving less room for the hearer's own appropriation. The ending is quite 'sealed' with a series of 'the only One' statements. While this provides clarity, it reduces the polyvalence established in the first half of the sermon.",
      "quotes": [
        "I wondered aloud; isn’t regret a part of life? We all agreed that it was.",
        "There are a lot of things going on at a lot of different levels...",

    "average_score_structure": 7.33,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are strong, featuring a clear narrative arc that moves from the 'empty glass' of human regret to the 'bottomless glass' of divine grace. The integration of text and context is the sermon's greatest structural strength, using contemporary cultural artifacts to reframe the ancient miracle. While the sermon starts with significant openness and polyvalence, it moves toward a more traditional, closed homiletic conclusion. The dramaturgy is effective, sustaining tension until the 'revelation' of the wine's abundance, though the personal digression near the end slightly disrupts the momentum."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon successfully avoids religious kitsch by taking human pain and 'regret' seriously. It does not offer a 'happy ending' that ignores the 'creeping chill' of mortality. By using T.S. Eliot and the poignant NYRB ad, the preacher grounds the sermon in authentic emotion rather than sentimentality. The 'miracle' is not presented as a magic trick to solve all problems, but as a 'sign' of a different reality. The refusal to 'smooth over' Jesus' difficult words to Mary further protects the sermon from the 'pre-chewed' quality of kitsch. The only slight lean toward kitsch is in the very final sentences, which use somewhat standard 'churchy' tropes, but the preceding 90% is rigorously authentic.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [

  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'reframing' of the wine. By emphasizing the staggering quantity (2,160 glasses), the preacher creates a 'space' for the 'more than enough' quality of God's action. The sermon sustains the tension of human 'thirst' for a significant duration before introducing the 'solution.' However, the space is slightly constricted by the preacher's move toward dogmatic certainty in the final paragraph. The 'mystery' of the water becoming wine is respected (the preacher calls it 'not easy to explain'), which allows the 'Holy' to happen without being fully domesticated by logic.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tension is well-sustained through the exploration of 'regret' and the 'failure' of ritual water.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, the preacher acknowledges the 'different levels' and 'discrepancies' in the text.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the wine is a 'gift of himself,' not a reward for the host's efforts.",

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the 'New Homiletic' influenced by literary and narrative sensibilities. Its primary strength lies in its 'micro-aesthetics'—the careful, precise use of language and the deployment of vivid, contemporary imagery to reframe a well-known biblical narrative. The preacher avoids the 'kitsch' of easy comfort by lingering in the reality of human regret, using secular sources (Piaf, Eliot, NYRB) to validate the hearer's experience before introducing the 'abundance' of the Gospel. Structurally, the sermon follows a clear narrative arc, though it loses some of its 'open work' quality in a more traditional, declarative conclusion. The 'sober beauty' of the prose and the mathematical concrete-ness of the miracle's scale make the grace of God feel tangible rather than abstract. It is a sophisticated performance that respects the intelligence of the hearer while leading them toward a specific theological 'sign.'",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional integration of contemporary cultural 'texts' (NYRB ad) with the biblical narrative.",
      "Vivid, sensory imagery that 'shows' the abundance of grace through the volume of wine.",
      "Authentic engagement with the 'shadow side' of human experience (regret, failure) without resorting to kitsch."

    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The conclusion could be more 'open,' allowing the imagery to resonate rather than closing with dogmatic summaries.",
      "The personal introduction ('This is my first visit...') disrupts the established dramaturgical flow.",

    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Space for Grace) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Show don't tell).",
    "audience_analysis": "Educated, middle-to-upper-class hearers who appreciate literary references and are skeptical of 'easy' religious answers.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer at the 'banquet table' rather than a final summary.",
      "Integrate personal remarks into the narrative flow rather than as a separate block.",
      "Continue the high level of sensory detail into the final theological application."
    ],
    "conclusion": "An aesthetically strong sermon that demonstrates how 'form is content.' By using the 'bottomless glass' as both a title and a central metaphor, the preacher successfully creates a space where the abundance of Christ's glory is not just discussed but visualized. It is a model of how to use secular 'longing' as a bridge to sacred 'abundance' without sacrificing the integrity of either. While the ending is slightly more 'closed' than the aesthetic turn might suggest, the overall impact is one of profound 'reframing' and authentic depth."
