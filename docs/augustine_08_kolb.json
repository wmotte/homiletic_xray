    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon attempts to evoke experience through vivid liturgical imagery and sensory language ('dazzling light', 'throb with happiness'). However, it lacks contemporary 'slices of life' or recognizable human situations from the hearer's daily world. The experience is strictly ecclesiastical and mystical rather than grounded in the mundane reality of the listener. Identification with characters is limited to the 'Good Thief' and the 'Apostles' in a very stylized manner.",

      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "Reflective observation is the weakest phase. The sermon moves almost immediately to celebration without pausing to explore the 'why' of the human condition or the complexity of the problem. There is a brief mention of 'dark night of struggling' and 'chains of sin', but these are treated as already resolved rather than subjects for reflection. The 'problem' of death and sin is stated as a fact rather than explored as a human experience.",

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon is strong in theological formulation, though it relies heavily on biblical catena (chains of quotes) rather than systematic argumentation. It successfully connects the event of the Resurrection to a wider theological framework: the renewal of creation, the defeat of the 'accuser', and the transition from the Old Law to the New. The 'big idea' is the totalizing effect of the Resurrection on all levels of existence (heaven, earth, netherworld).",

    "phase_4_active_experimentation": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The application remains largely internal and liturgical. The call to action is to 'rejoice', 'offer gifts', and 'convert'. There is one specific ethical instruction regarding clothing and 'dignity' in §4, which provides a rare moment of concrete application. However, the sermon lacks specific 'how-to' steps for the hearer's life outside the church walls. The experimentation is more about participating in the ritual than changing daily behavior.",
      "quotes": [

    "summary": "The sermon is a strong example of visionary, liturgical preaching that prioritizes the 'Diverging' learning style. It fails to complete the Kolb cycle primarily due to a lack of deep reflective observation and concrete active experimentation. The preacher excels at creating a sense of 'awe' and 'joy' through high-register metaphors and biblical typology, but this remains largely disconnected from the listener's daily reality. The 'problem' of sin and death is treated as a theological category already defeated, rather than an existential reality that requires reflection. Consequently, the sermon is highly inspirational but lacks the practical 'handles' necessary for transformative adult learning. It addresses the 'heart' and 'imagination' effectively but leaves the 'hands' and the 'analytical mind' underserved.",

      "End with a 'Monday morning' application that translates 'conversion' into a specific habit or action."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a clear, effective piece of visionary rhetoric that serves its liturgical purpose well. However, from a Kolb perspective, it is an incomplete learning cycle. It functions more as a 'hymn in prose' than a transformative learning experience. The priority for improvement is to ground the high-flying theological visions in the 'low-flying' realities of the congregation's daily lives. By adding reflective depth and practical application, the preacher could move from merely 'inspiring' the congregation to 'equipping' them for the Christian life."
