    "summary": "While theologically orthodox in a traditional Pauline sense, the sermon is psychologically regressive. it systematically deconstructs the listener's 'Adult' agency ('we have no power') to induce a 'Not-OK' Child state. By using the 'Bait & Switch' game, the preacher creates a psychological vacuum of guilt and helplessness that only his specific religious 'food' can fill. This creates a cycle of dependency rather than spiritual maturity or autonomy.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as 'Adults' who are capable of making observations about their own lives. Instead of 'Why are you so neglectful?' (CP), ask 'What factors in our current environment make it difficult to remain disciplined?' (Adult). This invites cooperation rather than submission."
