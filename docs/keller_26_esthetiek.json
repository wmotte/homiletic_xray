    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in translating abstract theological concepts into sensory and cultural images. Keller uses the 'physical' as a bridge to the 'metaphysical,' particularly through the lens of C.S. Lewis. The imagery of the 'fountain-head' versus 'lower reaches' of a stream provides a tactile sense of divine pleasure. However, the imagery is often borrowed (Lewis) or analytical rather than purely poetic. It follows Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' by illustrating the decay of beauty through the 'size 3 model' anecdote, making the precariousness of life visible. While effective, the imagery serves the argument more than the atmosphere, leaning towards the 'cinematic' in its clarity but remaining tethered to logical progression.",
      "quotes": [
        "The energies which God’s creative rapture implanted in matter when he made the worlds are what we now call physical pleasures.",
        "Beautiful flowers … They are going to be in the ground decaying soon, and they’re only on a slightly faster path than you and me.",
        "What would it be to taste at the fountain-head that stream of which even these lower reaches prove so intoxicating?"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Effective use of 'secular' imagery (the aging model, the New York Times) to illustrate biblical truths.",
        "Strong sensory contrast between the 'solid' world and the 'energy in motion' of modern physics.",

    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "Keller demonstrates exceptional stewardship of language, consistent with McEntyre’s criteria. He avoids 'Canaanite jargon' by redefining terms like 'portion,' 'cup,' and 'gods' for a modern ear. The precision is seen in his distinction between 'believing in God' and 'running after God.' He nuances the human experience of aging and intellectual obsolescence with a surgical clarity that avoids platitudes. The language is economical; every sentence serves the building of the case. There is a clear effort to do justice to the complexity of skepticism without becoming vague or dismissive, treating the hearer as a 'mature conversation partner' (Stark).",
      "quotes": [
        "To run after means to pant. See, you have to live for something.",
        "Things that were written in the New York Times on the editorial page 20 years ago are now seen as hateful, obscene, primitive, horrible stuff.",
        "You have done God, but you’ve been running after those other things."

      "strengths": [
        "High degree of precision in defining 'idolatry' without using the word, making it accessible.",
        "Avoidance of religious clichés; instead, he uses 'secular' vocabulary to describe 'sacred' realities.",
        "Careful nuance in addressing the 'rational and scientific' objections of the audience."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The language can occasionally feel overly clinical or 'lecture-like' in its precision.",
        "Introduce more 'loving language' (McEntyre) that moves beyond the diagnostic to the purely consolatory.",
        "Vary the vocabulary in the final section to avoid the repetitive use of 'evidence' and 'rational'."

    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The rhythm is that of a skilled teacher or trial lawyer. It has a staccato cadence that aids clarity and 'oral event' (Immink) dynamics. There is a repetitive use of 'nothing in this world' which creates a liturgical weight, building a sense of 'shakability.' However, the musicality is limited by its didactic purpose. It lacks the 'legato' of poetic reflection; the sentences are functional. While it 'listens' well due to its logical flow, it rarely rises to the level of 'sober beauty' or poetic prose. The rhythm is driven by the 'plot' of the argument rather than the 'sound' of the words.",
      "quotes": [
        "There’s nothing in this world that will last. There’s nothing in this world that won’t be shaken and pass away. Everything in this world is passing away.",
        "In your face there’s joy upon joy upon joy, and at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.",
        "It would change the way you went to every funeral. It would change the way you wept every one of your tears."

        "Soften the 'staccato' logic with more lyrical passages to allow for emotional 'breathing room'.",
        "The rhythm is somewhat predictable; more 'syncopation' or surprising turns in sentence structure would enhance the aesthetic."

      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Distinctly oral language; it is clearly designed to be heard and processed in real-time."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7,
    "summary_language": "The language is characterized by a 'sober beauty' and high intellectual precision. It avoids kitsch by refusing to use pre-chewed religious sentiment, opting instead for a rigorous 'stewardship of words.' The imagery is effective but functional, serving the 'reframing' of reality. While it lacks the high-poetic musicality of some traditions, its clarity and lack of jargon make it an aesthetically honest 'open work' that respects the hearer's intellect."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by 'upsetting the equilibrium' with the existential threat of a world without foundations (physics, philosophy, emotion). This creates a 'trouble' that demands a 'refuge.' The movement from 'Why' to 'How' provides a dynamic journey. The turning point is the introduction of the 'Greater David' (Jesus), which provides the 'resolution' to the tension established in the first half. However, the structure is quite symmetrical and 'three-point' in its sub-sections, which can feel slightly static compared to a more fluid narrative arc. The energy remains high because the 'stakes' (death, meaninglessness) are kept in view.",
      "quotes": [
        "What the psalm is going to help us understand is why we need a refuge that cannot be shaken and how we can get a refuge that cannot be shaken.",
        "You see why David is crying out. We all cry out. We don’t want to just be a wave upon the sand.",
        "What evidence would you need today to overwhelm your skepticism...?"

      "strengths": [
        "Strong 'upsetting' of the hearer's sense of security at the beginning.",
        "Clear progression from existential need to theological solution.",
        "The conclusion ties the 'Easter' context back to the 'Psalm' text effectively."

        "The transition between the three 'How' points feels a bit like a classroom lecture; more organic transitions would improve the 'flow'.",
        "The 'turning point' could be more dramatic—the shift to Christ feels slightly like a logical necessity rather than a surprising 'event'.",
        "Allow the 'tension' of the first half to linger longer into the second half to avoid a 'cheap' resolution."

      "plot_diagnosis": "A hybrid of a static three-point structure and a dynamic journey; the logic provides the movement."

    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a masterclass in 'Reframing' (Cilliers). Keller takes the ancient text of Psalm 16 and frames it within the contemporary 'New York' context of physics, fashion, and intellectual skepticism. He respects the 'strangeness' of the text (the libations of blood, the 'portion') but makes it immediate. The synthesis of the 'beatific vision' with C.S. Lewis’s 'creative rapture' is a creative 'between-space' (inter-esse) that allows the hearer to see reality through a new lens. The sermon doesn't just confirm what the hearer thinks; it challenges the 'foundations' of their secular world-view.",
      "quotes": [
        "A hundred fifty years ago, physicists would have told you that the world was solid... Today, what physicists will tell you is that matter itself is nothing but energy in motion.",
        "There are things that right now you believe as an enlightened person that two generations from now will be risible, embarrassing.",
        "Jews did not believe that there could be a resurrection in the middle of history... yet thousands of Jews started believing."

      "strengths": [
        "Brilliant 'reframing' of ancient idolatry as modern 'panting' after career and beauty.",
        "Organic connection between the 'second law of thermodynamics' and the biblical 'decay'.",
        "The use of Peter’s Pentecost sermon as a 'frame' for the Easter message is historically and textually astute."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The context is very 'intellectual/urban'; it could benefit from more 'earthy' or 'common' context to be more polyvalent.",
        "The 'reframing' relies heavily on Western intellectual history; more global or diverse contextual markers could be used.",
        "The transition from 'physics' to 'resurrection' is a large leap that could be bridged with more 'human-scale' integration."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing; the sermon offers a completely new lens (resurrection) to view the 'shakable' reality of the hearer."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "As an 'Open Work of Art' (Stark), the sermon is a mixed bag. It is 'open' in that it invites the skeptic into the conversation and acknowledges the difficulty of belief ('What evidence would you need?'). It respects the 'ambivalence of existence' (decay, loss). However, the apologetic drive makes it somewhat 'closed.' The logic is so tight that it can feel 'coercive' rather than 'invitational.' It moves toward a 'happy ending' (the resurrection as fact) that might not leave enough room for the 'not yet' or the 'mystery' that Cilliers advocates. It is more 'monovalent' in its drive toward a specific conclusion than 'polyvalent.'",
      "quotes": [
        "If you do not believe that Jesus Christ was physically raised from the dead... would you please imagine what would happen if you did?",
        "Is there any reason to believe in the resurrection? Lots of it.",
        "Run to the doctrine of the resurrection. Run to it, and you will receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The use of 'imagine if you did believe' is a brilliant 'open' rhetorical move.",
        "Acknowledges the 'oceans of dead time,' taking the pain of existence seriously.",
        "Treats the hearer as a conversation partner rather than a target."

        "End with a more 'open' question or invitation to wonder rather than a directive to 'run to the doctrine'.",
        "Leave more room for the 'mystery' of the resurrection rather than treating it primarily as a 'historical fact' to be proven.",
        "Allow for 'resistance' (Stark) within the text—acknowledge that even with evidence, belief is a 'space for grace' (Cilliers)."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Leans toward a 'closed' apologetic system, though it uses 'open' rhetorical questions to engage the hearer."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7,
    "summary_structure": "The structure is a robust 'dramaturgy of logic.' It moves effectively from the 'trouble' of a shaking world to the 'grace' of an unshakable kingdom. The integration of text and context is the sermon's greatest structural strength, providing a powerful 'reframing' of modern life. While it risks being 'closed' by its own logical rigor, it maintains an 'open' posture toward the skeptic, creating a space where the 'holy happens' through the intellectual and emotional confrontation with the resurrection."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It avoids 'pre-chewed emotions' and 'cheap comfort.' By starting with the 'second law of thermodynamics' and the 'decay' of the human body, Keller refuses to offer a 'happy ending' without first looking into the abyss of 'dead time.' The emotion is authentic because it is grounded in the real pain of loss (the aging model, the scattering of friends). It avoids the 'clichéd story' by using rigorous intellectual categories. It is 'sober' in the best Reformed sense, drawing attention to the 'object' (the Resurrection) rather than the 'sentiment' of the preacher.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "None identified; the sermon actively deconstructs kitsch by challenging 'enlightened' views that will become 'risible'.",
      "Avoids the 'Jesus is the light' cliché by grounding joy in the 'creative rapture' of God."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the model realizing her beauty is fading—a poignant, non-sentimental look at human precariousness.",
      "The acknowledgement of 'oceans of dead time'—a stark, honest assessment of a godless universe."
    ],
    "recommendation": "Maintain this level of 'aesthetic honesty' by continuing to engage with the 'shadow side' of existence before proclaiming the light."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace primarily through the 'reframing' of reality. By showing that the 'solid' world is actually 'precarious,' Keller creates a 'space' where the 'Holy' (the unshakable kingdom) can be perceived. He sustains the tension between the 'already' of the resurrection and the 'not yet' of our current decay. However, the 'space' is slightly narrowed by the apologetic 'proof' approach, which can make grace feel like a logical conclusion rather than a 'gift' (Cilliers). The 'mystery' of God's presence is respected through the Lewis quote, but then 'explained' through the historical evidence for the resurrection.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained well in the first half but resolved perhaps too 'rationally' in the second.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'beatific vision' is treated with appropriate wonder, but the resurrection is treated as a 'fact' to be mastered.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails over moralization; the sermon is about 'receiving' a kingdom, not 'building' one.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'mystery' of the resurrection to remain a bit more 'unavailable' to human logic to emphasize its character as 'pure grace'."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon represents a high-quality 'apologetic-aesthetic' style. Its primary strength lies in its 'stewardship of language' and its ability to 'reframe' the biblical text for a contemporary, skeptical audience. It avoids religious kitsch with surgical precision, offering instead a 'sober beauty' that respects the hearer's intellect. The imagery, while often borrowed, is effectively used to 'show' the precariousness of life and the 'rapture' of God's presence. The dramaturgy is driven by a logical 'plot' that moves from existential 'trouble' to the 'grace' of the resurrection. While it leans toward a 'closed' structure due to its apologetic goals, it creates a significant 'space for grace' by deconstructing the false foundations of the secular world. It is a model of how to use 'intellectual aesthetics' to serve the proclamation of the Gospel.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Exceptional 'Reframing' of ancient text into modern existential and scientific categories.",
      "Complete absence of religious kitsch; high level of aesthetic and intellectual honesty.",
      "Precise stewardship of language that translates theological concepts into accessible, vivid imagery."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase the 'musicality' and poetic rhythm of the prose to balance the logical rigor.",
      "Allow for more 'openness' and 'mystery' in the conclusion to avoid a coercive apologetic tone.",
      "Incorporate more primary biblical 'painting' to complement the secondary cultural analogies."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Intellectual-Apologetic (Sober-Reformed)",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Timothy Keller's own 'Redeemer' style, which aligns with Paul Scott Wilson's 'Four Pages' (Trouble/Grace) and Johan Cilliers' 'Reframing'.",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals most to urban, educated, skeptical, or 'post-Christian' hearers who value intellectual integrity and clarity.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'narrative' structure that relies less on three-point sub-logic.",
      "Use more 'silence' or 'open endings' in the text to allow the 'Space for Grace' to expand.",
      "Incorporate more sensory language related to the 'liturgical moment' of the service itself."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically strong 'event' that succeeds in 'reframing' the hearer's perception of reality. By eschewing kitsch and jargon, it achieves a 'transparency toward God' that is the hallmark of Reformed aesthetics. It is a 'work of art' in its logical construction and its careful 'stewardship of the word,' even if it occasionally sacrifices poetic 'openness' for apologetic 'clarity.' It effectively creates a 'space for grace' by making the 'unshakable kingdom' a plausible and desirable reality for the modern mind."
