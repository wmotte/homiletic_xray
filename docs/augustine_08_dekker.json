  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's primary formal requirement. It does not expound a specific pericope but functions as a thematic 'speech about the gospel' or 'Easter'. It strings together disparate biblical keywords and verses as proof-texts for a general mood of celebration rather than actualizing one specific text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Hence, we all cry out, 'This is the day the Lord has made!'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one specific pericope (e.g., the account of the Good Thief or a specific Resurrection narrative) and identify what that text says that can be found nowhere else, rather than using the Bible as a general reservoir of motifs."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 1,
      "findings": "There is no evidence of historical-critical exegesis or engagement with the original Hebrew/Greek context. The text is treated as a flat, timeless allegory. The meaning for the 'first readers' is entirely ignored in favor of immediate liturgical application.",
      "quotes": [
        "A mystical veil had wrapped the Old Law, but was torn as 'the night ended and day was dawning.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Incorporate the historical and theological context of the chosen biblical book. Explain what the 'day' meant in the context of the Psalmist or the 'veil' in the context of the Jerusalem temple."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The application is largely general and abstract. While it mentions 'calumny' and 'clothing,' these are not developed into a concrete analysis of the contemporary zeitgeist or the specific spiritual life of the congregation. It remains in the realm of 'general truths' which Dekker forbids.",
      "quotes": [
        "However plain his clothing, all that matters is that he should shine forth due to his qualities of mind and heart."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Move beyond liturgical joy to address how the Resurrection specifically confronts the modern 'lostness in time' or specific societal/personal anxieties of the current year."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Because there is no real exposition, there is nothing to interweave. The sermon is a continuous stream of application-oriented rhetoric. The hearer is not 'drawn into the text' because the text's own internal logic is never explored.",
      "quotes": [
        "And so it is with us. After our dark night of struggling, gladsome light radiates upon us..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Structure the sermon so that the discovery of the text's meaning (exposition) is simultaneously the discovery of the hearer's reality (application)."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The three parts are present in the background. Misery is identified as 'chains of sin' and 'dark night,' redemption is the work of Christ, and gratitude is the 'hymn of bliss.' However, the 'misery' feels somewhat aestheticized rather than a deep psychological or spiritual reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "Today, the chains of hell have burst asunder. May the chains of each and every sin do likewise."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the 'misery' section. Make the 'chains of sin' concrete to the human subject so that the 'redemption' is not just a liturgical fact but a necessary rescue."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon hints at the two ways by mentioning 'whoever perseveres' and the 'accuser' losing his case. However, the seriousness of being lost is overshadowed by a triumphalist tone. The 'ultimate possibilities of life design' are not sharply presented.",
      "quotes": [
        "Whoever perseveres in loving God his whole life long will merit the grace of delighting eternally in this day."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the possibility of 'being lost in time'—the failure to answer God's calling—to give the Easter joy its proper weight and urgency."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos and the source of grace. The sermon maintains that salvation is outside of man ('merited salvation for us'). The doctrine of the two natures is implicit in the description of his suffering and divinity.",
      "quotes": [
        "Because of our Redeemer’s innocence, he merited salvation for us."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure Christ is not just a figure in a cosmic drama but the specific Word speaking through the chosen pericope."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "At approximately 850 words, the sermon lasts about 8-9 minutes. This is significantly below Dekker's 20-minute minimum. It lacks the 'breadth' required for 'depth.'",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the sermon to at least 2000 words to allow for thorough exposition and concrete application."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The text falls short of being a 'sermon' according to Dekker's formal definition. It lacks a specific Bible passage as its foundation, opting instead for a thematic collage of verses. It entirely omits historical-critical exegesis and fails the length requirement for depth. While substantively Christocentric and aware of the three parts (misery, redemption, gratitude), it remains too abstract and liturgical to achieve the concrete application Dekker demands.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong Christocentric focus where Christ is the clear telos of the message.",
      "Clear movement from the misery of sin to the gratitude of the resurrection.",
      "Effective use of liturgical language to evoke a sense of the 'present' of revelation."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of a specific pericope; the sermon is a topical speech rather than an exposition.",
      "Absence of scholarly exegesis (Hebrew/Greek/Context).",
      "Insufficient length (8.5 minutes) to achieve theological or psychological depth.",
      "Application is too general and lacks engagement with the contemporary zeitgeist."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is a homiletical meditation or a liturgical exhortation. To become a sermon, it must be anchored in the exposition of a single, specific text and expanded significantly in both breadth and concrete application."
