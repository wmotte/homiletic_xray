    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and promotes autonomy. It successfully deconstructs the 'Critical Parent' tradition of the Eucharist (guilt/fear) and replaces it with an 'Adult' analysis of social reality and a 'Free Child' celebration of community. By admitting their own 'heaviness' and loneliness, the preachers avoid the 'Rescuer' trap and establish an authentic, horizontal relationship with the listeners.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to share the 'how-to' struggles of implementing these visions to prevent the vision itself from becoming a new 'Critical Parent' demand."
