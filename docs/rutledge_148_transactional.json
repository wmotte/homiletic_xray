  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Bait and Switch' homiletics. It utilizes a strong Critical Parent to induce 'holy dread' and 'terror' in the listener (Adapted Child), only to switch to a Nurturing Parent who offers 'comfort' and 'grace'. While theologically traditional, it creates a dependency loop where the listener must feel psychologically crushed to experience the divine. The metaphor of the sleeping addict receiving money is particularly disempowering, as it removes all Adult agency from the listener.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of narrative and metaphor to engage the Child ego state.",
      "Clear, consistent internal logic."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on shaming language ('puffed up', 'miserable condition').",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult invitation for the listener to take responsibility for their spiritual growth."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as Adult subjects capable of choosing grace, rather than Victims who must be terrified into it. Reduce the 'Persecutor' list of sins and instead invite 'Adult' reflection on how grace functions in the 'here-and-now' without requiring a 'terror' prerequisite."
