While it avoids harsh Critical Parent dynamics, it risks keeping the listener in a 'Victim' role within the Drama Triangle by over-emphasizing fragility and the need for external 'refreshment.' The closing quote by John Donne reinforces a 'blessed dependency' that is the antithesis of TA's goal of Adult autonomy.",

    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Invite the congregation to use their Adult ego state to determine *how* they will practice 'refreshment' rather than prescribing 'dependency.' Replace the closing quote of 'sucking at wounds' with a call to Adult agency and Christian maturity."
