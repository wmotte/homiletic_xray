    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and remarkably free of the 'games' common in homiletics. It uses TA principles—perhaps intuitively—to deconstruct the Critical Parent (Pharaoh/Coercion) and the Adapted Child (Denial/Silence). By validating the 'weary' Adult and inviting the 'Free Child' to dance and trust, the preacher promotes genuine autonomy and 'congruity.' The transition from a diagnostic Adult tone to a celebratory Free Child tone provides a healthy emotional arc without resorting to guilt or manipulation.",

      "The 'Adult' section on 'truth-telling' could be more concrete regarding how to handle the consequences of such truth in a 'Pharaonic' system."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' language to maintain Adult-Adult parity. Ensure the final 'invitation to dance' remains an invitation and does not become a new 'Free Child quota' that listeners feel they must perform."
