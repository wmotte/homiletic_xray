May he confirm this truth in your hearts, today and for ever. Amen."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon stays close to the narrative of the Wedding at Cana. However, it struggles to identify what is unique to THIS text compared to other miracles. The focus on 'running out of wine' as a metaphor for human regret is strong, but the sermon eventually drifts into general Christological titles found elsewhere in John.",
      "quotes": [
        "In today’s reading from John’s Gospel, we discover Jesus at a wedding where the wine has run out.",
        "He is the 'bread of life,' the 'light of the world,' the 'true vine'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Identify the specific 'point' of Cana that exists nowhere else—perhaps the specific intersection of the 'failed' purification rites and the 'hour' of Jesus—rather than listing general Johannine titles."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The preacher demonstrates adequate knowledge of the historical context, specifically the nature of Palestinian weddings and the function of the stone jars for purification. The distinction between 'mother' and 'woman' is handled with theological sobriety.",
      "quotes": [
        "A wedding party in small-town Palestine would have been, hands down, the event of the year...",
        "They were there for the Jewish rite of purification... Water from them is used for the washing away of sin. It is used, but it doesn’t work."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exegesis of the 'hour' (v. 4) beyond mere independence from his mother; connect it more sharply to the cross as the ultimate 'exposition' of this sign."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 8,
      "findings": "This is a strong point. The use of the personal ad from 'The New York Review of Books' provides a concrete, non-general entry into the human condition of the 'zeitgeist'. It avoids 'general truths' by naming specific modern escapes (pills, sexual adventure, Mount Everest).",
      "quotes": [
        "Married man of means and mien looks for a woman who feels that there should have been more to it all.",
        "we buy something and charge it, we drink, we pop a pill, we grab for sexual adventure..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application doesn't remain purely psychological; connect the 'means and mien' more directly to the 'purification jars' of modern secular morality."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a somewhat traditional 'sandwich' structure: modern anecdote, then biblical exposition, then back to modern application. The hearer is not always 'drawn into the text' as it happens, but rather moves between two worlds.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now back to the story.",
        "Now let’s focus for a moment on the wedding party itself."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Avoid phrases like 'Now back to the story' or 'In today's reading'. Try to let the modern 'regret' be explained BY the biblical 'lack of wine' simultaneously."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The 'misery' (regret, the wine running out) is well-developed. The 'redemption' is clearly outside the self (Christ's gift). 'Gratitude' is present but slightly less developed, appearing mostly in the concluding call to service.",
      "quotes": [
        "He sees us, he loves us, and he has come to pour out his life for us.",
        "a life of service to others and to God’s suffering world..."
      ],

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on 'being lost in time' (the emptiness of the secular life), but the 'narrow way' and the 'broad way' leading to destruction are softened. The seriousness of the choice is present but lacks the 'sharpness' Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "...ending in emptiness...",
        "He is the One, the only One who is able to give purification..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Explicitly address the consequence of remaining with the 'empty jars' of purification/secularism versus the 'new wine' of Christ."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "Christ is clearly the telos. The sermon moves from human regret to the 'abundance' of Christ. The doctrine of the two natures is implicit in the discussion of Jesus' authority over his mother and the divine nature of the sign.",
      "quotes": [
        "The wine so freely given represents Jesus’ gift of himself.",
        "the Son of God is powerful to save."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'good wine' more strictly to the 'grace' of the cross to avoid a purely 'miraculous' or 'metaphysical' Christology."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "At approximately 1850 words, the sermon likely clocks in just under the 20-minute threshold (at 100 words/min). According to Dekker, it risks lacking the 'breadth' required for true 'depth'.",
      "improvement_point": "Expand the theological reflection on the 'purification jars' to reach the 20-minute mark, providing more 'breadth' to the transition from law/ritual to grace."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon is a strong attempt at actualizing a biblical text, particularly successful in its contemporary application and psychological 'theft' (reclaiming regret for the pulpit). However, it falls short of Dekker's 20-minute rule and relies on a somewhat segmented structure that separates exposition from application. The 'two ways' are present but lack the necessary sharpness regarding the possibility of being lost.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete application: The use of the personal ad is a traceable, effective example of understanding the zeitgeist.",
      "Theological sobriety: The treatment of Mary and the purification jars is adequate and avoids sentimentalism."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Structural separation: The movement between 'the story' and 'our lives' is too mechanical.",
      "Length: Does not meet the 20-minute requirement for 'depth through breadth'.",
      "Specificity: The conclusion drifts into general Johannine 'I am' statements rather than sticking to the unique 'point' of the Cana sign."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an adequate sermon that approaches Dekker's ideal through its concrete application and Christocentric focus, but it requires more 'breadth' and a more seamless 'interwoven' structure to truly function as the Word of God in the sense of Dekker's theses."
