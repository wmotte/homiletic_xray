  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically healthy and supportive. It avoids the common 'Critical Parent' traps of religious discourse. By focusing on the 'Heden' (Today/Now), it encourages a present-moment awareness (Adult) rather than a guilt-driven past or a fear-driven future. The preacher's tone is consistently nurturing, which fosters a safe environment for the 'Free Child' to experience joy and wonder.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong rejection of coercive 'Critical Parent' theology.",
      "Effective use of 'Free Child' wonder regarding the person of Jesus.",
      "Maintains a consistent, non-manipulative 'Nurturing Parent' stance."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The 'Adult' ego state could be strengthened by asking more reflective questions that require the listener to think, rather than just feel.",
      "Slight risk of creating 'Child' dependency on the preacher's emotional reassurance."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To move toward a 10/10, try to transition from 'I am telling you that you are safe' (NP -> Child) to 'What does it mean for your daily choices that this freedom is now a reality?' (Adult -> Adult)."
