    "risk_explanation": "The only slight risk is the 'Nurturing Parent' invitation to 'wrap oneself in a mantle,' which could theoretically encourage regression, but it is framed as a conscious Adult choice for survival."

  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and highly authentic. It operates almost entirely from an Adult ego state, inviting the listener into a mature, reflective process. By deconstructing the 'Critical Parent' image of God (the angry judge) and replacing it with a 'Free Child/Adult' image of a God of solidarity, the preacher fosters psychological autonomy. The use of Simone Weil provides a concrete reality-test for the abstract theological concept of sacrifice, preventing the 'Ain't It Awful' game by moving toward active solidarity.",

      "High level of transparency regarding personal doubt.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The metaphor of the 'warm mantle' could be expanded to ensure it doesn't lead to passive dependency.",
      "Slightly more 'Free Child' joy could balance the heavy (though necessary) Karfreitag themes."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'I-statements' regarding faith and doubt. Maintain the distinction between 'stuttering' (authentic Child) and 'dogmatizing' (Critical Parent)."
