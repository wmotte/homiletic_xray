    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively employs sensory imagery to bridge the gap between the biblical narrative and the hearer's reality. The preacher moves beyond abstract theological definitions of 'sin' by using visceral metaphors such as 'crawling evils,' 'poisoned wells,' and 'polluted flowers.' There is a strong 'optics' at play, particularly in the description of Bartimaeus's cry as 'strident' and 'piercing.' The preacher follows Paul Scott Wilson’s 'show, don't tell' by describing the physical appearance of temptation as 'smiling and hiding the horrors of death.' However, some images lean toward the conventional (e.g., 'wolf in sheep's clothing'), which prevents a higher score. The most potent imagery is found in the description of the human condition as containing 'foul breath and corrupt discharges,' which forces a raw, sensory confrontation with the concept of depravity.",
      "quotes": [
        "It is so strident, so insistent, so piercing, so loud in volume and intense in tone that it offends the great majority.",
        "When the wolf comes in sheep's clothing and the Prince of Darkness, Satan, masquerades as an angel of light.",

    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The language is deliberate and exhibits a high degree of 'stewardship' as defined by McEntyre. The preacher avoids dense academic jargon, opting for a 'Canaanite' vocabulary that is nonetheless accessible and emotionally charged. There is a clear precision in the distinction between 'physical sight' and 'spiritual vision.' However, the sermon occasionally lapses into generalizations ('all manner of disease') and repetitive rhetorical flourishes that, while effective for oral delivery, lose some precision in written form. The use of the Robert Burns poem and the hymn lyrics shows a curated approach to intertextuality, though the transition into the critique of 'ladies in jeans' feels slightly less precise and more like a colloquial aside compared to the theological rigor of the rest of the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "This indecorum, this coarseness, this rowdyism, this ill-mannered loudness on the part of Bartimaeus.",
        "Some of us think we are witty when we are only nasty, correct when we are only corrupt, brilliant when we are only vulgar.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest aesthetic strength. The text is clearly designed for the ear, utilizing the 'musicality' emphasized by Immink. There is a rhythmic cadence achieved through parallelism and repetition ('It ain't my brother... it's me'). The preacher uses staccato sentences to build tension ('Entering or leaving. What difference?') and longer, flowing sentences for theological reflection. The repetition of 'Lord, that I might receive my sight' acts as a rhythmic refrain. The use of alliteration ('pleading... prayer,' 'Savior's heeding... splendid clinching') creates a melodic quality that aids memorability. The sermon avoids 'paper language' entirely, maintaining a pulse that suggests a dynamic, performative delivery.",
      "quotes": [
        "This pleading and the Savior's heeding formed a splendid clinching, climactic account.",
        "It ain't my brother and it ain't my sister, but it's me, O Lord, standing in the need of prayer.",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The sermon exhibits a high level of micro-aesthetic quality, particularly in its musicality and rhythmic structure. The preacher uses language as a sensory instrument, favoring 'showing' over 'telling.' While the imagery is occasionally traditional, it is deployed with such rhythmic force that it regains its vitality. The stewardship of language is evident in the careful choice of contrasting terms, though the precision is occasionally sacrificed for rhetorical effect. Overall, the language is evocative, oral-centric, and deeply rooted in a tradition that values the sound and 'feel' of the Word as much as its propositional content."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry) by starting with the 'upsetting' encounter of Bartimaeus and moving toward the 'turning point' of the spiritual application. The preacher creates a sense of urgency by noting that 'Jesus is moving very near to Calvary' and 'would never be in Jericho again.' This 'last chance' motif provides a necessary arc of tension. However, the transition from the biblical narrative to the contemporary application (spiritual vision) is somewhat abrupt. The structure feels slightly like a 'two-part' sermon: first the story, then the spiritualization. While there is movement, it lacks the seamless 'cinematic' flow of a true narrative arc, occasionally pausing for didactic explanations of the Synoptic differences.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus would never be in Jericho again. Bartimaeus may have suspected this and cried the louder.",
        "Jesus stopped and asked, 'What wilt thou that I should do unto thee?'",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels at 'reframing' (Cilliers). It takes the 'frame' of a physical healing and places it over the 'context' of the hearer's spiritual blindness. The preacher successfully connects the 'indecorum' of Bartimaeus with the 'respectability' of the modern congregation, challenging the hearer to see their own 'alarming case.' The integration of the 'old spiritual' and the 'Robert Burns poem' serves as a bridge between the ancient text and the cultural context of the hearer. The 'reframing' is most powerful when the preacher suggests that the congregation is currently in their 'last Jericho.' This collapses the distance between 'then' and 'now,' making the biblical event a present reality.",
      "quotes": [
        "Whenever a congregation comes together, it is likely the last time that that same group of worshipers will ever come together.",
        "As Bartimaeus prayed for physical sight, so we need to pray for spiritual vision to see ourselves.",
        "The Lord is passing through our Jericho on his way to the New Jerusalem."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Successful 'reframing' of physical blindness as spiritual self-deception.",
        "Strong 'inter-esse' (moving between the text and the contemporary human condition).",
        "Effective use of cultural artifacts (poetry, spirituals) to ground the text."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection to 'western heels' and 'jeans' feels a bit dated and less 'universal' than the rest of the reframing.",
        "Could explore the 'social' dimension of blindness/vision to deepen the context.",
        "The 'reframing' of Satan as an 'angel of light' could be more concretely applied to modern ethical dilemmas."

    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "In terms of Stark's 'open work of art,' the sermon is relatively 'closed.' It follows a traditional homiletic trajectory where the problem is identified (blindness/sin) and the solution is definitively provided (Jesus). While it acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' (mixed motives, tainted loves), it resolves these tensions quickly through the 'O Lamb of God, I come' refrain. The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long) but also as a 'teacher' who explains exactly what the hearer should see. There is little room for the hearer to interpret 'vision' for themselves; the preacher defines it as seeing one's own loathsomeness and then seeing Jesus. The ending is an invitation, which offers some openness, but the theological 'schema' is quite coercive.",
      "quotes": [
        "When I see myself, I look at something loathsome and imperfect.",
        "Never mind, preacher, your silver-tongued eloquence... I must see Jesus.",
        "He will stop and give spiritual sight to each of us."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The invitation at the end provides a space for the hearer to respond.",
        "Honest acknowledgment of the 'mixed motives' of the human heart.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "Allow more space for the 'mystery' of how vision is received rather than prescribing a specific emotional path.",
        "End with a more evocative image or question rather than a definitive 'He will stop' statement.",
        "Acknowledge that 'spiritual vision' might look different for different people in the congregation."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Primarily a closed work; it functions as a 'monovalent' proclamation of a specific theological solution."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is functional and driven by a clear narrative arc, though it occasionally feels segmented. The sermon's greatest structural success is its ability to 'reframe' the biblical narrative into a present-tense urgency, collapsing the historical distance. However, it remains a largely 'closed' work of art, where the preacher maintains tight control over the interpretation and resolution. The movement from 'trouble' to 'grace' is structurally sound but perhaps too predictable, following a well-trodden path that leaves little room for the 'ambivalence' Cilliers advocates for."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon largely avoids religious kitsch by refusing to offer 'immediate comfort without taking the pain of suffering seriously.' The preacher’s description of the human condition as 'loathsome,' 'spiritually sick,' and containing 'corrupt discharges' is the antithesis of kitsch; it is a gritty, un-beautified look at sin. However, there are moments where the sermon flirts with sentimentality, particularly in the use of the 'Just as I am' hymn as a recurring emotional trigger. While these are 'authentic' within the tradition, they risk becoming 'pre-chewed emotions' if not grounded in the earlier 'trouble.' The 'anti-kitsch' strength lies in the refusal to give Bartimaeus a 'happy ending' without first emphasizing the 'vulgarity' and 'desperation' of his cry.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The slightly sentimental reference to 'dearest people here who have walked so gallantly into the darkness.'",
      "The somewhat clichéd 'wolf in sheep's clothing' imagery."
    ],
    "authentic_moments": [
      "The raw description of the body's 'foul breath and corrupt discharges' as a metaphor for the soul.",
      "The honest admission that 'our noblest loves are so tainted with selfishness.'"
    ],
    "recommendation": "To further avoid kitsch, the preacher could lean more into the 'silence' and 'darkness' mentioned early on, rather than resolving every tension with a familiar hymn lyric."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 6,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens a 'space for grace' by emphasizing the unavailability of the Savior ('Jesus would never be in Jericho again') and the total helplessness of the petitioner ('I do not have fruits'). By stripping away the 'silver-tongued eloquence' and 'scholarship' of the preacher, it creates a vacuum that only 'Jesus' can fill. However, the space is somewhat 'closed' by the heavy moralizing tone regarding self-perception (the 'western heels' and 'jeans' section). True 'space for grace' requires a certain degree of mystery, which is occasionally crowded out by the preacher's desire to explain and categorize every spiritual state.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions are sustained well in the first half (the 'vulgar' cry vs. 'respectability'), but resolved perhaps too quickly in the second half.",
    "mystery_respected": "The mystery of God's presence is acknowledged ('angels keep watching over you'), but the 'mechanics' of salvation are presented quite definitively.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails in the 'Just as I am' sections, but moralization intrudes in the 'seeing ourselves' section.",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'mystery' of the blind man's encounter to linger longer before moving into the 'application' of what we must see."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 6.5,
    "summary": "The sermon is an aesthetically robust example of the 'New Homiletic' influenced by the African American tradition. Its primary strength lies in its 'Poetics of Language'—specifically its rhythm, musicality, and visceral imagery. The preacher successfully 'reframes' the story of Bartimaeus, moving it from a historical miracle to a contemporary 'kairos' moment of spiritual crisis. The use of sensory language ('strident,' 'piercing,' 'loathsome') prevents the sermon from becoming a dry theological treatise. However, the sermon is aesthetically limited by its 'closed' structure. It leaves little room for the hearer's own interpretive journey, instead guiding them through a pre-determined emotional and theological sequence. The 'dramaturgy' is effective but follows a traditional 'trouble-to-grace' schema that can feel predictable. While it avoids the 'kitsch' of easy optimism by dwelling on the 'ugliness' of sin, it occasionally relies on sentimental liturgical triggers (hymns) to achieve its emotional effects. Overall, it is a powerful, performative work that prioritizes the 'event' of the sermon over the 'document' of the text.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Rhythmic and musical language that creates a powerful oral 'flow.'",
      "Visceral, non-kitsch imagery used to describe the human condition.",
      "Effective 'reframing' of the biblical narrative into a present-tense urgency."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Increase structural 'openness' to allow for more hearer-led interpretation.",
      "Refine contemporary examples to avoid dated or moralistic asides (e.g., the fashion critiques).",
      "Integrate scholarly/didactic elements more seamlessly into the narrative arc."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Narrative-Dramatic with high Musicality (Black Homiletic influence).",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Paul Scott Wilson's 'Four Pages' (strong imagery/trouble-grace balance) and Gerrit Immink's 'Performance' (the sermon as a happening).",
    "audience_analysis": "Hearers who value emotional depth, rhythmic delivery, and a clear, Christocentric resolution will be most appealed to.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with an 'open ending' that leaves the hearer in the 'Jericho road' space.",
      "Use more 'secular' metaphors for spiritual blindness to reach a broader contemporary audience.",
      "Read the text aloud to further refine the 'staccato' vs 'legato' rhythms."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is an aesthetically 'good' (6.5) work that excels in its oral and rhythmic qualities. It avoids the trap of religious kitsch by confronting the 'loathsomeness' of the human condition, thereby creating a genuine need for grace. While its structure is somewhat traditional and 'closed,' its linguistic vitality and successful 'reframing' of the text make it a compelling example of preaching as a performative event. It is a sermon that 'shows' the desperation of the human cry and the singular focus of the 'Savior's heeding,' even if it occasionally over-explains the mystery it seeks to evoke."
