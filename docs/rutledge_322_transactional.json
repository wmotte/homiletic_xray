  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'Theological CP.' While it is homiletically strong and biblically grounded, it functions psychologically by breaking down the listener's Adult ego through guilt and shock. By equating modern secular life (laundry, cards, ads) with the 'Power of Darkness,' it creates a dependency on the liturgical 'Rescue.' The listener is not invited to an Adult-Adult dialogue with the text but is forced into a 'guilty child' role to receive grace.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong use of contemporary Adult data to ground the sermon.",
      "Clear, compelling narrative structure."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on collective guilt (NIGYSOB).",
      "Lack of Free Child (FC) elements; the 'joy' of Easter is buried under the 'horror' of the Passion."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as Adult subjects capable of choosing the 'Christian story' because of its intrinsic beauty, rather than because they are 'implicated' in a cosmic crime. Reduce the 'shock' tactics and allow the Adult to process the 'horrible' imagery without forcing a specific emotional payoff."
