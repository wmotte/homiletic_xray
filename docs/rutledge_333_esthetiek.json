    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon utilizes a mix of traditional biblical imagery and sharp contemporary snapshots. The preacher effectively 'paints' the theological concept of substitution by using the physical metaphor of 'weight' and 'absorption'. However, much of the imagery remains within the realm of 'religious vocabulary' (blood, mercy seat, lamb) without always providing the sensory 'showing' that Paul Scott Wilson advocates for. The strongest imagery appears when the preacher moves away from the pulpit jargon and into the streets of Teaneck or the 'arc of the universe'. The 'stench' or 'physicality' of the cross is largely absent, replaced by a more intellectualized 'hideousness'.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The language is exceptionally precise and demonstrates high stewardship of the word (McEntyre). The preacher carefully navigates the 'repugnant' pitfalls of atonement theories, distinguishing between a 'wrathful Father' and the unified will of the Trinity. There is a clear effort to rescue words like 'satisfaction' from medieval dust and place them into the moral order of the 21st century. The vocabulary is sophisticated yet accessible, avoiding 'Canaanite' jargon by explaining the necessity of the terms used. The distinction between 'legal fiction' and 'moral order' shows a high level of intellectual and linguistic care.",

        "Some preachers and teachers have pictured, in repugnant terms, a wrathful Father piling condemnation on an innocent, victimized Son.",

    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a dignified, liturgical rhythm. It uses repetition effectively ('Somebody has got to pay') as a refrain that anchors the movement. There is a clear 'legato' in the theological reflections and a 'staccato' urgency when discussing contemporary violence. The use of the hymn 'Were you there' adds a musical layer to the text itself. While it occasionally feels like 'paper language' due to its dense theological content, the rhetorical questions and the rhythmic 'cycle of...' passages ensure it remains an oral event. The ending has a strong, crescendo-like cadence.",

    "average_score_language": 7.0,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of this sermon are characterized by a 'sober-Reformed' beauty. It avoids sentimentalism in favor of theological precision. The imagery is effective when grounded in history (Civil Rights) but occasionally remains abstract in its biblical references. The stewardship of language is high; the preacher treats words as instruments of truth, carefully dismantling caricatures of the cross. The rhythm is steady and liturgical, providing a reliable 'arc' for the listener to follow, though it occasionally demands high cognitive load from the hearer."

      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins with the 'equilibrium' of Good Friday motifs, quickly introduces the 'upsetting' problem of the 'tortured syntax' of the cross and the 'hideousness' of sin. The tension is maintained through the human cry for justice ('Somebody has got to pay'). The turning point (peripeteia) is the realization that God Himself pays the price, breaking the cycle of retaliation. The movement from Teaneck to the Cross to the Civil Rights movement creates a dynamic journey. The energy remains high because the 'stakes' are not just theological but involve life-and-death global realities.",

      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a masterclass in 'reframing' (Cilliers). The preacher takes a difficult, often-rejected theological concept (substitutionary atonement) and reframes it through the lens of systemic injustice and the Civil Rights movement. By connecting the 'satisfaction' of Anselm to the 'anguished father' in Teaneck, the preacher makes the ancient text contemporary without 'smoothing' its strangeness. The context of 'suburban congregations' is contrasted with 'communities of color' to challenge the hearer's perception of the Gospel. The text (2 Cor 5:21) is not a springboard but the lens through which the world's violence is interpreted.",

        "Suburban congregations tend to be struggling largely with personal issues... so that we think more in terms of finding support and healing than we do overcoming injustice.",

    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "While the sermon is theologically 'decided' (it has a clear proclamation), it leaves room for the 'ambivalence of existence' by acknowledging that the 'day of truth' is 'a long time coming'. It avoids the 'kitsch' of a happy ending by pointing to the 'tested' nature of faith and the ongoing 'night of wrong'. However, the structure is somewhat 'closed' in its dogmatic certainty regarding the mechanics of atonement. It approaches the hearer as a witness to a finished work, which is powerful, but leaves less room for the hearer's own 'appropriation' or 'resistance' (Stark) than a more polyvalent narrative might.",
      "quotes": [
        "But where, Lord? And how long? Where is that righteousness?",

    },
    "average_score_structure": 7.0,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic quality is strong, driven by a compelling narrative arc that links the 'moral order' of the universe to the specific death of Jesus. The integration of text and context is the sermon's greatest structural strength, successfully 'reframing' substitutionary atonement for a modern audience. While the sermon is dogmatically 'closed' in its proclamation of the finished work of Christ, it maintains aesthetic 'openness' by refusing to offer a cheap, immediate resolution to the world's pain, instead pointing toward a 'down payment' and a future hope."

  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably free of religious kitsch. It explicitly 'strenuously resists' the kitschy, 'repugnant' caricatures of a wrathful Father. It avoids the 'happy ending' cliché by grounding hope in the 'nonviolent struggle' and 'martyred' figures like Romero and King. The emotion is authentic, born of 'anguish' and 'systemic injustice', rather than manufactured sentiment. By refusing to 'smooth' the hideousness of the cross or the reality of the Israel-Palestine conflict, the preacher maintains aesthetic depth. It is a 'sober' look at a 'hideous' reality.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [

  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon creates a significant 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) by moving the focus from human effort to the 'down payment' God has already made. It sustains the tension between the 'already' of the cross and the 'not yet' of the 'night of wrong'. By defining grace not as 'amnesty' (which is cheap) but as 'satisfaction' (which is costly), it opens a space where the Holy can be encountered as both Just and Merciful. It avoids moralization by emphasizing that 'God arranged for his own self to pay', though it ends with a call to 'embody that truth'.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between justice and mercy, and between current violence and future peace, are sustained throughout.",
    "mystery_respected": "The 'mystery of the atoning sacrifice' is explicitly named and protected from over-explanation.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the human response is framed as 'bearing witness' to what God has already done.",
    "recommendation": "To open even more space, the preacher could dwell longer in the 'Cry of Dereliction' to allow the 'Godforsakenness' to be felt before the 'satisfaction' is explained."

    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'Sober-Reformed' homiletics. Its primary strength lies in its intellectual and emotional integrity, refusing to settle for religious kitsch or easy answers to the problem of evil. The preacher demonstrates high stewardship of language, carefully navigating complex theological waters to deliver a message that is both traditionally grounded and contemporary. The 'reframing' of substitutionary atonement through the lens of the Civil Rights movement is an aesthetic and theological triumph, providing a 'new optics' for a difficult doctrine. While the language is occasionally dense and 'paper-like', the rhythmic use of the 'Somebody has got to pay' motif provides a strong oral anchor. The sermon successfully opens a 'space for grace' by insisting on the gravity of sin and the even greater gravity of God's self-offering. It is a work of 'sober beauty' that directs attention away from the preacher's craft and toward the 'event' of the Cross.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Profound 'reframing' of substitutionary atonement through modern social justice contexts.",

      "Read the text aloud during drafting to identify and break up 'paper-heavy' sentences.",
      "Dwell longer in the 'strangeness' of the biblical text before moving to the 'reframing' context."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically strong performance that honors the 'aesthetic turn' by treating form as inseparable from content. It avoids the 'vertical-only' trap of early dialectical theology while also avoiding the 'horizontal-only' trap of mere social commentary. By placing the 'holy happening' of the cross in the 'between' space of human cries for justice and God's definitive answer, it achieves a high degree of homiletic excellence. It is a 'Space for Grace' that respects both the intellect and the heart of the listener."
