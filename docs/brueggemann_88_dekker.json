    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's requirement of focusing on ONE specific passage. It jumps between John 20 (Thomas), Acts 5 (Peter), and Psalm 150 (Doxology). By treating the Bible as a collection of themes ('the empire', 'forgiveness'), it loses the specificity of what can be found 'nowhere else' in a single pericope.",
      "quotes": [
        "The story in Acts offers a second learning.",
        "The faith of the church culminates in praise. It ends, as does the Book of Psalms in Psalm 150..."

      "improvement_point": "Select either the narrative of Acts 5 or the poetry of Psalm 150. Do not use Psalm 150 merely as a thematic 'culmination' of a New Testament narrative."

    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is an attempt to reconstruct the 'Empire' context, but it feels more like a modern sociological construct projected onto the text than a rigorous linguistic or historical exegesis. The mention of 'original patriarchal formulation' shows some awareness of text history, but it is used for ideological rather than expository purposes.",
      "quotes": [
        "In the original patriarchal formulation, 'We must obey God rather than man.'",
        "In the Bible the notion of 'breath' is the same word as 'spirit.'"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exegesis of the specific Greek or Hebrew terms in their immediate literary context rather than using them to support a broad 'Empire vs. Church' binary."

    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding the 'zeitgeist' (consumerism, political power), which Dekker values. However, it often slips into 'general truths' about 'the empire' which can become a vague catch-all for anything the preacher dislikes, rather than concrete spiritual guidance for the specific congregation.",
      "quotes": [
        "We are always deciding whether me-first consumerism is the way to well-being or whether outrageous generosity is a better route to real life."

      "improvement_point": "Move from the general 'Empire' critique to the specific 'misery' of the hearer in their local, personal context as 'expounded' by the text."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The sermon is well-interwoven. The preacher does not separate the 'then' and 'now' into distinct blocks; instead, the Roman Empire and the modern 'status quo' are treated as a single continuous reality. This meets Dekker's demand for a 'new, current, proclamatory word.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Imagine the rat-race to pay taxes and 24/7 work to stay on top of the heap in the empire. Sound familiar? It was like that."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the 'interweaving' doesn't flatten the historical distance so much that the Bible passage loses its own voice to the preacher's social commentary."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The 'misery' is identified as being trapped in the 'Empire of death.' Redemption is the 'breath' of the Spirit. However, the 'misery' feels more political/sociological than the 'misery before God' that Dekker/Heidelberg Catechism requires. It lacks the depth of personal sin/guilt, focusing instead on external 'systems.'",
      "quotes": [
        "The story exhibits the contradiction between the empire of death and the Living One..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the 'misery' of the human subject as a 'willing and responsible being' before God, not just as a victim of an imperial system."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon explicitly mentions the 'life-or-death decision' and the 'two ways' (obeying God vs human authority). It takes the hearer seriously as a choosing being. However, it avoids the 'eternal loss' aspect Dekker mentions, focusing almost exclusively on 'temporal loss' (being lost in the empire).",
      "quotes": [
        "It was, and is, clearly a life-or-death decision that we are always making about the truth of Easter."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos as the 'Living One.' The scars are emphasized, which grounds the sermon in the 'two natures' (the suffering human and the risen Lord). However, grace is often framed as 'power for civil disobedience' rather than the 'salvation outside himself' that detaches man from himself.",
      "quotes": [
        "The surging power of the Easter church is not throttled by the stifling of the empire.",
        "We are on the receiving end from him of his offer of life..."

    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "At approximately 1150 words, the sermon would last about 11-12 minutes. According to Dekker's Thesis 8, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for 'depth.' It is too brief to properly expound three different biblical passages and their applications.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Increase the length to at least 20 minutes (approx. 2000 words) by slowing down the exegesis of a single passage."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon functions more as a thematic address on 'Empire vs. Resurrection' than a strict exposition of a Bible passage. It fails the formal definition by mixing too many texts and falling significantly short of the 20-minute threshold. While it captures the 'seriousness of choice' and 'contemporary application' Dekker desires, it lacks the specific exegetical depth and the 'misery before God' (as opposed to misery before the state) that characterizes Dekker's homiletic ideal.",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong contemporary relevance and awareness of the 'zeitgeist'.",
      "Effective interwoveness of biblical narrative and modern life.",
      "Clear call to responsibility and decision-making (the two ways)."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (11-12 minutes) prevents theological depth.",
      "Lack of focus on a single, specific Bible passage.",
      "Theological 'misery' is reduced to sociological 'oppression' by the 'Empire'."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is an engaging speech about 'the gospel' and 'the empire,' but according to Dekker's strict criteria (Theses 1.3 and 8), it is not yet a sermon. It lacks the necessary breadth and the focus on the unique contribution of a single pericope."
