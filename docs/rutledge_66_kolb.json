    "phase_1_concrete_experience": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon effectively utilizes concrete experiences through personal anecdotes and cultural references. The preacher connects the erotic energy of youth ministry with the biblical text, making the 'feeling' of the Song of Songs tangible. However, it lacks a singular, immersive 'slice of life' that allows the hearer to inhabit a specific character's perspective within the biblical narrative itself, relying more on external memories.",

    "phase_2_reflective_observation": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon pauses to reflect on the 'why' of the human condition, specifically the tension between erotic desire and spiritual longing. It explores the problem of cultural 'transgression' versus 'insight.' While it identifies the problem of modern promiscuity, the analysis of *why* our culture seeks the 'forbidden' remains somewhat brief and could benefit from deeper psychological or sociological exploration beyond the quote from Proverbs.",
      "quotes": [
        "Wisdom asks the question, 'What does it mean to live wisely before God?'",

The preacher provides a sophisticated theological framework, integrating historical exegesis (Bede), the Trinity, the Imago Dei, and the concept of 'ecstasy' as standing outside oneself.

      "analysis": "The sermon is weakest in providing specific, concrete action steps. While it calls for 'courage' and 'faithfulness,' and addresses parents/counselors, it remains largely at the level of ethical ideals rather than practical implementation. The 'how' of sustaining a 50-year marriage or resisting culture is implied through 'grace' and 'memory' but lacks a step-by-step pragmatic guide.",

    "summary": "The sermon is a high-level theological reflection that successfully integrates historical exegesis with contemporary cultural concerns. It falls short in the 'Active Experimentation' phase, offering few concrete, actionable steps for the congregation to implement the theological insights provided. It works exceptionally well as a 'Declarative' and 'Visionary' piece, using the Venerable Bede and George Herbert to elevate the hearer's understanding of eros. The use of personal narrative (the youth ministry anecdote) provides a necessary 'Concrete Experience' that prevents the sermon from becoming purely academic. However, the transition between the high-level Trinitarian theology and the practical advice for parents feels somewhat abrupt. The sermon addresses the 'Assimilating' learner most effectively, providing a rich intellectual feast, but leaves the 'Converging' learner wanting more practical utility.",

      "Begin with a Concrete Experience from the biblical text itself to draw the hearer into the narrative world immediately.",
      "Dedicate the final third of the sermon to 'Active Experimentation' with specific, tiered applications for different life stages.",
      "Incorporate a 'Reflective Observation' moment that asks the congregation to internalize a specific question before providing the theological answer."
    ],
    "conclusion": "This sermon is a strong example of theological homiletics, particularly suited for a pastors' conference. It excels in the 'Normative' and 'Abstract' tasks, providing a robust defense of a spiritual reading of the Song of Songs. From a Kolb perspective, it is a 'Thinking-heavy' sermon that prioritizes conceptual clarity over practical application. While it successfully touches the 'Heart' through poetry and 'Head' through doctrine, the 'Hands' remain relatively unengaged. The priority for improvement is to bridge the gap between the profound 'Image of God' theology and the daily 'Active Experimentation' of the believer in a sexualized culture. It is a well-crafted, sober, and intellectually stimulating piece that fulfills its purpose as a conference address but would require more pragmatic development for a typical Sunday morning parish context."
