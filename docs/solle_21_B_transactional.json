    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and largely game-free. It avoids the common homiletical trap of the 'Rescuer' role. By integrating the 'Dark Side' of the divine and personal vulnerability, the preacher validates the listener's reality (Adult) while providing a supportive framework (NP). It encourages the listener to move from a passive, fearful state (Adapted Child) to an active, wrestling state (Free Child/Adult).",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of self-disclosure (Adult transparency).",
      "Validation of difficult emotions (fear, desire for death) without immediate 'spiritual' suppression.",
      "Promotion of autonomy and 'holy audacity' (Free Child)."
    ],
    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "The critique of 'liberal errors' and 'modern feigheit' borders on Critical Parent judgment.",
      "The transition to political issues (Soweto, peace) is a sudden shift that might pull the listener out of the internal Adult reflection."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to monitor the 'Critical Parent' when discussing other theological viewpoints to ensure the sermon remains an invitation rather than a demand."
