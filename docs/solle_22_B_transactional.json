  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is psychologically robust and health-promoting. It avoids the common pitfalls of religious manipulation by grounding its authority in the shared experience of the 'Adult' and the supportive 'Nurturing Parent'. By humanizing the saint (Romero) and admitting his errors, the preacher removes the 'Critical Parent' pedestal, making the call to 'witness' an achievable Adult responsibility rather than an impossible Child-like ideal. The focus on 'learning from the poor' effectively dismantles the Rescuer/Victim dynamic often found in charitable or religious discourse.",
    "strengths": [
      "Demystification of 'Saints' to promote listener autonomy.",
      "Strong Adult-Adult address regarding the ability to perceive truth.",
      "Vulnerability in storytelling (the Tamale story)."

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Slight tendency toward 'Us vs. Them' regarding 'experts' or the 'Vatican', which could border on 'Ain't It Awful'.",
      "Could further explore the 'Free Child's' joy as a source of strength alongside 'Mut'."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to model vulnerability and the 'conversion of the preacher' by the congregation/the poor; this is the most effective safeguard against the Drama Triangle."
