    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. It utilizes a 'Parent-Child' dynamic that reinforces a 'Not-OK' position for the listener. By insisting on the phrase 'there is no health in us,' the preacher actively works against the psychological goal of 'Adult' autonomy and self-efficacy. The theology of grace is used as a 'Con' to lead the listener into a state of 'Adapted Child' compliance and shame-based identity.",

      "Strong use of metaphor to engage the Child ego's imagination.",
      "Clear articulation of a specific theological tradition."

      "Over-reliance on shame-based terminology ('miserable offenders').",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult invitation for the listener to find health and agency."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try addressing the congregation as 'Adults' capable of making moral choices, rather than 'Children' on the verge of self-destruction. Replace the 'Bait & Switch' of Grace/Law with a consistent message of inherent worth that invites responsibility rather than just 'fear' and 'misery.'"
