    "summary": "The sermon is a classic example of 'theological breaking.' It uses a Critical Parent ego position to dismantle the listener's Adult confidence by labeling the 'heart' as inherently deceitful. By utilizing 'Ain't It Awful' dynamics regarding pop culture, it creates a sense of existential dread (Adapted Child) that only the preacher's 'Rescuer' message (the New Covenant) can alleviate. While theologically orthodox in many traditions, psychologically it fosters dependency and shame rather than Adult autonomy.",

    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Address the congregation as Adult subjects capable of moral choice. Instead of saying 'the heart is deceitful,' explore the Adult reality of conflicting desires. Move from 'Rescuing' to 'Empowering' by showing how the New Covenant enables Adult responsibility rather than just providing an escape from 'madness'."
