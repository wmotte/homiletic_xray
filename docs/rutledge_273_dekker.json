Most of them were very well done, but during the more self-indulgent ones I found my attention drifting. I began wondering what trivial anecdotes [...] the dream of all humanity is summed up in the Cross and in the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. He goes to prepare a place for us at his own unending banquet. May he confirm this truth in your hearts, today and for ever. Amen."

  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The sermon stays close to the narrative of the Wedding at Cana. However, it struggles to identify what is unique to THIS text compared to other miracles. It treats the miracle as a general sign of 'abundance' rather than the specific 'first of signs' that marks the transition from old purification to new wine.",
      "quotes": [
        "In today’s reading from John’s Gospel, we discover Jesus at a wedding where the wine has run out."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Focus more sharply on the specific tension between the 'six stone jars' (the old order) and the 'good wine' (the new order) as a unique Johannine theological pivot."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The preacher provides some cultural context regarding Palestinian weddings and the jars of purification, but it remains at a surface level. There is no evidence of engagement with the original Greek or the specific theological structure of John's Gospel (the 'Hour').",
      "quotes": [
        "A wedding party in small-town Palestine would have been, hands down, the event of the year...",
        "They were there for the Jewish rite of purification."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exegesis of the 'Hour' (v. 4) and the significance of the 'third day' (v. 1) to move beyond cultural anecdotes into biblical theology."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 7,
      "findings": "The application is the strongest part of the sermon. The use of the personal ad from the New York Review of Books is a concrete, sharp illustration of the 'zeitgeist' Dekker mentions. It captures the modern sense of 'regret' and 'emptiness' effectively.",
      "quotes": [
        "Married man of means and mien looks for a woman who feels that there should have been more to it all.",
        "we buy something and charge it, we drink, we pop a pill, we grab for sexual adventure..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Ensure the application doesn't become a general psychological profile but remains tethered to the specific 'wine' of the text."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon follows a traditional 'sandwich' structure: a long anecdotal introduction, followed by a section of biblical commentary, ending with a general appeal. Exposition and application are largely separated blocks.",
      "quotes": [
        "Now back to the story. 'Do whatever he tells you,' says Mary...",
        "Not long ago I attended a memorial event... [first 4 paragraphs are purely anecdotal]"
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Integrate the 'regret' of the modern man directly into the narrative of the wine running out, rather than keeping them in separate sections."
    },
    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Misery is well-articulated through the lens of 'regret' and 'emptiness.' Redemption is present as the 'abundance' of Christ. Gratitude is the weakest part, appearing only briefly as 'service to others' at the end.",
      "quotes": [
        "we suffer from a sense that we are still hungry, still thirsty.",
        "He, the only-begotten... is the only One who is able to wipe away regret forever."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Develop the 'gratitude' section (the life of the believer after the miracle) more substantially to avoid a purely 'misery-redemption' loop."
    },
    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 3,
      "findings": "The sermon avoids the 'two ways.' While it mentions being 'in our sins,' there is no real sense of the possibility of being lost or the weight of eternal/temporal destruction. It leans toward a 'liberal' comfort.",
      "quotes": [
        "There is the promise of God through faith in Jesus Christ, and that is everything."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Address the consequence of remaining with the 'water of purification' (the old way) versus the 'new wine.' Make the choice for Christ a matter of life and death."
    },
    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "Christ is the telos, and the sermon concludes with a strong emphasis on His power to save. However, the Christology is somewhat generic and could be applied to almost any miracle story.",
      "quotes": [
        "The message of Epiphany is that the Son of God is powerful to save.",
        "the dream of all humanity is summed up in the Cross and in the Resurrection."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'glory' manifested at Cana more specifically to the 'glory' of the Cross, which is central to John's theology."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "At roughly 1450 words, the sermon likely clocks in at 14-15 minutes. According to Dekker's Thesis 8, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for true depth.",
      "quotes": [],
      "improvement_point": "Expand the exegetical and dogmatic sections to reach the 20-minute threshold, allowing the text to breathe more."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon fails the formal requirement of length and the substantive requirement of the 'two ways.' It relies too heavily on secular anecdotes (Edith Piaf, New York Review of Books) before engaging the text. While the psychological analysis of modern 'regret' is adequate, the biblical exposition is secondary and lacks linguistic or dogmatic depth.",
    "strengths": [
      "Effective use of cultural artifacts to illustrate human 'misery' (the personal ad).",
      "Clear identification of the failure of 'religious rituals' (the water jars) to provide true life."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (approx. 15 minutes) prevents theological depth.",
      "Lack of the 'two ways'; the sermon is overly comforting and lacks the 'creeping chill' of potential loss.",
      "Exposition and application are segmented rather than interwoven."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is a 'speech about the gospel' and human longing rather than a sermon in Dekker's strict sense. It lacks the necessary breadth (length) and the sharp edge of the 'two ways' to be considered a fully realized proclamation of the Word."
