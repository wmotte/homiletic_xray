  "analysis_per_criterion": {
    "1_specific_bible_passage": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon fails Dekker's requirement of focusing on one specific pericope. It jumps between Isaiah, Matthew, and Psalm 131. By treating the Bible as a collection of 'ideas' about parenthood rather than a specific word, it loses the 'nowhere else' quality Dekker demands.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Isaiah text is addressed to people...",
        "But let me tell you about our real father. Jesus addresses his disciples.",
        "That summons is wondrously situated in the assurance of the Psalm."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Select one text (e.g., Isaiah 49) and explore its specific historical and theological depth rather than using multiple texts to illustrate a general theme of 'family'."
    },
    "2_exegesis_original_context": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "There is a basic recognition of the historical context (exile/displacement), but it remains superficial. The preacher uses the text as a springboard for metaphors rather than rigorous exposition of the Hebrew/Greek nuances or the specific theology of Deutero-Isaiah.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Isaiah text is addressed to people in severe displacement...",
        "God remembers destroyed Jerusalem."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Deepen the exegesis of Isaiah 49:16. What does it mean for God to 'engrave' a name on palms in the Ancient Near Eastern context? Move beyond the Sarah Palin anecdote to the actual biblical theology."
    },
    "3_application_concrete_contemporary": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The application is concrete regarding social issues (poverty, prisons, narcissism), which aligns with Dekker's demand for relevance. However, it occasionally slips into general psychological categories ('self issues').",
      "quotes": [
        "it is the poor who fill the prisons, who have no other chance for rehabilitation.",
        "our society now is a place of anxiety and threat and selfishness and narcissism..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Make the application less about general 'social goods' and more about the specific 'now' of the congregation's life in relation to the specific text's promise."
    },
    "4_interwoveness_exposition_application": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "The sermon is structured in blocks (I, II, III, IV). Exposition and application are largely separated into 'what the text said' followed by 'what this means for us.' The 'present of revelation' is hindered by this mechanical structure.",
      "quotes": [
        "The poem in Isaiah... is addressed to ancient exiles... It is to them that God has declared...",
        "And here is the mandate for us and our society."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Dissolve the numbered sections. Allow the contemporary reality of the 'orphan' to be read directly through the lens of the Babylonian exile throughout the sermon."

    "5_three_parts_misery_redemption_gratitude": {
      "score_1_to_10": 6,
      "findings": "The movement from the misery of 'orphanness' and displacement to the redemption of God's 'motherly' care and the gratitude of 'covenant work' is present. It avoids being overly Christocentric by focusing on the Father/Mother God, which Dekker allows.",
      "quotes": [
        "cower in despair at being abandoned by the God...",
        "This is a mother who gathers all the children...",
        "sent again to be a covenant to the peoples."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Sharpen the 'misery' aspect. The sermon treats anxiety as a psychological state; Dekker would demand seeing it as misery 'before God'."

    "6_two_ways_seriousness_of_choice": {
      "score_1_to_10": 5,
      "findings": "The sermon touches on 'being lost in time' (social decay, narcissism), but lacks the 'ultimate possibility' or the 'eternal' weight Dekker describes. The choice is presented more as a healthy lifestyle change than a life-or-death spiritual destination.",
      "quotes": [
        "we readily become scavengers and cheats... doing damage to the body politic...",
        "We can quit acting like motherless, fatherless people..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Introduce the gravity of the 'two ways.' What is the ultimate consequence of remaining in the 'orphan' state? The sermon needs more 'threat' (in Dekker's sense) to be serious."

    "7_christocentric_grace": {
      "score_1_to_10": 4,
      "findings": "Christ is mentioned as a teacher (Matthew 6) and the table is mentioned, but Christ as the 'telos'—the God-man who is our life—is thin. He is more of an example of how to view the Father than the Savior in whom our life is hidden.",
      "quotes": [
        "Jesus addresses his disciples. They are worried...",
        "And Jesus says to them, do not worry..."
      ],
      "improvement_point": "Connect the 'motherly' care of God in Isaiah directly to the person of Christ. Christ should not just be a teacher of non-anxiety, but the one who embodies the 'engraved names' on the cross."
    },
    "8_depth_and_length": {
      "score_1_to_10": 2,
      "findings": "At approximately 950 words, this sermon would take less than 10 minutes to deliver. According to Thesis 8, this is insufficient for the 'breadth' required for theological depth.",
      "improvement_point": "The sermon must be expanded significantly. It skims the surface of three major biblical texts; it should instead go deep into one for at least 20 minutes."
    }
  },
  "overall_assessment": {
    "summary": "The sermon falls short of Dekker's criteria primarily due to its brevity and its 'keyword' approach to Scripture. By jumping between Isaiah, Matthew, and the Psalms, it fails to provide a specific exposition of a single pericope. It treats the Bible as a source of general themes (motherhood/fatherhood) rather than a unique, current Word. The duration is significantly below the 20-minute threshold required for depth.",
    "strengths": [
      "Concrete social application regarding poverty and the 'body politic'.",
      "Effective use of the 'misery-redemption-gratitude' triad through the orphan metaphor.",
      "Strong psychological awareness that avoids being purely clinical."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient length (approx. 9 minutes) prevents theological 'breadth'.",
      "Lack of a single specific Bible passage; it is a topical speech on 'God as parent'.",
      "Weak Christology; Jesus is a teacher/example rather than the ontological telos."
    ],
    "final_judgment_according_to_dekker": "This is not a sermon in the sense of Dekker's definition. It is a brief, thematic meditation. It lacks the specific exegetical rigor, the singular focus on one pericope, and the necessary duration to be considered a 'right proclamation of the Gospel' according to these theses."
