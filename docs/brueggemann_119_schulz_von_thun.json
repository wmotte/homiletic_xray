    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a clear exegetical framework based on the Double Commandment of Love. The 'Sache' is defined as the identity of the 'neighbor' across three levels: the spouse, the poor, and God. While the logic is consistent, the dogmatic depth regarding the 'living Christ' (Barth) is somewhat thin. The sermon operates primarily on a horizontal plane of ethics and anthropology. The theological content is reduced to 'generosity and forgiveness' as functional tools for life management rather than an ontological change in the believer. It is highly comprehensible but borders on the 'didactic-moralistic' where the mystery of the sacrament is replaced by a social-ethical category.",
      "quotes": [
        "The two conditions of Christian life and Christian marriage are to love God and love neighbor.",
        "The command pertains to marriage because in marriage one finds one’s supreme neighbor.",
        "God is the ultimate neighbor to whom one goes for generosity and forgiveness."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear structural logic based on the 'neighbor' metaphor.",

        "Deepen the Christological foundation; why is Christ the source of this love?",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a sober, perhaps slightly cynical or 'realistic' view of life and marriage. There is a conscious effort to appear as a 'wise realist' who is not fooled by romanticism. The 'green' side leaks a certain intellectual distance. The use of phrases like 'going to hell in a hand basket' reveals a preacher who is frustrated with societal trends, suggesting a 'Compulsive' need for order and social responsibility. The 'I' is largely hidden behind the 'We' of the teacher, which prevents the sermon from becoming a personal testimony but also keeps the congregation at a professional distance.",
      "quotes": [
        "Our society is going to hell in a hand basket.",
        "I bring up the phrase because after romantic utopianism...",
        "I think that is why Jesus linked 'love God' and 'love neighbor'..."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive-Schizoid. The preacher values structure, duty, and clear definitions (Compulsive) and maintains a professional, slightly detached distance from the emotional 'utopia' of a wedding (Schizoid).",
      "diaconal_quality": "The self-revelation is diaconal in that it serves the instruction of the couple, but it lacks the 'vulnerability' that might make the grace of God more tangible.",
      "strengths": [

        "Projects authority and stability."

        "Allow more 'Depressive' warmth; marriage is also a celebration of joy, not just a 'demanding' duty.",
        "Reduce the 'grumpy' societal commentary which distracts from the self-revelation of faith."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher to Students.' The preacher takes a paternalistic stance, correcting the 'unreality' of the couple's romantic feelings. There is a significant amount of 'relationship noise' created by the sharp critique of 'therapeutic, consumer society.' This may make the hearers feel judged or patronized during a celebratory occasion. The 'We-definition' is one of a shared struggle against a failing society, which might alienate those who do not share the preacher's cultural pessimism. The tone is more 'Instructional' than 'Solidary'.",

        "Newly married persons are permitted that unreality for a few weeks or months.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward 'Anspruch' (Demand). The opening line sets the tone: 'not complicated, only demanding.' The Gospel (Zuspruch) is treated almost as a functional resource for when the Law becomes too hard to fulfill. God is the 'Holy Neighbor' we use for 'generosity and forgiveness' so we can get back to the work of being good neighbors. This risks falling into moralism where faith is a means to an ethical end. The 'red' side dominates: the couple must love the spouse, then the poor, then use God to fix the 'unpleasantnesses.'",
      "quotes": [
        "Living a Christian life is... demanding.",

      "risk_of_moralism": "High. The sermon frames marriage as an 'endless burden' and a social duty.",
      "strengths": [
        "Strong call to social justice and awareness of the poor.",

  "congruence_and_disruptions": {
    "congruence_judgment": "The sermon is congruent in its 'sternness.' The preacher's words, tone, and theology all point toward a serious, duty-bound view of the world. However, there is an incongruence between the 'Wedding Feast' context and the 'Funeral for Society' tone.",
    "dominant_side": "Red (Appeal/Demand)",
    "disruptions": "The 'Yellow' relationship side is disrupted by the preacher's cultural critique, which may feel like 'noise' to a couple focused on their vows.",
    "healing_disruption": "The disruption of 'romantic utopia' is intended to be prophetic, but it feels more like a psychological 'cold shower' than a 'Healing Disruption' of the Spirit."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 5.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a robust, albeit stern, application of the Great Commandment to the context of marriage. It successfully moves the focus from a private 'ego-ism for two' to a public, ethical 'neighborliness.' However, from a Schulz von Thun perspective, the 'Appeal' side is overdeveloped at the expense of the 'Relational' warmth expected at a wedding. Theologically, it leans heavily on the Law (Anspruch). God is presented as a 'Holy Neighbor'—a functional helper—rather than the Sovereign Lord of Grace (Barth). The 'Riemann' diagnosis suggests a preacher who finds safety in duty and structure, which provides clarity but lacks the 'diaconal' vulnerability that allows a congregation to feel the 'Zuspruch' of the Gospel. The critique of society, while perhaps valid, creates 'relationship noise' that may hinder the reception of the core message.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a risk of 'psychologizing' God into a 'Neighbor' who exists to provide 'generosity' for our human projects, rather than God being the Acting Subject who creates the relationship.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Excellent use of the 'Neighbor' metaphor to unify the sermon.",
      "Courageous rejection of sentimental wedding platitudes.",
      "Clear, logical structure that is easy to follow."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Balance the 'Demanding' nature of the Gospel with its 'Liberating' nature.",
      "Reduce the paternalistic tone regarding 'romantic unreality.'",
      "Ground the ethics in a more explicit Christology (the 'Blue' side)."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A solid, demanding sermon that serves as a necessary ethical corrective but fails to fully celebrate the joy of the Gospel or the occasion."
