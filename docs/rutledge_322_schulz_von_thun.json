  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a solid exegetical foundation, particularly in the distinction between the earthly and transcendent Jerusalem and the Christological 'emptying' (Kenosis) from Philippians. The 'Sache' is the confrontation between the Power of Darkness and the Kingdom of God. The factual side is well-structured, moving from contemporary cultural observation to biblical narrative. However, the connection between the 'two Jerusalems' remains somewhat abstract; the preacher assumes a dogmatic framework that might not be fully transparent to a secularized listener. The theological depth is present but leans heavily on narrative repetition rather than deep dogmatic drilling into the 'why' of the atonement, focusing instead on the 'how' of the event.",
      "quotes": [
        "But there are two Jerusalems—the earthly one and the transcendent, perfected Jerusalem.",
        "Jesus knowingly stages his own entrance... not on the war horse... but on the lowly beast of burden.",
        "The evangelist Luke sharpens the point by adding, 'They [the people] were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified'."

        "The transition between the 'Chinese laundry' anecdote and the 'Power of Darkness' is a large leap in factual gravity.",
        "Could benefit from more precise definition of 'the Powers' beyond literary references."
      ],
      "comprehensibility_check": "High. The language is accessible, and the use of cultural touchstones (advertising, news) aids understanding."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a person who is culturally observant and slightly alienated by the secularization of the 'Holy Land' and 'Easter'. There is an involuntary 'leak' of cultural nostalgia and perhaps a slight irritation with the 'Chinese laundry' owners' ignorance of liturgy. This reveals a preacher who values order and tradition (liturgical correctness). The 'I' is used primarily as a witness to the world's indifference. While authentic, the self-revelation stays within the bounds of 'professional observer' rather than 'struggling sinner,' until the very end where the preacher identifies with the thief. The green side is controlled, serving the message but maintaining a certain pulpit-distance.",
      "quotes": [
        "My sense of something askew was compounded when I spent some time in various locations...",
        "I wonder if you have noticed that the news articles have seemed more and more to have less and less to do with Christianity.",

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive/Schizoid. The preacher shows a strong need for liturgical correctness (Compulsive) and maintains a diagnostic distance from the 'secular stories' (Schizoid), observing the world from a study or a bookstore rather than from within the 'alternative stories'.",
      "diaconal_quality": "Generally diaconal. The personal anecdotes serve to illustrate the 'alternative story' thesis, though the 'Chinese laundry' example borders on trivializing the theological weight of the Passion.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is primarily 'Teaching/Parental'. The preacher addresses the congregation as 'you, the people of this congregation' who have 'made a very important choice'. This creates a 'we-definition' of an intentional community in a hostile/indifferent world. However, there is a subtle 'from above' tone when the preacher 'begs' the congregation or instructs them on which services to attend (Maundy Thursday). The relationship is solidary in sin ('It was us'), which mitigates the paternalism. The yellow side is functional but lacks a certain warmth, focusing more on the 'duty' of the community to stay true to its story.",

        "You, the people of this congregation, have made a very important choice today.",
        "I beg you, do not let any secular story or alternative story take priority...",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavy on appeal (Anspruch). The primary demand is: 'Do not let secular stories take priority' and 'Be here for Holy Week'. While the theological 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is present in the final paragraph (the thief in paradise), the bulk of the sermon functions as a call to attention and a call to liturgical participation. The 'Zuspruch' is conditional: 'if you believe this... then you will want to be here'. This risks turning the Gospel into a 'work' of narrative immersion. The 'healing disruption' is the insistence that 'we' are the crucifiers, which is a necessary Law-application, but the 'Gift' of the Gospel is somewhat delayed until the very end.",
      "quotes": [
        "I beg you, do not let any secular story or alternative story take priority...",

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Leans toward Anspruch (Demand). The promise of Paradise is the 'reward' for identifying with the thief and attending the 'banquet table'.",

  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 6.2,
    "summary": "This is a solid, traditional Passion Sunday sermon that effectively diagnoses the 'narrative competition' in modern society. The preacher successfully uses the Schulz von Thun 'Blue' side to lay out the contrast between secular and sacred stories. However, the 'Red' side (Appeal) is overly dominant, particularly in the pragmatic calls to attend Holy Week services, which can feel like 'liturgical law' rather than 'Gospel promise'. Theologically, it follows a Barthian emphasis on the 'objective' event of the Cross, but it risks psychologizing the 'experience' of the story as the primary means of grace. The Riemann diagnosis suggests a preacher who values the 'correct' story and 'correct' liturgy (Compulsive) as a bulwark against cultural chaos. The 'Yellow' side (Relationship) is solidary in sin but somewhat distant in grace. The sermon's greatest strength is its refusal to sanitize the 'Power of Darkness', yet its greatest weakness is the 'managerial' tone regarding church attendance which disrupts the kerygmatic flow.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a slight risk of 'story-theology' replacing the 'Acting Subject' (God). The sermon suggests that 'immersing ourselves in the story' is what saves us, rather than the God who acts regardless of our immersion.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Sharp cultural analysis of 'alternative stories'.",
      "Strong identification of the congregation with the 'crucifiers'.",
      "Effective use of the 'two thieves' as a closing metaphor."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Remove administrative announcements (Maundy Thursday details) from the kerygmatic core.",
      "Balance the 'Anspruch' of attending services with the 'Zuspruch' of Christ's finished work.",
      "Deepen the 'Green' side by showing how the preacher also struggles with the 'seductive' secular stories."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively competent sermon that serves the liturgical season well but struggles to fully liberate the Gospel from the 'demand' of liturgical participation."
