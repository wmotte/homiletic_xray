    "risk_explanation": "The only risk is a potential 'Ain't It Awful' game regarding the state of the world, but the preacher moves through it to 'The Stronger Man' (Adult/NP solution)."

    "psychological_health_score": 9,
    "summary": "This sermon is a model of psychologically healthy homiletics in a time of crisis. It avoids the common trap of using trauma to enforce regression into the Adapted Child (fear-based obedience). By using the Adult ego state to analyze 'hard news' and the Nurturing Parent to provide comfort, the preacher fosters resilience and autonomy. The preacher’s vulnerability ('Michael, where were you?') models an authentic Free Child/Adult integration that invites the congregation to process their own grief without shame.",
    "strengths": [
      "High level of transparency and Adult-to-Adult communication.",

      "The transition to supporting military action could potentially trigger an 'Adapted Child' response in some listeners, though it is handled with Adult nuance."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Continue to use 'we' language (fellow sinners/saints) to maintain a level playing field and prevent the 'Parent-Child' hierarchy that leads to psychological games."
