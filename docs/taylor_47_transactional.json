  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 3,
    "summary": "The sermon is psychologically regressive. While it uses high-empathy language, it ultimately reinforces a Parent-Child dynamic that rewards passivity and the spiritualization of trauma. By framing God as a 'purger' who intentionally causes 'bruises' and 'tears,' it risks creating a 'Stockholm Syndrome' spirituality where the victim must love the source of their pain. It lacks Adult-Adult engagement, offering no room for the listener to process grief outside of a submissive framework.",

      "Strong use of metaphor to provide a sense of meaning."

      "Lack of Adult ego engagement; the listener is not treated as a responsible agent.",
      "Over-romanticization of pain ('Sorrow taught me to sing').",
      "Potential for spiritual abuse by justifying 'the knife' as divine love."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Incorporate Adult ego transactions by asking the congregation how they might practically navigate their hurts. Move away from the 'Rescuer' role by acknowledging that some pain is simply tragic and not necessarily a 'pruning' by God. Encourage the 'Free Child' to find joy in health, not just in 'brokenness'."
