    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a solid exegetical foundation by focusing on the 'chosen witnesses' in Acts 10. The 'Sache' (the living Christ) is presented not as a general historical fact, but as a specific revelation to a selected group. The preacher correctly identifies the 'different order' of the risen body, moving beyond mere resuscitation to a theological understanding of vindication. The connection between the Resurrection and the 'way of the Cross' prevents the content from becoming cheap triumphalism. However, the transition from the exclusivity of the witnesses to the personal healing anecdote feels like a jump in the 'blue' logic, shifting from dogmatic clarity to experiential evidence.",
      "quotes": [
        "The Resurrection of Jesus was not a proof given by God to stun unbelievers into faith.",
        "Jesus' risen body, though it was palpably real, was of a different order from his earthly body.",
        "The Resurrection did not create new faith so much as it validated the faith that had already been placed."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear distinction between historical proof and theological vindication.",
        "Strong integration of Pauline theology (2 Cor 4) to ground the Easter message."

        "The connection between the 'Name of Jesus' and the specific healing story could be more dogmatically grounded.",
        "Greater clarity on the 'different order' of the risen body would strengthen the blue side."

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher displays significant authenticity, moving from a 'depressive' seeking of harmony (praising the congregation for being there) to a vulnerable 'hysterical' (in the sense of stage-presence) revelation of a personal miracle. The admission of feeling 'inadequate' and 'scared' by the healing story provides a deep green layer that serves the text rather than the ego. It is a 'diaconal' self-revelation: the preacher's weakness becomes the vessel for God's power. The 'leakage' of disappointment regarding low attendance is honest and relatable, establishing a human-to-human connection before the theological heavy lifting begins.",
      "quotes": [
        "It's always hard, I think at least it is for me - to see the falling-off... without a twinge of disappointment.",
        "I have never told this story before and may never tell it again; it scares me still.",
        "You can't imagine how inadequate I felt."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Primarily Depressive/Hysterical. The preacher seeks closeness and harmony with the 'family' of the church (Depressive) but uses a powerful, dramatic personal narrative to create an emotional impact (Hysterical/Expressive).",
      "diaconal_quality": "High. The personal story is used to illustrate the 'sovereign freedom' of God, not the preacher's own holiness.",

        "Honesty about pastoral disappointment."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is initially defined as 'family'—warm, inclusive, and appreciative. However, the preacher then shifts to a more challenging 'teaching' stance, almost paternalistic, by asking 'Are you perhaps getting worried about where this is going?'. This creates a tension between the 'we-definition' of the family and the 'you-message' of being chosen/sent. The use of 'Get over it!' regarding the Name of Jesus is a sharp relational signal that breaks the 'Low Sunday' politeness, aiming for a 'solidary' but firm push toward apostolic identity.",
      "quotes": [
        "Many of you are here because you are, in one sense or another, members of the family.",
        "I don't understand why we Episcopalians got this idea... 'Get over it!'",
        "I suggest to you that you think of this as good news."

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily a call to 'witness' and 'testify'. The preacher successfully anchors this in 'Zuspruch' (Promise): the Holy Spirit is the 'engine' and 'fuel'. The demand (Anspruch) is not to work harder, but to 'tell' what has been received. There is a clear attempt to avoid moralism by stating 'He will show you what he has for you.' However, the appeal to 'tell your children... tell your friends' can land as a heavy burden if the listener does not feel the 'power from on high' described. The ratio favors Promise, but the 'witness' demand is insistent.",
      "quotes": [
        "Do not go out from here with a furrowed brow, worrying about what you are supposed to do for him in return.",
        "Tell your children. Tell your grandchildren. Tell your friends.",
        "Bring the news especially to those who are suffering."

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "The promise (God has chosen you/The Spirit is the fuel) provides the basis for the demand (Tell others).",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Low, because the preacher emphasizes that the power is 'not up to you'.",
      "strengths": [
        "Strong emphasis on the Holy Spirit as the acting subject.",
        "The appeal is framed as a natural consequence of 'eating and drinking' with the Lord."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition to 'tell your grandchildren' could be more explicitly linked back to the 'healing' power mentioned earlier."

    "disruptions": "The main disruption is the shift from the 'low' energy of the 'Low Sunday' introduction to the 'high' energy of the healing miracle story.",

    "the_factual_ear_hears": "God only appeared to believers; the Resurrection validates suffering; the Holy Spirit is the power source for the church.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a sophisticated exercise in homiletical balance. It begins with a 'depressive' relational warmth, acknowledging the 'family' present on a 'Low Sunday,' but quickly pivots to a 'blue' theological depth regarding the exclusivity of the Resurrection witnesses. The preacher avoids the trap of moralism by shifting the focus from human effort to the 'sovereign freedom' of God. The 'green' side is the sermon's greatest strength; the inclusion of a personal, frighteningly successful prayer for healing provides a 'healing disruption' that moves the sermon from a lecture to a testimony. Theologically, it aligns with Immink’s focus on God as the Acting Subject. While the 'yellow' side occasionally borders on the paternalistic with 'Get over it,' the overall congruence between the preacher’s vulnerability and the message of divine power is strong. It avoids 'American superlatives' by maintaining a sober tone even when discussing the miraculous.",
    "barthian_warning": "There is a slight risk of psychologization in the healing story, but the preacher mitigates this by emphasizing that the event 'scares' her and was 'not up to her,' thus maintaining God's transcendence.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Authentic and diaconal self-revelation.",
      "Clear theological distinction between 'proof' and 'vindication'.",
      "Strong pneumatological focus (Holy Spirit as the engine)."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Reduce the initial flattery of the congregation to sharpen the 'blue' side earlier.",
      "Refine the 'Get over it' phrasing to maintain a more 'eye-level' relationship.",
      "Bridge the gap between the Acts 10 exegesis and the personal healing story more tightly."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A strong, congruent sermon that uses psychological vulnerability to serve a robust theological claim."
