  "conclusion_and_recommendation": {
    "psychological_health_score": 4,
    "summary": "The sermon utilizes a classic Parent-Child dynamic. It begins by using the Critical Parent to induce a sense of existential guilt and 'godly sorrow,' labeling those who don't feel it as 'thoughtless.' Once the listener is in the Adapted Child state (feeling the 'burden'), the preacher switches to the Nurturing Parent/Rescuer to offer a simple spiritualized solution. This creates a cycle of dependency where the listener is made to feel small and 'perverse' only to be 'rescued' by the preacher's message.",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Over-reliance on 'must' and 'should' (Critical Parent).",
      "Lack of Adult-to-Adult engagement; doesn't ask the listener to think, but tells them *how* they must feel."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "Try using more 'I' statements regarding your own Adult observations of the year rather than 'You' or 'We' statements that prescribe emotions. Invite the congregation to evaluate their own year using their Adult ego state rather than demanding a Child-like 'sorrow' as a prerequisite for grace."
