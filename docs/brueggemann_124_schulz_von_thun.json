    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a clear exegetical arc from Peter’s vision in Acts to the sermon at Cornelius' house. The 'Sache' (the living Christ) is presented through the lens of God's impartiality and the resurrection. However, the theological depth remains somewhat horizontal. While the 'blue' side correctly identifies the shift from Jewish purity laws to Gentile inclusion, it quickly pivots to social categories (race, gender, class). The Barthian 'Living Christ' is present but risks being instrumentalized as a catalyst for social reform rather than being the 'Wholly Other' who interrupts human history. The factual content is highly comprehensible but leans toward a sociological interpretation of the Kingdom of God.",
      "quotes": [
        "I truly understand that God shows no partiality.",
        "The old purity laws of his people no longer pertained.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a persona deeply concerned with social justice and the 'war on baptism' in modern society. There is a sense of prophetic urgency, yet the 'I' remains largely hidden behind a 'We' or a diagnostic 'They'. The self-revelation 'leaks' a certain level of frustration with the current political and social climate. The preacher identifies as an enlightened observer of the 'old world's' failures. There is little vulnerability regarding the preacher's own struggle with the 'old world' habits; the 'I' is positioned as the one who understands the 'plunge' rather than one who is still drowning in the need for grace.",
      "quotes": [
        "I mean the entire Western world, not just California!",
        "We have for a long time assumed God’s partiality.",
        "Do I need to tell you that we presently have in our society a war on baptism?"
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive with Hysterical undertones. The preacher seeks to impose a correct, structured 'new world' order (Compulsive) while using provocative, stage-oriented language about a 'war on baptism' (Hysterical).",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' serves the social agenda of the text but occasionally overshadows the 'I' of the Gospel promise with the 'I' of the social critic.",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined largely through a 'teaching' and 'admonishing' lens. The preacher speaks 'from above'—diagnosing the congregation's (and society's) failures regarding white privilege, nationalism, and lack of forgiveness. There is a risk of 'Relationship Noise' where the hearer feels categorized rather than called. The use of 'we' often feels like a rhetorical 'you' in disguise, which can lead to the 'Relationship Ear' of the listener closing in defense. The preacher assumes a high degree of alignment with their socio-political diagnosis, which may alienate those who do not immediately see the 'war on baptism' in the same terms.",
      "quotes": [
        "We continue to imagine we are chosen of God.",
        "White privilege among us is simply normative and unexamined.",
        "Do I need to tell you...?"

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The sermon is heavily weighted toward the 'Appeal'. The 'Zuspruch' (Promise) of baptism is quickly converted into an 'Anspruch' (Demand) for social change and behavioral shifts regarding privilege and debt. While the preacher mentions forgiveness, it is framed as an 'engine' for the world—a functional tool for social harmony rather than a radical gift from God to the sinner. The 'Red Side' dominates: the listener is urged to reject nationalism, white privilege, and score-keeping. The theological failure here is that the 'Gift' feels like a 'Task'. The pressure on the 'Appeal Ear' is high, potentially leading to guilt or reactive resistance rather than the 'Rest' of faith.",
      "quotes": [
        "The baptized church is an engine for forgiveness.",

        "The truth of baptism is that all the old privileged arrangements are swept away."

      "strengths": [
        "Clear call to action.",

    "disruptions": "The main disruption is 'Relationship Noise'. The preacher's diagnostic tone creates a barrier for the 'Yellow Ear'.",
    "healing_disruption": "The critique of 'white privilege' and 'nationalism' acts as a disruption, but it feels more like a political disruption than a 'Healing Disruption' of the Spirit, as it lacks a clear path to the Cross for the 'privileged'."

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 5.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is a robust example of the 'Prophetic-Social' homiletical style. It successfully bridges the Petrine narrative with contemporary American issues. However, from a Schulz von Thun perspective, it suffers from an overactive 'Appeal' side and significant 'Relationship Noise'. Theologically, it leans toward a 'Social Gospel' where the 'Sache' (Christ) becomes a means to an end (social justice). The Barthian warning is relevant here: God risks becoming an object of our social conversation rather than the Acting Subject. The 'Zuspruch' of baptism—that we are God's beloved children regardless of our 'old world' failures—is present but quickly buried under the 'Anspruch' of the new world's requirements. The preacher's Riemann type (Compulsive/Hysterical) drives a sermon that is more about 'correcting' the hearer than 'nurturing' the believer. It is a 'Satisfactory' sermon because it is clear and relevant, but it lacks the 'Exceptional' balance of grace and truth.",
    "barthian_warning": "High psychologization and sociologization. The 'New World' is described more as a human social project than a divine eschatological reality.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Excellent use of contemporary metaphors.",
      "Clear, logical structure.",
      "Courageous addressing of difficult social topics."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Balance the 'Anspruch' with more radical 'Zuspruch'.",
      "Reduce paternalistic 'Relationship Noise'.",
      "Deepen the Christological 'Blue Side' to avoid moralism."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A communicatively clear but theologically lopsided sermon that prioritizes social appeal over the restorative promise of the Gospel."
