    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in 'showing' rather than 'telling' by excavating the visual layers of the 'Lamb' metaphor. Rutledge moves beyond the 'sentimental Victorian' image of a mild lamb to the 'Great Horned Lamb' of apocalyptic literature and the visceral 'blood-sprinkled' imagery of the Temple. By invoking the 'stench' of sacrifice and the 'shiver' of the Passover night, she creates a cinematic experience for the hearer. The imagery is not merely decorative; it is hermeneutical, forcing the listener to see the 'battle flag' and the 'slaughtered' reality of Christ. This aligns with Paul Scott Wilson's emphasis on sensory language to evoke the 'trouble' and 'grace' of the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Lambs standing up with flags, lambs lying down with flags, lambs lying on books.",
        "Then one of the lambs begins to grow horns... A sword is then given to this great horned Lamb.",
        "The hushing of the children, the anticipation of freedom, the fear of the unknown—and all the while, the knowledge that the angel of death was about to pass over."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Exceptional use of 'reframing' (Cilliers) by replacing sentimental imagery with biblical-apocalyptic power.",
        "Sensory engagement with the Passover narrative (hushing children, dipping hyssop).",
        "Effective use of art history and music (Agnus Dei) to ground the image in cultural memory."

      "improvement_points": [
        "The transition from the 'horned lamb' to the 'slaughtered lamb' could be more visually bridged.",
        "Some contemporary images (TV commercials) feel slightly dated compared to the timeless biblical imagery.",
        "The 'cybertechnology' reference remains abstract and lacks a concrete visual anchor."

      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strongly 'show' oriented; the preacher paints four distinct 'canvases' of the Lamb before moving to the theological 'tell'."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "Rutledge demonstrates high 'stewardship of language' (McEntyre). She carefully deconstructs religious jargon like 'Atonement' or 'Lamb of God' by providing historical and literary precision. Her word choice is economical yet evocative. She avoids the 'Canaanite' trap by explaining the 'whimsical' nature of the lamb image before subverting it with the 'battle flag' concept. The language is intellectually rigorous, citing Alexander Maclaren and the Epistle to the Hebrews with academic clarity that remains accessible to a lay audience. There is a clear effort to do justice to the 'nuance of human experience' regarding the failure of moral progress.",
      "quotes": [
        "The myth of human moral progress died in Auschwitz.",
        "We are not even aware that it is open to multiple interpretations, some of them very wide of the mark.",

        "The list of church failures (sexual abusers, etc.) is necessary but could be more precisely integrated into the 'Lamb' metaphor.",
        "Occasional use of 'we all could have guessed' assumes a homogeneity in the audience."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "Theological jargon (expiation, propitiation, oblation) is used intentionally and explained through narrative context, preventing it from becoming 'paper language'."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon possesses a rhythmic cadence, particularly in the concluding section where the repetition of 'It is you...' creates a liturgical 'legato'. The sentence structures vary effectively between short, punchy declarations ('The winner carries away the banner...') and longer, complex theological arguments. There is a palpable 'flow' that suggests the text was written for the ear, utilizing rhetorical figures like parallelism and alliteration ('bondage into freedom', 'behold and believe'). The use of the 'Agnus Dei' as a musical leitmotif at the beginning sets a rhythmic tone that echoes throughout the text.",
      "quotes": [
        "Lambs standing up with flags, lambs lying down with flags, lambs lying on books.",
        "It is you who are 'washed in the blood of the Lamb.' It is you who, like Isaac, have been snatched back...",
        "Over and over and over, there is a daily reminder that sin continues."

      "strengths": [
        "Strong use of anaphora in the conclusion to drive home personal application.",
        "Effective variation in sentence length to maintain attention.",

      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The middle section involving the four points can feel slightly 'list-like' and lose the rhythmic momentum.",
        "Some parenthetical asides (e.g., about the book of Enoch) break the musical flow of the narrative.",
        "The transition from Isaiah 53 to 20th-century history is a sharp rhythmic shift that could be smoother."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Oral language; the text is clearly designed for performance and liturgical proclamation."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7.33,
    "summary_language": "The poetics of the sermon are characterized by a 'sober beauty' and intellectual precision. Rutledge avoids the 'kitsch' of sentimental piety by using visceral, biblical imagery that 'reframes' the Lamb from a pet to a protagonist. Her language care is evident in the way she handles complex theological concepts with clarity and rhythmic force. The 'show, don't tell' principle is applied effectively, particularly in the Passover and Isaac narratives, creating a sensory-rich environment for the hearer to encounter the 'extra nos' of the Gospel."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a 'didactic-narrative' arc. It begins by upsetting the equilibrium of the 'sentimental lamb' and then moves through four 'clues' to rediscover the true meaning. While it isn't a strict 'Lowry Loop,' it creates tension by contrasting modern ignorance with ancient 'floods of associations.' The turning point occurs when the preacher moves from the 'what' (the definition of the Lamb) to the 'who' (the personal application in the 'Great Exchange'). However, the four-point structure can feel somewhat static, resembling a lecture more than a journey, until the final crescendo.",
      "quotes": [
        "A person of today... thinks of nothing particular. A person of New Testament times, however, would immediately have been flooded with associations.",
        "But where is the lamb for the sacrifice?",
        "It is you who, like Isaac, have been snatched back from the very brink of the grave."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "The 'Isaac' story is used as a powerful dramatic climax.",
        "The opening successfully creates a 'need to know' by exposing cultural ignorance.",
        "The conclusion provides a strong resolution that connects the historical 'then' to the liturgical 'now'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The four-point structure (First, Second, Third, Fourth) is a bit 'homiletically traditional' and can feel predictable.",
        "The transition into the 'problem of evil' (Auschwitz) feels like a second introduction rather than a continuation of the arc.",
        "The energy dips slightly during the technical explanation of the Epistle to the Hebrews."
      ],
      "plot_diagnosis": "A hybrid of a static point-structure and a dynamic journey; the final third carries the most dramaturgical weight."
    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is the sermon's greatest structural strength. Rutledge masterfully 'reframes' (Cilliers) the biblical text within the context of modern disillusionment. She uses the failure of the 20th century (Auschwitz, clergy scandals) not as a distraction, but as the necessary 'trouble' that the 'Lamb of God' must address. The integration is not forced; she respects the 'strangeness' of the blood sacrifice while making it the only logical answer to 'bottomless depths of wickedness.' The 'Great Exchange' is presented as a new frame for reality that transcends modern optimism.",
      "quotes": [
        "The myth of human moral progress died in Auschwitz.",
        "The efficacy of Christ's sacrifice cannot be proven by the behavior of Christians.",
        "How could someone's death two thousand years ago have anything to do with Sin and Death today?"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Honest engagement with the 'squeamishness' of modern hearers regarding blood.",
        "Brilliant synthesis of the Isaac narrative with the Christological 'substitution'.",
        "The sermon offers a radical 'new perspective' rather than confirming existing cultural values."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The connection between 'cybertechnology' and 'wickedness' could be more explicitly drawn.",
        "The mention of 'bishops and nuns' might feel specific to a certain denominational context, potentially distancing others.",
        "A more direct link between the 'horned lamb' of Enoch and modern power structures could enhance the reframing."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Strong reframing; the sermon moves the hearer from a sentimental frame to an apocalyptic-substitutionary frame."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon is an 'open work of art' (Stark) in the sense that it acknowledges the 'mystery' and the lack of 'satisfactory answers' to ongoing evil. It treats the hearer as a mature partner who can handle the 'shiver' of the Passover. However, theologically, it is quite 'sealed' in its substitutionary atonement dogmatics. While it leaves the *problem* of evil open, it closes the *solution* quite firmly. The ending is an invitation, but it is a very specific, directed invitation ('Behold!'). It allows for 'resistance' by acknowledging the 'sneers' of skeptics, yet it remains a monovalent witness to a specific theological tradition.",
      "quotes": [
        "There are no satisfactory 'answers' to the question about ongoing evil.",
        "We are not given an 'answer'; we are given the Son of God himself.",
        "The point is that you behold and believe that you yourself are one for whom Christ died."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledges the 'ambivalence of existence' by naming the persistence of sin in the church.",
        "The 'Behold' is presented as a revelatory invitation rather than a moralistic command.",
        "Respects the mystery of God's 'Great Exchange'."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The conclusion is somewhat 'prescriptive' in its application of the 'Great Exchange'.",
        "The four-point 'clue' structure can feel like a closed system of information.",
        "There is little room for the 'already/not yet' tension in the final application; it leans heavily on the 'once for all'."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Moderately open; it honors the mystery of suffering but is dogmatically firm on the mechanism of grace."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 6.67,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetics are defined by a strong 'reframing' of the biblical narrative against the backdrop of modern despair. While the four-point structure is somewhat traditional, the sermon achieves a powerful narrative arc by moving from the 'sentimental' to the 'sacrificial' and finally to the 'personal.' The integration of text and context is profound, using the 'strangeness' of the Bible to critique the 'myth of progress.' It maintains a balance between the 'trouble' of human wickedness and the 'grace' of God's provision, ultimately opening a space for faith in the midst of unresolvable mystery."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 9,
    "analysis": "This sermon is a rigorous critique of religious kitsch. Rutledge explicitly identifies the 'sentimental Victorian' lamb as a 'cultural bias' and 'kitsch' (though she doesn't use the word, she describes the phenomenon). She refuses the 'happy ending' that ignores Auschwitz or clergy scandals. By focusing on the 'blood,' the 'slaughter,' and the 'anguish' of Abraham, she provides authentic aesthetic depth. The emotions evoked are not 'pre-chewed' sentiment but 'authentic' shivers of recognition of the holy and the horrific.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'mild, meek, and gentle' Victorian Jesus.",
      "The idea that 'civilized humanity' is on a path of moral progress."

      "The naming of 'bottomless depths of wickedness' in the 20th century."

    "recommendation": "Maintain this high level of 'anti-kitsch' by continuing to contrast 'sentimental religion' with 'biblical revelation'."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 8,
    "analysis": "Space is opened for grace precisely through the 'extra nos' (outside of us) nature of the sacrifice. By emphasizing that 'we cannot produce our own salvation,' Rutledge removes the moralistic burden from the hearer. The 'Space for Grace' (Cilliers) is created in the 'between'—between the 'wood and the knife' and the 'provided lamb.' The sermon sustains the tension of ongoing sin while pointing to a 'completely recreated future.' It respects the mystery of the 'Great Exchange' without explaining it away as a simple moral lesson.",
    "tension_sustained": "Yes, the tension between the 'efficacy of Christ' and the 'behavior of Christians' is left painfully open.",
    "mystery_respected": "Yes, the preacher explicitly states that we are not given an 'answer' but a 'Person'.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails; the sermon ends with what God has done, not what the hearer must do.",
    "recommendation": "To increase space even further, allow the 'silence' of the Maundy Thursday context to speak more within the text itself."
  },
  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust example of 'Theological Realism' in preaching. It avoids the pitfalls of both dry intellectualism and sentimental kitsch by grounding its rhetoric in the visceral imagery of the biblical text. The preacher acts as a 'witness' (Long), pointing the congregation toward a reality that is 'extra nos'—the Lamb of God. The aesthetic power lies in the 'reframing' of a tired symbol (the lamb) into a multi-layered icon of conquest, sacrifice, and deliverance. While the structure is somewhat traditional, the 'stewardship of language' and the 'cinematic' quality of the narrative scenes (Passover, Isaac) create a profound 'event' (Immink) for the listener. The sermon successfully opens a 'space for grace' by taking the 'trouble' of human sin seriously and refusing to offer cheap, moralistic solutions. It is a 'sober-Reformed' aesthetic that finds beauty in the 'Great Exchange' and the 'once-for-all' efficacy of Christ.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Masterful 'reframing' of the Lamb image from sentiment to apocalyptic power.",
      "High 'anti-kitsch' quality that takes human suffering and sin seriously.",
      "Strong 'show, don't tell' narrative quality in the biblical scenes."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "The 'four-point' didactic structure could be more fluidly integrated into a single narrative arc.",
      "Some contemporary references (TV commercials, informal polls) slightly lower the aesthetic register.",
      "The transition between the historical critique (Auschwitz) and the theological solution could be more organic."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Reformed / Poetic-Imagistic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (reframing/anti-kitsch) and Paul Scott Wilson (imagery/Four Pages).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to intellectually engaged hearers who are weary of sentimentalism and seek a 'thick' theological description of reality.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with a more 'Lowry-esque' plot that avoids numbered points.",
      "Incorporate more 'silence' or 'pauses' in the written rhythm to reflect the Maundy Thursday 'Tenebrae'.",
      "Deepen the 'reframing' by connecting the 'horned lamb' to specific modern 'wild beasts' (ideologies)."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is an aesthetically strong performance of the Gospel. It succeeds because it allows the 'form' of the biblical imagery to dictate the 'content' of the message. By refusing to 'beautify' the cross, it finds a deeper, more 'sublime' beauty in the sacrifice of the Lamb. It is a model of how to use classical biblical imagery to speak to a post-Auschwitz world without losing the radicality of the 'Word from above.' Through its careful language and dramatic structure, it creates a space where the 'holy happens' and the hearer is invited to 'behold' rather than just 'look'."
