    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The preacher provides a solid exegetical foundation by situating Second Isaiah in the Babylonian Exile (550 BC) and linking it to Psalm 137. The theological 'Sache' is the transition from judgment to comfort. However, the factual side is quickly instrumentalized for political analogy. While the historical facts of the exile are clear, the dogmatic depth regarding the nature of 'guilt' (Schuld) remains somewhat thin, as it is immediately translated into systemic/political guilt. The complexity of the messianic vision is reduced to social justice. It is comprehensible but risks 'leveling' the biblical text to fit a specific 1980s socio-political context.",

    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a high degree of personal vulnerability and political passion. By sharing a personal anecdote about her daughter and the 'chocolate bunny,' she demonstrates a self-critical awareness of her own role as a 'comforter.' There is no 'image management' here; the preacher 'leaks' anger, grief over the Ramstein victims, and a deep sense of alienation from the West German 'economic miracle.' The 'I' is not used for self-aggrandizement but as a witness to the shared 'exilic' experience of the peace movement.",
      "quotes": [
        "Mama, du willst mich ja nur wegtrösten!",

      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Depressive/Hysterical hybrid. Depressive in the deep identification with the suffering and the search for 'Heimat' and closeness; Hysterical in the courageous, public-facing, and emotionally charged confrontation with the 'powers that be.'",

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 5,
      "analysis": "The relationship is characterized by a strong 'We-definition' ('Wir leben in Babylon'). The preacher positions herself as part of a suffering, marginalized minority. However, there is a significant 'relationship noise' toward those not in the inner circle. The preacher creates a sharp divide between the 'conscious minority' and the 'majority of the population' who are dismissed as being 'adjusted' to the 'babylonian lifestyle.' This creates a paternalistic/elitist tone toward the 'unawakened' hearer, potentially repelling those who do not share her specific political radicalism.",

    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 4,
      "analysis": "This is the most problematic side. The sermon heavily leans toward 'Anspruch' (Demand). While it begins with 'Trost' (Comfort), it quickly morphs into a call for 'messianic work' and 'road construction.' The theological 'Zuspruch' (Promise) is conditioned by human action: 'There is no comfort without this level path.' This risks turning the Gospel back into Law. The hearer is pressured to be a 'road worker' for God. The distinction between God's act and human ethics is blurred, leading to a high risk of moralism under the guise of 'messianic work.'",

        "Mit der Gabe kommt die Aufgabe.",

      "risk_of_moralism": "Very high. The listener is left with the burden of 'preparing the way' so that the Messiah can actually arrive.",

        "Powerful mobilization of the congregation against resignation.",

  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 5.5,
    "summary": "The sermon is a powerful example of 'Political Homiletics' from the late 20th century. It excels in authenticity (Green) and situational relevance, using the Ramstein tragedy to pierce the veil of middle-class security. However, from a Barthian perspective, it suffers from an 'over-actualization' where the biblical text is almost entirely absorbed by the political context. The psychological pressure exerted through the 'Appeal' side is significant; the Gospel of 'Comfort' is quickly transformed into a 'Law of Activism.' The preacher's identification of the 'People of God' with a 'minority of consciousness' creates a problematic ecclesiology that excludes the 'unawakened.' While communicatively gripping, it lacks the theological 'rest' (Sabbatical quality) of the Gospel, replacing the 'Acting Subject' (God) with the 'Acting Congregation.'",
    "barthian_warning": "High psychologization and sociologization. God's 'Coming' is made dependent on human 'road work,' threatening the sovereignty of Grace.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Radical honesty regarding collective fear and 'Todeswissen'.",
      "Masterful use of the 'Babylon' metaphor for contemporary alienation.",
      "Strong personal vulnerability (the chocolate bunny anecdote)."

    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Decouple the 'Promise' from the 'Demand' to avoid neo-legalism.",
      "Broaden the 'Yellow' address to include those outside the 'activist' bubble.",
      "Allow the 'Beauty of God' to be an end in itself, not just a motivation for work."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A courageous, prophetic, but theologically unbalanced sermon that risks exhausting the hearer with 'messianic' demands while seeking to comfort them."
