    "psychological_health_score": 8,
    "summary": "This sermon is remarkably healthy from a TA perspective. It avoids the typical 'Bait and Switch' of religious manipulation by refusing to offer the listener a false sense of control. Instead, it uses the Adult ego state to process the reality of death and the Nurturing Parent to provide a safe space for that processing. The preacher's use of self-disclosure (her own vanity, her own fear) prevents a hierarchy where the 'Perfect Parent' speaks to the 'Sinful Child.'",

    "areas_for_improvement": [
      "Occasional lapses into 'Ain't It Awful' regarding modern society.",
      "The 'Critical Parent' tone regarding assisted suicide might shut down Adult reflection for listeners struggling with that specific issue."
    ],
    "advice_for_game_free_communication": "To maintain this high level of authenticity, continue to frame moral imperatives (the 'musts') as personal convictions or shared values rather than universal dogmas, allowing the listener's Adult to choose the response."
