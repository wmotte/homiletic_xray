    "criterion_a1_imagery": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The sermon excels in 'showing' rather than 'telling.' Following Paul Scott Wilson’s homiletical theory, the preacher translates the abstract doctrine of the 'resurrection of the body' into concrete, sensory images. The use of the Guatemalan Easter card is a masterclass in vividness, replacing the static 'sunrise' cliché with 'radioactive' pottery and 'electric shock' hair. This creates a cinematic quality that helps the hearer visualize the 'staggering' nature of the event. The preacher also uses tactile imagery (warm hands, bloodied bodies) to ground the theological argument in human physicality. By contrasting the 'ugly brown bulb' with the 'explosively new' resurrection, the preacher avoids dead metaphors and forces the hearer to see the biblical text with fresh eyes.",
      "quotes": [
        "Another was throwing her pottery jar into the air as though it had suddenly become radioactive.",
        "The hair of one is standing straight up as though she had received an electric shock.",
        "The big husky fireman cradling the tiny dead toddler... the sight of the bloodied little limp body."

        "Some biblical quotes are long; paraphrasing them into sensory scenes would maintain the 'show' momentum."
      ],
      "show_vs_tell_balance": "Strongly tilted toward 'showing.' The preacher uses art, news photography, and personal anecdote to visualize the theology."
    },
    "criterion_a2_carefulness_and_precision": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The language is precise and demonstrates 'stewardship of language' as defined by McEntyre. The preacher carefully distinguishes between 'immortality of the soul' and 'resurrection of the body,' a nuance often lost in contemporary religious jargon. The tone is sophisticated yet accessible, avoiding 'Canaanite' dialect while maintaining theological integrity. There is a clear effort to define terms through contrast. However, the transition into the 'rapture' section at the end loses some of the earlier precision, moving into a more traditional, slightly more generic liturgical register. The use of the Rabin and Oklahoma City examples shows a high level of care in selecting cultural touchstones that carry significant emotional and physical weight without being exploitative.",

        "They were returning to the much more familiar religious idea of the immortality of the soul.",

        "The phrase 'all kinds of other generic religious beliefs' is a bit dismissive; more precision here could strengthen the contrast.",
        "The transition to the final 'rapture' section could use more of the specific, precise language seen in the first half.",
        "The use of 'stupid question' (referring to Paul) is bold but could be phrased with more rhetorical nuance."
      ],
      "jargon_analysis": "The preacher actively deconstructs religious jargon (like 'spiritualized resurrection') to reveal the underlying physical reality of the Gospel."
    },
    "criterion_a3_musicality_and_rhythm": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon has a solid oral rhythm, likely reflecting the preacher's experience in liturgical settings. There is a good use of parallelism, especially in the 'Changed!' section toward the end, which creates a rhythmic 'legato' effect. However, the middle section, which involves heavy exegetical lifting regarding Paul's arguments, becomes somewhat 'staccato' and 'paper-heavy.' The flow is occasionally interrupted by long block quotes from Scripture which, while authoritative, break the preacher's own rhythmic voice. The cadence is generally 'Sober-Reformed/Anglican'—dignified and steady, but lacking the poetic 'swing' or 'groove' found in more narrative-driven homiletics. It sounds like a text meant to be read from a pulpit with gravitas.",
      "quotes": [
        "Changed! our sinfulness exchanged for his righteousness, our mortality for his immortality, our sorrow for his joy.",
        "Bodies matter. Faces matter. We want to hold a warm hand, we want to see a beloved smile.",
        "Maybe. In view of what they had witnessed at Golgotha, I doubt it."

        "Good variation between anecdotal storytelling and theological proclamation."

      "improvement_points": [
        "Reduce the length of direct biblical quotations to allow the preacher's own rhythmic voice to carry the argument.",
        "The middle section regarding 'seeds and plants' feels a bit clunky and could be smoothed out for better oral delivery.",
        "More use of alliteration or assonance could increase the 'stickiness' of key phrases."
      ],
      "paper_language_diagnosis": "Primarily oral language, though the dense exegetical middle section leans toward 'paper language' due to the complexity of the Pauline argument."
    },
    "average_score_language": 7,
    "summary_language": "The sermon demonstrates a high level of micro-aesthetic quality. It avoids the 'kitsch' of sentimental Easter language by employing jarring, fresh imagery (the 'radioactive' pottery). The preacher practices 'stewardship of language' by carefully distinguishing between soul-immortality and body-resurrection. While the rhythm is occasionally slowed by dense biblical citations, the overall linguistic arc is one of clarity and sensory engagement. It successfully 'shows' the shock of the resurrection, making the ancient text feel physically present and urgent for a modern audience."

  "domain_b_dramaturgy_of_structure": {
    "criterion_b1_narrative_arc": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The sermon follows a clear 'Homiletical Plot' (Lowry). It begins by upsetting the equilibrium with the 'e-mail' anecdote, introducing the 'problem' of disembodied relationships. This moves into the theological 'conflict': the Corinthians' (and our) preference for the 'safe' immortality of the soul over the 'terrifying' resurrection of the body. The turning point is the description of the empty tomb and the 'staggering' nature of the event. The movement from 'dust' to 'heavenly image' provides a satisfying arc. However, the energy dips slightly in the middle during the discussion of Paul's 'predicament' with the seeds, before recovering for the final 'rapture' and doxology. It is a journey from the digital/abstract to the physical/concrete and finally to the transformed/eternal.",
      "quotes": [
        "The news of the Resurrection caused the women to run headlong from the scene.",
        "At this point Paul finds himself in a difficulty, and he is not altogether successful in getting himself out of it.",
        "Can you imagine anything more wonderful than this?"

        "The transition from the 'fireman' image back to the Pauline text is a bit abrupt.",
        "The middle section on 1 Cor 15:35 could be more dynamically integrated into the 'plot' rather than feeling like a commentary.",

    },
    "criterion_b2_integration_text_and_context": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "This is a strong example of Cilliers' 'Reframing.' The preacher takes the contemporary context (Internet relationships, news of tragedies like Oklahoma City) and places them within the frame of the Resurrection. The 'strangeness' of the biblical text (the terrified women) is respected and used to challenge the 'glow' of generic religion. The integration is organic; the preacher doesn't just 'apply' the text at the end but allows the text to interrogate the context throughout. The use of Rabin’s granddaughter and the fireman cradling the child are not just 'illustrations' but are used to prove the theological point that 'bodies matter.' This creates a synthesis where the biblical 'then' and the contemporary 'now' illuminate each other.",
      "quotes": [
        "Just as the Crucifixion has always been problematic, so too has the doctrine of the Resurrection of the body.",
        "We don't seem to want to believe in resurrected bodies. We want to be 'spiritual.'",
        "Jesus is right here. He is right here in a way that no one else has ever been."

      "strengths": [
        "Excellent 'reframing' of the Resurrection as a 'shock' rather than a 'comfort'.",

      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'Robert E. Lee' quote is very context-specific (Virginia) and might need more 'reframing' for a broader audience.",
        "The connection between 'e-mail' and 'Apostles' Creed' could be tightened.",
        "More 'reframing' of the 'heavenly body' in light of modern physics or biology could add another layer of depth."
      ],
      "reframing_present": "Yes. The sermon reframes 'hope' not as a feeling, but as a bodily reality anchored in a historical event."
    },
    "criterion_b3_openness_vs_closedness": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The sermon balances openness and closedness. By acknowledging the 'ineffable nature' and 'predicament' of explaining the resurrection, the preacher leaves room for mystery (Stark’s 'Open Work'). The admission that Paul was 'not altogether successful' in his analogies invites the hearer into the struggle of faith. However, the final section becomes quite 'closed' and declarative, using a series of 'all' statements ('all sins wiped away', 'all evil done to death') that, while traditionally comforting, leave less room for the 'ambivalence of existence' mentioned earlier. It moves from an 'open' exploration of shock and fear toward a 'closed' dogmatic celebration. While appropriate for Easter, it slightly diminishes the 'polyvalence' of the work.",
      "quotes": [
        "Most of us who are believers think that these discrepancies simply reflect the ineffable nature of the Resurrection.",
        "It is very difficult to describe how this can be...",
        "All our sins wiped away, all evil done to death forever..."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Honesty about the 'difficulty' of the Easter sermon.",
        "Respect for the 'discrepancies' in the Gospel accounts as signs of mystery.",
        "The invitation to 'grasp by faith' acknowledges the hearer's active role."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The ending could benefit from an 'open' question to keep the hearer reflecting after the 'Amen'.",
        "The 'all' statements in the conclusion could be nuanced to acknowledge the 'not yet' of the present world.",
        "Allow more room for the 'trembling and astonishment' of the women to linger in the hearer's mind."
      ],
      "open_work_diagnosis": "Starts as an 'open work' exploring mystery and fear, but closes into a more 'monovalent' dogmatic celebration at the end."
    },
    "average_score_structure": 7,
    "summary_structure": "The macro-aesthetic structure is effective and well-paced. It avoids the static 'three-point' sermon in favor of a narrative movement that shifts from modern disembodiment to the shocking physicality of the empty tomb. The integration of context (tragedy and technology) with the Pauline text is seamless and provides a genuine 'reframing' of reality. While the conclusion is somewhat dogmatically 'closed,' the overall journey respects the mystery of the subject matter and maintains a high level of engagement through 'dramaturgical' tension."
  },
  "kitsch_diagnosis": {
    "anti_kitsch_score": 8,
    "analysis": "The sermon is remarkably anti-kitsch. It explicitly attacks 'religious kitsch' by critiquing the 'usual image of the women kneeling reverently, bathed in the rays of sunrise.' The preacher rejects 'cheap comfort' (the 'glow' of immortality) in favor of the 'trembling and astonishment' of the biblical text. By using the 'radioactive' pottery imagery and the 'bloodied' body of a toddler, the preacher avoids 'pre-chewed emotions.' The sermon does not offer a 'happy ending' without first passing through the 'bitter and shameful end at Golgotha.' It sustains the tension between the 'man of dust' and the 'man of heaven' without resolving it through sentimentality.",
    "examples_of_kitsch": [
      "The 'usual one of the women kneeling reverently and peacefully, bathed in the rays of sunrise' (cited as a negative example).",
      "The 'ugly brown bulb' analogy (critiqued as insufficient)."

    "authentic_moments": [
      "The description of the Guatemalan card with the 'electric shock' hair.",
      "The reference to the granddaughter's grief over Rabin's 'warm hands'."
    ],
    "recommendation": "To maintain this high anti-kitsch level, ensure the final 'rapture' section doesn't lean too heavily on traditional 'joy' clichés without grounding them in the 'shock' established earlier."
  },
  "space_for_grace_analysis": {
    "space_score": 7,
    "analysis": "The sermon opens 'space for grace' by emphasizing that the resurrection is a 'completely new happening' that comes from 'beyond human capacity.' It avoids moralization; the focus is on what God has done, not what the hearer must do. By acknowledging the 'inexplicable power' and 'mystery' of the event, it leaves room for the Holy to act. However, the 'space' is slightly narrowed at the end by the rapid-fire list of 'all injustices... made right,' which can feel like 'explaining away' the current mystery of suffering. Nevertheless, the central theme—that grace is bodily and 'face-to-face'—creates a profound space for an encounter with the Risen Christ.",
    "tension_sustained": "Tensions between 'dust' and 'heaven' are sustained through most of the sermon, though resolved somewhat quickly in the final paragraph.",
    "mystery_respected": "High. The preacher explicitly mentions the 'ineffable nature' and 'mystery' of the resurrection.",
    "moralization_vs_grace": "Grace prevails. There is almost no moralistic 'we must,' but rather a 'God has' and 'we shall be changed.'",
    "recommendation": "Allow the 'not yet' of the 'man of dust' to remain in tension with the 'already' of the 'man of heaven' even in the conclusion."

  "overall_aesthetics": {
    "overall_aesthetic_score": 7.2,
    "summary": "This sermon is an aesthetically robust piece of homiletic work that successfully navigates the 'aesthetic turn.' It is particularly strong in its use of imagery and its ability to 'reframe' a familiar, often sentimentalized holiday (Easter) into a shocking, physical, and 'staggering' event. The preacher avoids the pitfalls of religious kitsch by rejecting 'spiritualized' clichés and insisting on the 'scandal' of the body. The language is 'stewardly'—precise, clear, and sensory. Structurally, it moves with a narrative arc that connects modern anxieties about digital disembodiment with the ancient promise of bodily resurrection. While the conclusion leans toward a more traditional and 'closed' liturgical style, the majority of the sermon functions as an 'open work' that invites the hearer into the mystery of the faith. It is a 'Sober-Poetic' sermon that respects both the intellect and the imagination of the hearer.",
    "strengths_top_3": [
      "Vivid, anti-kitsch imagery (the Guatemalan card, the 'radioactive' pottery).",
      "Sophisticated 'reframing' of the resurrection against 'generic immortality'.",
      "Strong integration of contemporary, physical grief as a theological argument."
    ],
    "improvement_points_top_3": [
      "Smoothing the transition between dense exegetical sections and narrative illustrations.",
      "Updating the 'Internet/e-mail' opening to reflect more current digital realities.",
      "Maintaining the 'openness' and 'mystery' of the narrative arc into the final doxology."
    ],
    "primary_aesthetic_style": "Sober-Poetic / Reframing-Imagistic",
    "comparison_with_specialists": "Fits Johan Cilliers (Reframing/Anti-kitsch) and Paul Scott Wilson (Imagery/Show don't tell).",
    "audience_analysis": "Aesthetically appeals to 'thinking' hearers who are weary of sentimental religion and appreciate a preacher who acknowledges the 'difficulty' and 'shock' of faith.",
    "recommendations_for_next_sermon": [
      "Experiment with more poetic 'musicality' in the middle sections to match the strength of the imagery.",
      "Use more 'open' endings to allow the 'shock' of the gospel to linger.",
      "Continue to deconstruct 'kitsch' images of biblical stories to find the 'staggering' reality beneath."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The sermon is a high-quality example of modern homiletics. It achieves aesthetic depth not through 'beautifying' the message, but by letting the 'form' of the resurrection (shock, body, mystery) dictate the 'form' of the sermon. By grounding the 'man of heaven' in the 'warm hands' of the 'man of dust,' the preacher creates a space where grace is not an abstract concept, but a performative reality. It is a successful 'aesthetic event' that honors the biblical text while speaking directly to the human condition."
