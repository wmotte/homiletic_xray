  "schulz_von_thun_analysis": {
    "factual_content_blue": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The preacher demonstrates high competence in the 'Sache'. The core argument is a Barthian insistence on God as the Acting Subject. The analysis of the Greek syntax ('their eyes were opened' as a divine passive) and the critique of liberal homiletics (where the disciples are the subjects of 'coming to believe') provide a robust dogmatic foundation. The preacher successfully distinguishes between 'nature-bound ideas' and the 'unprecedented nature of the event'. The factual content is not merely informative but polemic, aimed at correcting a specific theological drift toward anthropocentrism. It avoids dry intellectualism by linking the 'fact' of the resurrection to the 'fact' of the early church's survival.",
      "quotes": [
        "The syntax clearly indicates that their recognition of the risen Christ was initiated by God.",
        "In the quotations from the sermons I just read, God is not the acting subject of any of the sentences.",
        "The New Testament refers to death as an enemy."
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Sharp distinction between psychological 'experience' and theological 'event'.",
        "Clear exegetical grounding in the Matthean text."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "Could further explore the 'how' of the Resurrection's impact on contemporary ethics to ground the high dogmatics.",
        "The transition between the apocalyptic imagery of Revelation and the local context is abrupt."
      ],
      "comprehensibility_check": "High. While theologically dense, the use of contrast (liberal quotes vs. scripture) makes the abstract concepts accessible."
    },
    "self_revelation_green": {
      "score": 7,
      "analysis": "The preacher reveals a persona that is intellectually rigorous yet pastorally present. There is a conscious self-revelation regarding personal dissatisfaction with 'nebulous messages' ('I confess that it is not enough for me'). The preacher admits to the 'smell of death' from ministerial experience, which adds a layer of somber authenticity. However, there is a strong element of 'Selbstdarstellung' as the 'defender of the true faith' against 'urbane' skepticism. The 'I' is largely diaconal, serving to model a faith that has wrestled with doubt and found it wanting compared to the Gospel.",
      "quotes": [
        "I confess that it is not enough for me.",
        "I have learned to recognize the look, the feel, and the smell of death.",
        "I can feel the goosebumps on the back of my neck as I say this."
      ],
      "riemann_type_diagnosis": "Compulsive with Hysterical nuances. The preacher seeks 'correctness' and structural integrity in doctrine (Compulsive) but uses dramatic, evocative language and personal anecdotes to command the stage (Hysterical).",
      "diaconal_quality": "The 'I' serves the text by acting as a proxy for the listener's potential skepticism, then leading them toward the text's conclusion.",
      "strengths": [
        "Vulnerability regarding the 'horrible indignity' of death.",
        "Authentic passion for the subject matter."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The 'anti-intellectual intellectual' stance can feel slightly performative.",
        "Risk of appearing superior to the 'timid' preachers mentioned."

    "relational_aspect_yellow": {
      "score": 6,
      "analysis": "The relationship is defined as 'Teacher/Guide to Seekers'. The preacher uses 'we' to create solidarity ('the Easter greeting that we have just exchanged'), but quickly shifts to a confrontational 'you' ('Do you believe what you have said?'). There is a paternalistic edge when discussing the 'Ivy League' student or 'sophisticated' churchgoers. The preacher assumes the role of the one who must 'stare down' the congregation's potential embarrassment. While solidary in the face of death, the preacher is authoritative—almost stern—regarding the necessity of belief.",
      "quotes": [
        "Do you believe what you have said?",
        "Maybe it is enough for you. I confess that it is not enough for me.",
        "If that doesn't make your hair stand on end, I have not read it right."

      "relationship_noise_check": "The critique of other preachers and 'sophisticated' people might create a 'Relationship Ear' reaction of feeling judged or patronized among the more skeptical listeners.",

    },
    "appeal_aspect_red": {
      "score": 8,
      "analysis": "The appeal is primarily an invitation to 'Faith/Trust' (Zuspruch) rather than a 'Demand/Action' (Anspruch). The preacher avoids moralism entirely. The 'Red Side' here is the call to stop being 'ashamed' and to accept the 'Gift' of the Resurrection. The ratio is heavily weighted toward the Promise. The appeal is: 'Let this message give you joy.' It is a call to ontological rest in the victory of Christ. The 'Law' in this sermon is the exposure of the futility of human-centered hope, which serves to make the 'Gospel' (the divine act) more luminous.",
      "quotes": [
        "May God confirm this miracle in our lives.",
        "May this incredible message give you joy today and always.",
        "Go quickly and tell his disciples..."

      "zuspruch_vs_anspruch_balance": "Excellent. The 'Anspruch' (to believe) is presented as a logical and joyful response to the 'Zuspruch' (the empty tomb).",
      "risk_of_moralism": "Very low. There is no list of 'Easter duties', only the duty to marvel.",
      "strengths": [
        "Avoidance of 'Easter as a metaphor for self-improvement'.",
        "Focus on the 'extra nos' (outside of us) nature of the Gospel."
      ],
      "improvement_points": [
        "The appeal to 'not be ashamed' could be more gently invited rather than demanded.",
        "The final blessing is strong but could link more to the 'Galilee' of everyday life."

    "dominant_side": "Blue (Factual/Theological Content)",
    "disruptions": "A slight 'yellow' noise occurs when the preacher mocks 'urbane' skepticism, which may alienate the very people the sermon seeks to reach.",
    "healing_disruption": "The critique of the 'Ivy League' sermon serves as a healing disruption; it forces the listener to realize that a 'polite' Gospel is no Gospel at all."

  "reception_simulation": {
    "the_factual_ear_hears": "The Resurrection is an objective, historical, and divine event that defies human logic and medical science.",
    "the_relational_ear_hears": "The preacher thinks I might be a 'sophisticated' skeptic who is too embarrassed to admit the truth.",
    "the_appeal_ear_hears": "I should stop trying to 'explain' Jesus and instead trust in the power of God who raises the dead.",
    "the_self_revelation_ear_hears": "This preacher has seen death up close and finds no comfort in liberal theology; they are deeply committed to the 'scandal' of the Cross."
  },
  "overall_picture": {
    "overall_communication_score": 7.5,
    "summary": "This is a robust, intellectually rigorous sermon that successfully navigates the tension between modern skepticism and ancient kerygma. The preacher utilizes the 'Blue Side' (Factual Content) to dismantle the psychologization of the Resurrection, moving the focus from the 'disciples' belief' to 'God's act'. This is a classic Barthian move: God is the Subject. The 'Green Side' (Self-revelation) provides necessary weight, as the preacher’s own encounter with death validates the rejection of 'nebulous' hope. While the 'Yellow Side' (Relationship) occasionally borders on the paternalistic by critiquing 'sophisticated' congregants, it serves the 'Red Side' (Appeal) by clearing the ground for a radical promise. The sermon avoids the trap of moralism, landing firmly on the 'Zuspruch' of the Gospel. It is a 'strong' sermon (8) in its theological clarity, though slightly lowered by the potential 'noise' of its polemic tone.",
    "barthian_warning": "The sermon is an antidote to psychologization. It explicitly warns against making God an object of our 'experience' and insists on His sovereignty.",
    "top_3_strengths": [
      "Theological precision regarding the 'divine passive'.",
      "Effective use of contrast to highlight the uniqueness of the Gospel.",
      "Authentic pastoral gravity regarding the reality of death."
    ],
    "top_3_improvement_points": [
      "Softening the polemic against 'urbane' skepticism to increase relational receptivity.",
      "Bridging the gap between the 'battle imagery' and the 'snowy New England day' more fluidly.",
      "Providing a concrete example of how this 'victory' manifests in a life of faith beyond 'joy'."
    ],
    "conclusion": "A high-quality homiletical piece that prioritizes the 'Sache' of the Gospel over the 'Ego' of the preacher, achieving communicative integrity through theological conviction."
