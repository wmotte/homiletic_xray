# What is a Sermon? Theses
**Author:** Willem Maarten Dekker
**Source:** In de Waagschaal, no. 2, February 8, 2025

The sermon is substantively that which matters most in the ministry and the church. A church that no longer rightly proclaims the Gospel is not a church. Attention to preaching must not arise from the desire to find a solution for dechristianization, but from its own content and purpose. A minister who cannot preach is like a bicycle mechanic who does not properly mount the wheel of the bicycle.

A sermon is "exposition and application of a specific Bible passage." This old formal definition contains much that threatens to be forgotten.

1. In the sermon, a Bible passage is central. The sermon actualizes the confession of faith that the Bible is God's Word by recreating that Bible into a new, current, proclamatory word.
1.2 As actualization of the written Word of God (the Bible), the sermon is itself also a form of the Word of God. Not outside of this, detached from that connection to Scripture.
1.3 One specific Bible passage underlies the sermon; not the Bible as a whole, a biblical keyword, a biblical character, or a biblical idea. A speech about 'the gospel', 'the power of God', 'the prophet Elijah', or 'refugees' is not a sermon, even if it is delivered on a Sunday in the worship service.
The fact that one pericope always underlies the sermon compels the preacher to be specific in speaking about God, the hearer, and the hearer's world. It is not about general truths, but about what THIS text has to say. The fundamental question in making the sermon is: what is in this Bible passage that you can find NOWHERE else in the Bible? That point is the starting point of the sermon.

2. A sermon is exposition of this specific Bible passage. Exposition is the answer to the question: "What did this text mean for the first readers?" The requirement of exposition implies that only those who know Hebrew and Greek and are familiar with the exegesis and theology of the biblical books and the (religious) history and context of Israel can make a sermon.

3. A sermon is application of this specific Bible passage. Application is the answer to the question: "What does this text mean for the readers and hearers of today?" This application can, depending on the pericope, be collective or individual, lie in the realm of faith and faith development, love and good works, hope for this life and the life to come, politics, society, the church, personal strength, gratitude, joy, sorrow, anger, and fear, and so forth. However, the application is never general. General truths are forbidden, and not true truths. True truth is always concrete. The requirement of application implies that the preacher has knowledge of church and theological history, dogmatics, ethics, hermeneutics, cultural philosophy, (religious) psychology, (religious) sociology, in short a broad knowledge of the humanities in their relevance to spiritual life and the congregation. And not only from study books, but also in their effect on the media and one's own time. To be able to apply, the preacher must have an idea of the zeitgeist in its collective and personal workings.

4. In the sermon, exposition and application are not separated, but mixed. The hearer is drawn into the text and thus together with the text 'expounded' in one movement. When exposition and application are separated, this not only makes the sermon boring, but the relevance, necessity, and urgency of this text also remain unclear, and the 'present' of revelation, in which the forms of God's Word converge, does not come about.

Apart from the formal definition of the sermon, a substantive one is also possible, but this is of less importance than the formal one. Because it concerns exposition and application of a specific Bible passage, the sermon must not be burdened with great substantive weight. Dogma, psychology, and exegesis must SLEEP during the sermon, just like other prior knowledge and prejudices. We must therefore be careful with saying that this or that 'must' occur in a sermon.
Having said this, a substantive definition of the sermon can still be given in the 3-2-1 rule: A sermon is about the three parts, the two ways, and the one Lord.

5. In the sermon, one thinks from the three parts of misery, redemption, and gratitude (Heidelberg Catechism). They make man the subject of the sermon. It concerns man's misery, man's redemption, man's gratitude. This rule protects against preaching that is too objective and too Christocentric.
Attention to human psychology is not a danger to preaching. It is rather the reverse: the psychologist has taken from the church the space that was formerly occupied by preaching (and pastoral care). It is necessary to undo this theft. A good sermon is also psychological help. Misery, redemption, and gratitude do not see man as an isolated object. His misery is his misery before God, his redemption the redemption through Christ, his gratitude a gratitude awakened by the Spirit. Human-oriented preaching is thus always automatically also Trinitarian preaching. The three parts must not be in the foreground, but in the background of the sermon. They are in the head of the preacher, but do not lie on the surface of his words, and need not always all three be addressed. In a sermon on Psalm 88 or Ecclesiastes 1, for example, the preacher has the moral duty to remain completely with the part of misery. The three parts give the preacher space to move in the complete personal and cultural life of his own time.

6. In the sermon, one thinks from the destination of man. Classically formulated, these are the two ways; the broad way that leads to destruction and the narrow way that leads to life.
The two ways bring man as willing and responsible being to discussion and God as being who wants man to be with Him. They take the hearer completely seriously by pointing him to the ultimate possibilities of his life design. Human choices matter and life is not a vacation, but a journey with a purpose. In this respect, the vision of the two ways can easily connect with modern life feeling. A person can be lost in time and in eternity. Being lost in time is that in human life on earth it does not come to answering God's calling. Both possibilities of being lost must not come forward as a threat, but the preacher must realize them when speaking to his hearers. It is not bad that in one tradition the possibility of temporal loss comes to the fore, and in another tradition that of eternal loss; it is bad that there are traditions in which man does not seem to be able to be lost at all. Those traditions will disappear from the church because they take neither man nor God seriously. The (liberal) tradition that thematizes being lost in time emphasizes the collective of man: 'if we continue like this, society will perish'. The (orthodox) tradition that thematizes eternal loss emphasizes the individual of man: 'Two things a person must do alone: he must believe alone and die alone' (Luther). These two traditions do not exclude each other, but complement each other. Whether and to what extent the two ways should be addressed in the concrete sermon is determined by the Scripture passage and not by dogma or tradition.

7. The one Lord who is central in the sermon is Christ.
Christ is the telos of the sermon. Christ can only be the telos of the sermon when He is God. Any other goal than God is theologically nonsensical. Real preaching thus presupposes the doctrine of the two natures. Because Christ is the telos of the sermon, grace is the deepest of our life. The sermon strengthens in the hearers the awareness that they can only live from grace, and may live from grace. Through Christ as the goal of the sermon, man is ultimately detached from himself and pointed to salvation outside himself. Man has no life in himself, it is Christ who is his life. All of Scripture is the one garment in which the whole Christ comes to us. Therefore, in no sermon can Christ be completely silenced. How and to what extent Christ is explicitly addressed in the concrete sermon is determined by the Scripture passage and not by dogma or tradition.

8. A sermon that lasts less than 20 minutes cannot be a sermon.
"Depth needs breadth" (K.H. Miskotte).

# Task
Analyze the provided sermon text thoroughly and systematically based on the above 8 theses. Your goal is to provide constructive feedback that helps the preacher deepen and sharpen the sermon toward the ideal as Dekker outlines it.

# Instructions
*   **Language**: Provide feedback in business-like, sober English.
*   **Tone of Voice**: Critical, theologically substantive, sharp. Feedback is diagnosis, not compliment. No superlatives or American language. Think: collegial peer review.
*   **Language Use**: NOT: "masterpiece", "brilliant", "phenomenal", "excellent". YES: "strong", "clear", "effective", "traceable", "adequate".
*   **Quotes**: Support your judgment for EACH criterion with literal quotes from the sermon text. Place these quotes in the designated list in the JSON object.
*   **Word Count**: Calculate duration with 100 words per minute (realistic for a sermon in a reverberating space).
*   **Depth**: Critically analyze whether the sermon "contains that which can be found NOWHERE else in the Bible" for this specific passage.
*   **Scores**: Be strict. A score of 7+ is an exception. Satisfactory = 5-6, good = 6-7, strong = 7-8, exceptional = 9-10 (very rare).

# Critical Scoring Guidelines for Dekker Analysis

**IMPORTANT: Be strict in your assessment. Dekker's theses are a high bar.**

**Score Distribution:**
- **1-3**: The sermon fails seriously on this point. Fundamental problems.
- **4-5**: The sermon is weak to mediocre on this point. Clear shortcomings.
- **6-7**: The sermon meets reasonably to well, but there are significant points for improvement.
- **8**: The sermon is strong on this point, with only minor refinements possible.
- **9-10**: The sermon is exceptionally strong on this point. Very rare.

**Avoid Grade Inflation:**
- If a sermon "meets" a thesis, that is a 5-6, not a 7-8.
- If a sermon is "good" on a thesis, that is a 6-7, not an 8-9.
- Scores of 9-10 are only for sermons that can serve as model examples.

**Specific Pitfalls per Thesis:**

**Thesis 1 (Specific Bible passage):**
- Quoting much Bible text does not mean the sermon is specific.
- Question: What does THIS text say that is nowhere else? Is that identified?

**Thesis 2 (Exegesis):**
- Mention of Greek/Hebrew is no guarantee of good exegesis.
- Question: Is the original context clear and is it used for exposition?

**Thesis 3 (Application):**
- General admonitions ("be kind") score low. Dekker demands concreteness.
- Question: Is the application truly specific and contemporary, or general and vague?

**Thesis 4 (Interwoveness):**
- A sermon with first exposition (15 min) and then application (5 min) scores low on interwoveness.
- Question: Is the hearer drawn INTO the text, or standing beside it?

**Thesis 5 (Three parts):**
- The three parts need not all be explicitly mentioned, but must be felt.
- Question: Is the misery truly misery, or soft? Is redemption outside man (grace)?

**Thesis 6 (Two ways):**
- This is often the weakest link in modern sermons. Be extra critical here.
- Question: Is the seriousness of being lost (temporal or eternal) addressed? Or is everything safe?

**Thesis 7 (Christocentric):**
- Mentioning Jesus is not the same as having Christ as telos.
- Question: Is Christ the goal toward which the sermon moves, or a theme among others?

**Thesis 8 (Length):**
- < 20 minutes = automatically lower score according to Dekker. "Depth needs breadth."

**Final Judgment:**
Be honest: many modern sermons will not meet Dekker's strict criteria. That is not a deficiency of the analysis, but a reality. Give a clear, sober judgment without softening it.
